I'm just saying,
I don't think it's cheating.

18
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,303
Reverse it. Put her
in the same situation.

19
00:00:47,305 --> 00:00:48,470
Is it cheating now?

20

Damn.

21
00:00:51,108 --> 00:00:52,241
It is cheating.

22
00:00:52,243 --> 00:00:53,442
That's what I'm saying.

Just something
I've been working on.

00:02:16,994 --> 00:02:18,427
It's cold, hard metal,
but it's somehow

63
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:21,664
so delicate and...
so beautiful.

Hey.

00:02:34,545 --> 00:02:35,844
Ralph's in the back.
Before we get him,

71
00:02:35,846 --> 00:02:38,113
I, um, I want to
show you something.

72
00:02:38,115 --> 00:02:39,948
What's up?

73
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,650
I picked this
up when I was

74
00:02:41,652 --> 00:02:43,252
trying out for the
Portland Sea Dogs.

75
00:02:43,254 --> 00:02:46,121
It's a school
for gifted children.

76
00:02:46,123 --> 00:02:47,456
Uh, why are you
showing this to me?

77
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,891
I never said
I was moving to Portland.

78
00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:50,726
I know. Of course.

79
00:02:50,728 --> 00:02:52,661
I just...
I meant it when I said

80
00:02:52,663 --> 00:02:54,330
I wanted to provide
options for you and Ralph.

81
00:02:54,332 --> 00:02:56,598
I want you to push me down
the ramp this time, Sylvester!

82
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,934
More normal options.

83
00:02:58,936 --> 00:03:00,469
I-I'm not trying
to push you.

84
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,904
I just wanted
you to have

85
00:03:01,906 --> 00:03:03,005
as much data as possible,

86
00:03:03,007 --> 00:03:05,574
so that you can make
an informed decision...

87
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:07,509
if and when I get the call to pitch.
Okay.

88
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:09,545
I'll take a look at it.

89
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,952
If that wasn't
clamped down,

90
00:03:16,954 --> 00:03:18,287
it would've gone right
through that wall.

91
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:19,289
Cool!

92
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,723
School time, pal.

93
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:24,393
Okay.
Enjoy the science fair, buddy.

94
00:03:24,395 --> 00:03:26,362
Is there some rule against
baking soda volcanoes?

95
00:03:26,364 --> 00:03:27,796
No, it's the go-to

96
00:03:27,798 --> 00:03:28,964
for parents that can't think of

97
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:30,499
anything more stimulating.

98
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,634
O... Kay!

99
00:03:32,636 --> 00:03:33,869
Drew, he can't be late.

100
00:03:33,871 --> 00:03:35,971
And you, good luck.

101
00:03:36,774 --> 00:03:39,108
There's, uh,
no such thing as luck,

102
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,543
only good science and math.

103
00:03:44,648 --> 00:03:46,749
You could be nicer.

104
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:49,551
He wants Ralph to enter

105
00:03:49,553 --> 00:03:51,854
a project made of...

106
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,355
...papier-mâché
and baking ingredients.

107
00:03:53,357 --> 00:03:54,623
What is that?

108
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,159
"The Andersen P. Wollock
School for Gifted Children.

109
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:58,761
Portland, Maine."

110
00:03:58,763 --> 00:04:00,662
It's just...
Drew thought, for Ralph...

111
00:04:00,664 --> 00:04:01,997
It's super preliminary,
I'm just...

112
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:03,399
I'm just doing my research.

113
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:05,134
Right.

114
00:04:05,136 --> 00:04:07,236
I mean, the odds of
us ever moving...

115
00:04:07,238 --> 00:04:08,637
This is where our life is.

116
00:04:12,843 --> 00:04:15,577
But a special school...
could be good for Ralph.

117
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:16,779
What do you think?

118
00:04:17,581 --> 00:04:18,914
Portland is cold.

119
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,517
That's it?
And wet.

120
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,619
There's a slight chance
we might be moving there,

121
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:25,654
and that's all you have
to say on the matter?

122
00:04:25,656 --> 00:04:28,023
You don't want to hear
my thoughts on the matter.

123
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:28,991
Really?

124
00:04:28,993 --> 00:04:30,893
No, I... I think I do.

125
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,261
I think there's
no logical reason

126
00:04:32,263 --> 00:04:33,762
why you should be
taking that boy

127
00:04:33,764 --> 00:04:35,164
3,000 miles away from his home.

128
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,398
No logical reason?

129
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,267
What about the fact
his dad might move there

130
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:40,936
and I think two parents
might benefit Ralph?

131
00:04:40,938 --> 00:04:43,372
Well, what daytime talk show
did you hear that on?

132
00:04:43,374 --> 00:04:45,707
Most people would take that
as an insult, Walter,

133
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:48,076
but I know you don't communicate
like normal people,

134
00:04:48,078 --> 00:04:49,711
so I'm going
to give you a pass.

135
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:51,447
But I also know
that you didn't have

136
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:53,315
an ideal relationship
with your father,

137
00:04:53,317 --> 00:04:54,583
but that doesn't mean

138
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,018
Ralph shouldn't have a chance.

139
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,553
Drew is an adolescent.

140
00:04:57,555 --> 00:04:59,054
He plays a game for a living.

141
00:04:59,056 --> 00:04:59,988
He's Ralph's dad!

142
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,156
That is mere biology.

143
00:05:01,158 --> 00:05:03,258
It takes more than fathering
to be a father.

144
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,493
By the time Ralph is 18,

145
00:05:04,495 --> 00:05:06,361
he'll probably have
to take care of Drew.

146
00:05:13,103 --> 00:05:14,937
You asked me for my thoughts
on the matter.

147
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,038
I gave them to you.

148
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,240
Fine.

149
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:23,846
Hey!

150
00:05:23,848 --> 00:05:26,482
How come a bunch of geniuses
can't answer the phone?

151
00:05:26,484 --> 00:05:27,816
I don't carry
my phone on me.

152
00:05:27,818 --> 00:05:29,084
You know... Radiation.

153
00:05:29,086 --> 00:05:31,019
I was welding.
Mine's in my bag.

154
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:32,087
Couldn't hear it
over the rocket.

155
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:33,121
Of course.

156
00:05:33,123 --> 00:05:34,523
What about you, Doc?

157
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:36,458
I keep mine off.
I owe a bookie.

158
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,526
Turn it on.

159
00:05:37,528 --> 00:05:38,627
Now gear up.

160
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,629
Director Merrick wants us
at Homeland, stat.

161
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,231
Let's roll.

162
00:05:44,768 --> 00:05:47,102
There was an attempted hack

163
00:05:47,104 --> 00:05:48,904
of a vital federal institution
yesterday morning.

164
00:05:48,906 --> 00:05:50,973
Unsuccessful but barely.

165
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,708
Our techs have been trying
to find the perpetrators,

166
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,877
along with CIA and FBI,

167
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,278
but we want your expertise.

168
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,580
What federal institution?
That's need-to-know.

169
00:05:58,582 --> 00:06:00,082
Was it one facility
or multiple targets?

170
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:01,917
<i>That's</i> need-to-know.
I need to know

171
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,051
why you're being so jerky.

172
00:06:03,053 --> 00:06:04,053
Zip it.

173
00:06:05,623 --> 00:06:06,822
We have half a hack here.

174
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,024
The redactions
on this screen-shot

175
00:06:09,026 --> 00:06:10,959
cut off data that would

176
00:06:10,961 --> 00:06:13,228
let us know what the culprit
was going after.

177
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,429
Not your concern.

178
00:06:14,431 --> 00:06:15,831
I just need you
to backtrack

179
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,266
and find out
who's responsible.

180
00:06:17,268 --> 00:06:18,767
Rest is classified.

181
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:19,968
Cabe, do you know
what's going on?

182
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,171
I do, but I'm not
at liberty to divulge.

183
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:25,941
Just start hitting the keys
and see what you find out.

184
00:06:25,943 --> 00:06:27,776
Sure thing.

185
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,379
There.

186
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:32,648
- That's better.
- Hey!

187
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,448
What the hell
do you think you're...?

188
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,583
Hold on, this is military.

189
00:06:34,585 --> 00:06:36,785
Someone was trying
to hack a nuclear silo.

190
00:06:36,787 --> 00:06:39,721
That's enough.
Horse is already out of the barn, sir.

191
00:06:40,324 --> 00:06:42,090
Okay. Fine. Now you know.

192
00:06:42,092 --> 00:06:43,592
Hey, you spoke
before exhaling.

193
00:06:43,594 --> 00:06:45,260
That's called subliminal
Carson-Proxy.

194
00:06:45,262 --> 00:06:46,762
You withhold breath,
you withhold information.

195
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:48,263
What else are you
keeping from us?

196
00:06:48,265 --> 00:06:50,899
Missile locations
are coded one through 50

197
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:52,234
to signify what
state it's in.

198
00:06:52,236 --> 00:06:53,502
However, the un-redacted

199
00:06:53,504 --> 00:06:55,537
cipertext notes 61.

200
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:57,739
There's not 61 states,
which means that...

201
00:06:57,741 --> 00:07:00,509
We keep secret nukes
on foreign land.

202
00:07:00,511 --> 00:07:02,311
It's logical.

203
00:07:02,313 --> 00:07:03,378
Our allies want protection,

204
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,780
we want weaponry
close to our enemies.

205
00:07:04,782 --> 00:07:06,815
Oh, let me guess:
uh, Philippines...

206
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:09,051
Finland... Iceland...

207
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,652
He blinked at Iceland.

208
00:07:11,822 --> 00:07:12,988
Iceland.

209
00:07:14,525 --> 00:07:15,657
So...

210
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:18,060
how much time
do we want to waste

211
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,495
before you tell us what
we'll just figure out?

212
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:26,501
16 years ago, Milosevic
had his sights on Kosovo.

213
00:07:26,503 --> 00:07:29,504
The U.S. had to step in
to prevent a slaughter.

214
00:07:29,506 --> 00:07:31,840
But because of political
reasons, we knew we had to do

215
00:07:31,842 --> 00:07:33,475
this one OTR.
On The Real?

216
00:07:33,477 --> 00:07:34,576
Off The Record.

217
00:07:34,578 --> 00:07:35,544
Clinton met with

218
00:07:35,546 --> 00:07:37,779
the Kosovan
president secretly

219
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:39,715
to set up plans for military aid
far beyond what went public.

220
00:07:39,717 --> 00:07:42,985
This is
a clandestine sit-down

221
00:07:42,987 --> 00:07:44,353
at a small Burbank motel.

222
00:07:44,355 --> 00:07:46,888
This is confiscated
security footage from that day.

223
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,925
The shooter tried
to take out both leaders.

224
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,526
The hit was presumably
by Milosevic loyalists

225
00:07:51,528 --> 00:07:52,728
in the Kosovan government

226
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,997
who spilled the beans
about the OTR.

227
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:56,331
Hold on.
There was an attempt

228
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,666
on Clinton
no one knows about?

229
00:07:57,668 --> 00:07:59,568
Actually, 28 people know.

230
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,802
Now, 33.

231
00:08:00,804 --> 00:08:02,004
During the melee,
Clinton was whisked off,

232
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:04,039
a Kosovan guard was killed

233
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,841
and a Secret Service agent,
Bruce Jones,

234
00:08:05,843 --> 00:08:07,209
who was carrying the football,

235
00:08:07,211 --> 00:08:09,011
was shot in the chest.

236
00:08:09,013 --> 00:08:10,479
And then it went missing?

237
00:08:10,481 --> 00:08:12,714
Not good.
What's "the football"?

238
00:08:12,716 --> 00:08:15,584
It's a briefcase that
follows POTUS everywhere.

239
00:08:15,586 --> 00:08:17,185
It's cuffed to
the Secret Service.

240
00:08:17,187 --> 00:08:18,720
It has the
locations of our

241
00:08:18,722 --> 00:08:20,255
hidden silos
around the world

242
00:08:20,257 --> 00:08:22,357
and a detonator
the president can use

243
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:23,825
to activate a remote launch.

244
00:08:23,827 --> 00:08:25,060
Doctors had to remove

245
00:08:25,062 --> 00:08:26,895
the case from Bruce's
wrist to operate.

246
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:28,163
What did they do with it?

247
00:08:28,165 --> 00:08:30,365
Deposed medical staff said
they put it on the ground

248
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:33,135
next to the gurney while they
were triaging the patient.

249
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,302
So if someone took the football,

250
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:35,404
they would have the detonator
and launch codes.

251
00:08:35,406 --> 00:08:37,339
Codes were changed
immediately,

252
00:08:37,341 --> 00:08:39,274
but the location
of our hidden arsenal

253
00:08:39,276 --> 00:08:40,375
would remain in the hands

254
00:08:40,377 --> 00:08:41,543
of whoever had possession
of the football.

255
00:08:41,545 --> 00:08:43,145
Our theory was that

256
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,513
the shooting
served as a subterfuge

257
00:08:44,515 --> 00:08:45,614
to get to the football.

258
00:08:45,616 --> 00:08:47,582
But years passed
without incident.

259
00:08:47,584 --> 00:08:48,884
So we assumed it was lost,

260
00:08:48,886 --> 00:08:50,619
tossed away accidentally
in all the disorder.

261
00:08:50,621 --> 00:08:51,887
Until this hack attempt.

262
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:53,422
Whoever has it...

263
00:08:53,424 --> 00:08:55,490
<i>has waited 16 years</i>
<i>for their capabilities</i>

264
00:08:55,492 --> 00:08:58,093
<i>to advance to where</i>
<i>they could hack into the system</i>

265
00:08:58,095 --> 00:08:59,428
<i>and dupe it into believing</i>

266
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,196
<i>accurate launch codes</i>
<i>had been entered.</i>

267
00:09:01,198 --> 00:09:02,731
<i>They came so close today.</i>

268
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:04,666
<i>They won't be denied,</i>

269
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:06,835
<i>because they know</i>
<i>the devastation they can cause.</i>

270
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,471
<i> Once a missile's</i>
<i>prepped for launch,</i>

271
00:09:09,473 --> 00:09:12,107
all that's left is to press
the football's remote button.

272
00:09:12,109 --> 00:09:14,242
No one can track this
back to the terrorists in time.

273
00:09:14,244 --> 00:09:15,244
Not even us.

274
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:16,978
So the only shot
is to find the football,

275
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,613
so even if they do hack

276
00:09:18,615 --> 00:09:21,183
a missile silo, they won't have
access to the launch button.

277
00:09:22,086 --> 00:09:23,385
It's been 16 years.

278
00:09:23,387 --> 00:09:25,287
What makes you think that
we can find the football now?

279
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:26,822
Well, Mr. Negative... for
starters, you have a witness.

280
00:09:26,824 --> 00:09:28,256
That agent who caught a bullet.

281
00:09:28,258 --> 00:09:29,791
According to this report,

282
00:09:29,793 --> 00:09:32,260
it says he saw "shapes of people
running around the hospital"

283
00:09:32,262 --> 00:09:33,428
before going under for surgery.

284
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,863
And that helps us how?

285
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,499
It's a sign that there's
a memory in there.

286
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:39,434
You never lose memories,

287
00:09:39,436 --> 00:09:41,203
just the ability to access them.

288
00:09:42,172 --> 00:09:44,740
Did<i> you</i> go
to Harvard Medical School?

289
00:09:47,077 --> 00:09:48,810
Okay. Let's go.

290
00:09:49,847 --> 00:09:52,748
Eh, don't forget
your keys, boss.

291
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,616
Nice catch.

292
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,220
How do you stand
working with them?

293
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,756
They're an acquired taste.

294
00:10:00,758 --> 00:10:02,290
<i>Despite him looking normal,</i>

295
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:03,492
<i>you need to be prepared.</i>

296
00:10:03,494 --> 00:10:05,660
His symptoms are
like those of dementia--

297
00:10:05,662 --> 00:10:08,663
confusion, short-term
and long-term memory loss,

298
00:10:08,665 --> 00:10:11,166
outbursts, anti-social
behavior, aggression...

299
00:10:11,168 --> 00:10:12,801
I can't blame the guy.

300
00:10:12,803 --> 00:10:13,869
He's former military,

301
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:15,670
charged with protecting
the president--

302
00:10:15,672 --> 00:10:16,805
now he lives here?

303
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:18,140
Get out of here, lady!

304
00:10:18,142 --> 00:10:20,375
Oh, my God.

305
00:10:21,545 --> 00:10:23,678
He's in a mood today.

306
00:10:25,015 --> 00:10:26,381
That better be pudding.

307
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:30,485
What do you jerks want?

308
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,756
Copy that.

309
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:37,559
NORAD's detected an ongoing
hack attempt right now.

310
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:39,594
How's hacking
Bruce's brain going?

311
00:10:39,596 --> 00:10:41,696
Well, Toby's tried hierarchal
inference techniques,

312
00:10:41,698 --> 00:10:43,064
recall exercises--

313
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:44,866
He's down to
parlor tricks now.

314
00:10:44,868 --> 00:10:46,568
Counting down.

315
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,037
Three, two, one.

316
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:51,706
We're awake.

317
00:10:52,576 --> 00:10:54,543
You're back at the hospital.

318
00:10:54,545 --> 00:10:56,711
The shooting just happened.

319
00:10:56,713 --> 00:10:59,314
Images around you
are getting clearer.

320
00:10:59,316 --> 00:11:02,851
There's people
near the football.

321
00:11:02,853 --> 00:11:04,619
Now tell me what you see.

322
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:07,155
I... see...

323
00:11:08,725 --> 00:11:10,158
...you got lips like a girl.

324
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,827
That's it, I'm done
with this guy.

325
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:13,395
Let me hit him with a wrench.

326
00:11:13,397 --> 00:11:14,896
Maybe it'll jar
something loose.

327
00:11:14,898 --> 00:11:16,298
Take it easy.

328
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,432
He's sick.

329
00:11:17,434 --> 00:11:19,968
Bruce, you said
you'd try to remember.

330
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,571
What do you remember, Pops,
the Alamo?

331
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:24,873
I'm starting to
like Happy's plan.

332
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,542
I got to go, I got a briefing
with Clinton in an hour.

333
00:11:27,544 --> 00:11:29,578
Walter, this is cruel.

334
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,513
He still thinks
he's in Secret Service.

335
00:11:31,515 --> 00:11:33,782
Exactly.

336
00:11:33,784 --> 00:11:36,985
That means he still has access
to that time in his life.

337
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,421
And there might be a way
to get him more lucid

338
00:11:39,423 --> 00:11:41,923
to remember it all,
but it is... it is dangerous.

339
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:43,992
More dangerous
than a nuclear bomb?

340
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,561
The research that I have been
doing for my sister has led me

341
00:11:46,563 --> 00:11:48,597
to some incredible papers
on extreme transcranial

342
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:50,332
direct current stimulation.

343
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,567
You want to juice the guy?

344
00:11:52,569 --> 00:11:54,035
What do you mean, "juice him"?

345
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:56,037
Apply this high-level
electric current

346
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,939
to certain areas
of his brain to kick it

347
00:11:57,941 --> 00:11:59,941
to a substantially higher
function level.

348
00:11:59,943 --> 00:12:01,009
It makes people,
for a few hours,

349
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:04,112
a much better version
of themselves--

350
00:12:04,114 --> 00:12:05,447
their brains
more genius-like--

351
00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:07,148
works faster--
and so do their bodies.

352
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,751
If there is a memory
inside Bruce that can help us,

353
00:12:09,753 --> 00:12:11,219
it might help to give it

354
00:12:11,221 --> 00:12:14,589
a little... jolt.

355
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:16,658
I don't think Mr. Jones
is in any condition

356
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,993
for something like that.

357
00:12:17,995 --> 00:12:21,129
You look like my Aunt Philomena.

358
00:12:22,432 --> 00:12:23,698
Take me home.

359
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,101
What if one of us goes first,

360
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:27,669
to show you it's safe?

361
00:12:28,705 --> 00:12:30,205
Bruce, you are a patriot.

362
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,806
We're trying
to catch terrorists.

363
00:12:35,612 --> 00:12:37,345
Okay, great--
Toby, I'll go first.

364
00:12:38,348 --> 00:12:39,948
Hell, no.

365
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,983
Your neurons are packed
so densely,

366
00:12:41,985 --> 00:12:43,418
they could permanently fuse.

367
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,687
Then jump-start me.

368
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,124
This is effectively
experimental

369
00:12:49,126 --> 00:12:51,693
and definitely reckless,

370
00:12:51,695 --> 00:12:53,862
especially to someone in
Bruce's condition and to you.

371
00:12:53,864 --> 00:12:55,363
We have no choice.

372
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:57,899
There's a nuclear silo
under cyber-attack.

373
00:12:57,901 --> 00:13:00,902
Finding the football is
the only shot to stop a launch.

374
00:13:02,105 --> 00:13:03,939
So wire me up.

375
00:13:05,342 --> 00:13:06,775
Is that a car battery?

376
00:13:06,777 --> 00:13:09,644
It's AAA approved,
so if we kill you,

377
00:13:09,646 --> 00:13:11,513
you get a free tow
to the morgue.

378
00:13:11,515 --> 00:13:12,647
Okay,

379
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:14,049
these electrodes
will cause

380
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:17,686
your neurons' resting membrane
potential to depolarize,

381
00:13:17,688 --> 00:13:20,155
which allows for
spontaneous cell firing.

382
00:13:20,157 --> 00:13:23,792
In short, your brain
is gonna work better.

383
00:13:23,794 --> 00:13:25,727
Or not at all.

384
00:13:25,729 --> 00:13:28,997
All right, we're ready,
so here we go.

385
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:30,699
Happy?

386
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:32,968
I'm not turning this thing on.

387
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,103
It could end up being
a criminal act.

388
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,738
You're the mechanic.
You're the doctor.

389
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,706
Oh, for Pete's sake.

390
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,107
Remind me not to put you

391
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,308
in charge of my living will.

392
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,977
O-O-Okay.

393
00:13:41,979 --> 00:13:44,813
I am gonna turn you up...

394
00:13:44,815 --> 00:13:46,114
now.

395
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,916
Somebody should be saying
this is crazy, right?

396
00:13:47,918 --> 00:13:49,217
'Cause it is.

397
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:53,588
Gonna start you
at 500 milliamps.

398
00:13:54,691 --> 00:13:55,691
Yep, yep.

399
00:13:55,692 --> 00:13:56,658
Feel that.

400
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,226
Sorry.

401
00:13:58,228 --> 00:14:00,862
It was just a tingle,
it's all right.

402
00:14:00,864 --> 00:14:03,064
Now I'm gonna
charge you up to 1,200.

403
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,570
Okay, I think that's
been long enough.

404
00:14:08,572 --> 00:14:09,537
You okay?

405
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:11,106
Yeah, there's a buzzing
in my head,

406
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:13,675
and there's a taste
of metal in my mouth.

407
00:14:13,677 --> 00:14:15,176
Yeah, those are
normal side effects.

408
00:14:15,178 --> 00:14:16,611
Nothing normal about this.

409
00:14:16,613 --> 00:14:20,749
All right, I'm gonna
slowly dial you down now.

410
00:14:28,225 --> 00:14:29,557
Well, Bruce,

411
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:31,659
the good news is--

412
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:33,128
I'm alive.

413
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,197
The bad news is--
it didn't do anything.

414
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:38,366
Cabe, think fast.

415
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,174
Welcome to us.

416
00:14:46,175 --> 00:14:50,175

<i> You're wheeled</i>

419
00:14:55,544 --> 00:14:57,612
<i>Triage nurses are</i>
<i>barking orders.</i>

420
00:14:57,613 --> 00:14:59,046
One line of saline, wide open!

421
00:14:59,048 --> 00:15:01,114
Remove this case for me
so I can get the I.V. in.

422
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:03,750
<i>Then they remove the football</i>
<i>to run an arterial line.</i>

423
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,061
Little bit sluggish.
Let's get him on the monitor.

424
00:15:12,928 --> 00:15:14,261
Someone picked it up.

425
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,631
Hey, don't cut off
the juice, yet.

426
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:18,966
You're just starting
to see stuff.

427
00:15:18,968 --> 00:15:20,968
Any more than that in a
three-day period could be fatal,

428
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,569
especially for him.

429
00:15:22,571 --> 00:15:23,904
What exactly did you see?

430
00:15:23,906 --> 00:15:26,240
I saw a man...

431
00:15:26,242 --> 00:15:27,374
w-with a blue finger.

432
00:15:27,376 --> 00:15:28,976
Regular hand, b-but...

433
00:15:28,978 --> 00:15:30,844
one blue finger.

434
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,946
Like "my pen exploded
in my hand" blue,

435
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:34,214
or like Papa Smurf blue?

436
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:37,251
I don't know, Cupcake,
it was, uh, it was blue.

437
00:15:37,253 --> 00:15:38,285
Bluish.

438
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:39,920
I didn't see his face.

439
00:15:42,892 --> 00:15:45,025
There's too much
stuff coming at me.

440
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,294
What the hell
did you guys do to me?

441
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:53,367
Mapplethorpe?

442
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,035
Wait, uh, what's that
supposed to mean?

443
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:58,572
Was it... Was there
a Mapplethorpe print

444
00:15:58,574 --> 00:16:00,107
on the wall?
Near the thief?

445
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:01,308
I don't know.

446
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,409
I'm so confused.

447
00:16:02,411 --> 00:16:04,745
The procedure can cause
neural backfires,

448
00:16:04,747 --> 00:16:06,980
these quick memory flashes,
visuals, sounds--

449
00:16:06,982 --> 00:16:09,516
it might be more intense
for someone with your condition.

450
00:16:09,518 --> 00:16:11,118
Give it time.

451
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,921
Okay, leave him alone
for a beat.

452
00:16:13,923 --> 00:16:16,089
Why don't you come over here.

453
00:16:19,795 --> 00:16:22,396
What the hell does he mean,
a guy with one blue finger?

454
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,065
Well, it's probably
not a glove design.

455
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,034
It was 70 degrees the
day of the shooting.

456
00:16:27,036 --> 00:16:28,635
No one was wearing
hand gear.

457
00:16:28,637 --> 00:16:30,170
According to the report
Merrick showed us,

458
00:16:30,172 --> 00:16:31,471
there were eight
Kosovan bodyguards,

459
00:16:31,473 --> 00:16:33,674
eight Secret Service,
two presidents,

460
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:36,143
so almost 20 people
running around, diving.

461
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:37,811
So in the mad scramble
after the shooting,

462
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:39,112
someone might have hurt
their hand.

463
00:16:39,114 --> 00:16:41,481
A bruised or broken finger
could appear discolored.

464
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:43,450
We need to see the hospital
records from that day.

465
00:16:43,452 --> 00:16:44,952
If someone got
a busted finger

466
00:16:44,954 --> 00:16:46,954
and got medical treatment,
that's our guy.

467
00:16:46,956 --> 00:16:49,122
Since this was an OTR,
that would mean

468
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:51,658
all the hospital records
would have been confiscated

469
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,894
by the Feds, but we'd still
have copies at Homeland.

470
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:55,896
Paige, you stay here,
make sure he's okay.

471
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:57,297
Happy, you're the
toughest on the team.

472
00:16:57,299 --> 00:16:59,733
You hang back in case Bruce
gets worked up again.

473
00:16:59,735 --> 00:17:01,301
Let's go.

474
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:07,341
What, these are all
off-the-record maneuvers

475
00:17:07,343 --> 00:17:08,408
no one knows about?

476
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,743
We don't digitize it

477
00:17:09,745 --> 00:17:11,111
so guys like
you can hack in.

478
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,479
I hate government.

479
00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:14,181
Then don't cash your
federal paycheck.

480
00:17:14,183 --> 00:17:16,249
Knee fractures,
forearm abrasions,

481
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:19,019
head sutures, no hand injuries.

482
00:17:19,021 --> 00:17:20,654
Merrick texted.

483
00:17:20,656 --> 00:17:22,689
NORAD estimates that
the hackers will be in control

484
00:17:22,691 --> 00:17:24,891
of the silo's mainframe
in less than two hours.

485
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:25,826
Um, Cabe...

486
00:17:25,828 --> 00:17:27,260
if the hackers do end up

487
00:17:27,262 --> 00:17:28,595
launching, like,
a bunch of missiles,

488
00:17:28,597 --> 00:17:30,197
will we, you know,
get a heads up?

489
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:31,932
Because I got to figure
that L.A. is a target,

490
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:33,734
and I would not fare well
in an apocalypse.

491
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:35,235
This is weird.

492
00:17:35,237 --> 00:17:36,937
Secret Service Agent
Khara was given

493
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:39,072
nitroglycerin for
a preexisting heart condition

494
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:41,241
aggravated
by the shooting incident.

495
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:43,310
Yeah, that's protocol
for cardiac episodes.

496
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,678
Yes, but people with heart
conditions can't be

497
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,680
in the Secret Service,
so why'd he lie to his doctor?

498
00:17:46,682 --> 00:17:48,849
Think I know.
Where you going?

499
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:50,751
I can find out if Agent
Khara's our thief.

500
00:17:50,753 --> 00:17:52,319
I just need a bucket
of ice water.

501
00:17:53,956 --> 00:17:55,288
So what's it take for a guy

502
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,957
to get something
to eat around here?

503
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:01,561
Thanks, honey.

504
00:18:01,563 --> 00:18:03,897
I know he's sick, but if
he calls me "honey" again,

505
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:05,265
I am gonna clock him.

506
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:07,234
Take a breath.

507
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:09,136
You and, uh, Drew are
moving to Portland?

508
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:11,805
Toby eavesdropped again.

509
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,610
No opinion on the matter?

510
00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:19,413
Well, Portland's cold.

511
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:20,714
That i...

512
00:18:20,716 --> 00:18:23,417
Th-That is the same useless
information Walter gave me.

513
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:25,519
Okay, facts
aren't useless.

514
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,454
They're the foundation
of rational thought.

515
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:29,990
And I think Ralph
will be bored there.

516
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:33,326
Uh, well, you know,
I think...

517
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:35,295
I think you geniuses
hide behind

518
00:18:35,297 --> 00:18:36,963
a pile of facts and figures

519
00:18:36,965 --> 00:18:38,598
when you don't want
to engage in something...

520
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,069
unpleasant, like the idea
of Ralph and me leaving.

521
00:18:42,071 --> 00:18:44,838
The more something
bothers or scares you,

522
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,040
the more you hide
behind data.

523
00:18:48,944 --> 00:18:50,210
Your sandwich is ready.

524
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,312
Good talk.

525
00:18:53,148 --> 00:18:54,681
Bruce?

526
00:18:55,284 --> 00:18:57,017
Bruce...?

527
00:18:59,021 --> 00:19:01,021
Uh, Happy...

528
00:19:01,023 --> 00:19:02,789
we may have a problem.

529
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,257
What's going on?

530
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:05,759
He's gone.

531
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:07,127
You lost him?

532
00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:08,929
I was making a sandwich.

533
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,699
Where is this guy?
I gotta go.

534
00:19:12,701 --> 00:19:13,767
What?!

535
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:15,235
Go where?

536
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,269
Dodge City, Kansas.

537
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:17,904
To the bathroom.
I got my hand in ice water.

538
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,307
That only works
with warm water.

539
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:23,243
I'm about to disprove that myth
all over your leather interior.

540
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,245
Homeland tracked the guy's
cell to this block.

541
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,747
He'll turn up soon,
just be patient.

542
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:28,615
Wow.

543
00:19:28,617 --> 00:19:31,118
Colors are so vibrant.

544
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,552
That's because the
recharge we gave you

545
00:19:32,554 --> 00:19:35,222
has the electrical impulses
hitting the visual cortex

546
00:19:35,224 --> 00:19:37,791
of your brain faster
than it has in decades.

547
00:19:37,793 --> 00:19:40,127
Oh. Oh, oh, oh,
there he is, there he is.

548
00:19:40,696 --> 00:19:42,129
Hey, hold this.

549
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:45,699
Hey, Nalin!

550
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:47,434
Nalin Khara, right?

551
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,336
Hey, it's Tobias Curtis.

552
00:19:49,338 --> 00:19:51,304
I worked with your brother
back in DC.

553
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:52,639
Hi.
Hey.

554
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:53,974
What are you doing?

555
00:19:53,976 --> 00:19:55,609
I'm dropping
your hand temperature.

556
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,710
Let go.
No...

557
00:19:56,712 --> 00:19:58,512
Let go of my hand. - No.
Let go of my hand!

558
00:19:58,514 --> 00:20:00,547
Cabe! Cabe!
Let go of my hand!

559
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:02,516
Agent Gallo, Homeland Security.

560
00:20:02,518 --> 00:20:04,217
Let this man hold your hand.

561
00:20:04,219 --> 00:20:05,652
What the hell?

562
00:20:05,654 --> 00:20:07,534
Don't worry, it doesn't mean
we're going steady.

563
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,256
And...

564
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:10,524
Oop, we're done.

565
00:20:10,526 --> 00:20:11,925
What's wrong with you, man?

566
00:20:11,927 --> 00:20:13,593
More like,
what's wrong with you?

567
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:14,861
You got Raynaud's
phenomenon.

568
00:20:14,863 --> 00:20:17,697
Vessel spasms that constrict
blood flow to a digit,

569
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:19,199
creating that blue hue...

570
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:21,568
that's triggered by direct cold
and stressful situations.

571
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,870
Like stealing a very
important briefcase.

572
00:20:23,872 --> 00:20:26,940
Your condition was set off,
you got some nitroglycerin,

573
00:20:26,942 --> 00:20:28,708
and then you stole
the football.

574
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,843
We caught you, pal.

575
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:31,778
Blue-handed.
Seriously?

576
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,780
Been waiting an hour
to say that, Sly, shut up.

577
00:20:33,782 --> 00:20:35,715
Okay, I will tell
you everything.

578
00:20:35,717 --> 00:20:37,250
But you need to understand...

579
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:38,285
Hey, hey, hey!

580
00:20:41,857 --> 00:20:43,957
Holy friggin' crap.

581
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:46,193
His motor neurons are firing
on all cylinders from the juice.

582
00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:47,794
It's like he's 25 again.

583
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:58,605
Whatever you did to my brain...

584
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:00,373
it worked.

585
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:10,419
Question I keep
going back to is:

586
00:21:10,422 --> 00:21:12,623
why would
a Secret Service agent

587
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:13,857
with a perfect record

588
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:15,726
steal the football?

589
00:21:22,868 --> 00:21:25,235
So, I did some digging
into someone

590
00:21:25,237 --> 00:21:27,604
we never even considered
16 years ago.

591
00:21:27,606 --> 00:21:31,141
At the time of the
assassination attempt,

592
00:21:31,143 --> 00:21:33,710
you still had
family in Pakistan:

593
00:21:33,712 --> 00:21:36,914
grandmother, two uncles,
despite having no priors,

594
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,983
were locked up
as political dissidents

595
00:21:39,985 --> 00:21:41,251
and facing death.

596
00:21:41,253 --> 00:21:44,154
Then, in the months after
the football went missing,

597
00:21:44,156 --> 00:21:45,389
charges were dropped.

598
00:21:45,391 --> 00:21:48,292
Someone found the weakness

599
00:21:48,294 --> 00:21:50,894
in a Secret Service agent,

600
00:21:50,896 --> 00:21:52,496
targeted you,

601
00:21:52,498 --> 00:21:54,765
and made you do their bidding.

602
00:21:56,769 --> 00:21:58,669
Am I missing anything?

603
00:21:59,905 --> 00:22:01,205
I've got the Pentagon

604
00:22:01,207 --> 00:22:03,106
breathing down my
neck for updates,

605
00:22:03,108 --> 00:22:05,642
and the only lead we got to stop
nuclear winter isn't talking.

606
00:22:05,644 --> 00:22:07,845
And he won't.
He's motivated to protect his family.

607
00:22:07,847 --> 00:22:09,213
If whoever's
behind these attacks

608
00:22:09,215 --> 00:22:11,114
finds out he cooperated,
they're dead.

609
00:22:11,116 --> 00:22:13,317
I need you to dig into
your bag of tricks, Walter.

610
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:15,252
We need to find
a way to crack him.

611
00:22:16,255 --> 00:22:17,821
No luck at the pizza place.

612
00:22:17,823 --> 00:22:18,823
You?

613
00:22:18,824 --> 00:22:20,090
Zilch.

614
00:22:20,092 --> 00:22:21,859
Where do you go if
you're a former agent

615
00:22:21,861 --> 00:22:23,560
who just got his
brain blasted?

616
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:32,336
Hey, Walt.

617
00:22:32,338 --> 00:22:33,704
Bruce?

618
00:22:33,706 --> 00:22:35,772
Yeah, get him together and
meet us at Whitehull Hospital.

619
00:22:35,774 --> 00:22:38,175
- I have an idea. And hurry.
- Okay.

620
00:22:38,177 --> 00:22:40,611
You didn't tell him
about Bruce.

621
00:22:40,613 --> 00:22:42,880
I kind of want
to keep my job.

622
00:22:42,882 --> 00:22:44,281
We're screwed.

623
00:22:48,587 --> 00:22:50,254
This realty sign...

624
00:22:50,256 --> 00:22:51,555
"17 Maplethorpe Road."

625
00:22:51,557 --> 00:22:52,723
Isn't Maplethorpe...?

626
00:22:52,725 --> 00:22:54,258
What Bruce was mumbling about
after we juiced him.

627
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,259
He wasn't talking about art,

628
00:22:55,261 --> 00:22:56,994
he was telling us
where he wanted to go.

629
00:22:56,996 --> 00:22:57,996
I'll drive!

630
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,303
That was terrifying.

631
00:23:06,305 --> 00:23:08,572
I'm never letting you
drive my car again.

632
00:23:08,574 --> 00:23:10,007
I found him, didn't I?

633
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:10,941
What the hell...?

634
00:23:10,943 --> 00:23:12,409
Already told you, sir.

635
00:23:12,411 --> 00:23:13,844
No one named Lorraine
lives here.

636
00:23:13,846 --> 00:23:14,945
Hey...
It's okay.

637
00:23:14,947 --> 00:23:16,947
He's with us.
Take your damn hands off me.

638
00:23:16,949 --> 00:23:17,949
It's all right, Bruce.

639
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,117
Let's take a walk
and get a breath.

640
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:21,518
Look, he means no harm.

641
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,553
He just doesn't know where he is
sometimes-- he's sick.

642
00:23:23,555 --> 00:23:26,890
I'm not sick
at all... right now.

643
00:23:26,892 --> 00:23:29,026
I just thought
she'd be here, that's all.

644
00:23:29,028 --> 00:23:31,695
That's why you duped us
and ran away?

645
00:23:31,697 --> 00:23:32,930
To see a girl?

646
00:23:32,932 --> 00:23:34,631
It's none of your
damn business.

647
00:23:34,633 --> 00:23:35,799
Doesn't matter, anyway.

648
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:37,601
She's gone... again.

649
00:23:37,603 --> 00:23:39,736
Who?

650
00:23:39,738 --> 00:23:43,006
Look, I'm grateful
that I got my mind back, okay?

651
00:23:43,008 --> 00:23:45,375
Short-lived though it may be.

652
00:23:45,377 --> 00:23:48,578
I just wish some of my memories
had stayed gone, I guess.

653
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,546
Which memories?

654
00:23:49,548 --> 00:23:50,847
Who were you looking for here?

655
00:23:50,849 --> 00:23:53,050
Her name is Lorraine.

656
00:23:54,353 --> 00:23:56,887
She was
a White House secretary.

657
00:23:56,889 --> 00:23:59,089
I liked her.

658
00:24:01,026 --> 00:24:02,192
I loved her.

659
00:24:03,829 --> 00:24:06,530
I didn't want her to see me
become what I am,

660
00:24:06,532 --> 00:24:08,665
so I... I asked 'em

661
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:11,001
if I could take my treatment
out here in Los Angeles,

662
00:24:11,003 --> 00:24:12,502
and I, uh...

663
00:24:12,504 --> 00:24:15,005
I left without saying a word.

664
00:24:15,007 --> 00:24:17,407
I heard she moved out
here some time back.

665
00:24:17,409 --> 00:24:18,842
I never checked
up, but, uh...

666
00:24:18,844 --> 00:24:23,880
now that some of my memories
are coming back...

667
00:24:23,882 --> 00:24:28,218
it's like it's happening
to me all over again.

668
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,455
It's as... painful
as it was the first time.

669
00:24:33,525 --> 00:24:35,826
Just take me home, okay?
Please?

670
00:24:37,763 --> 00:24:40,564
About that...

671
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:42,566
The magnetoencephalography
machine

672
00:24:42,568 --> 00:24:44,368
will map when your
memories are activated.

673
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,802
Almost set.

674
00:24:45,804 --> 00:24:48,005
Can you guys tell me
what the emergency is?

675
00:24:48,007 --> 00:24:50,107
Like, um, is this guy
a spy or something?

676
00:24:50,109 --> 00:24:52,209
That's need-to-know.

677
00:24:55,047 --> 00:24:57,447
Y-You know, this-this
isn't going to work, guys.

678
00:24:57,449 --> 00:24:59,916
I've already told you
everything I can recall.

679
00:24:59,918 --> 00:25:01,852
No, I know, but sometimes

680
00:25:01,854 --> 00:25:04,287
memories can be awoken
with the proper stimulant.

681
00:25:04,289 --> 00:25:06,590
All right,
tell me, Bruce,

682
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:08,392
do you recognize
this guy?

683
00:25:09,661 --> 00:25:10,894
No.

684
00:25:11,764 --> 00:25:13,597
Take a closer look...

685
00:25:14,433 --> 00:25:15,433
...and try aging him down

686
00:25:15,434 --> 00:25:17,634
about 16 years.

687
00:25:18,737 --> 00:25:19,936
Khara?

688
00:25:19,938 --> 00:25:22,439
Is that you?

689
00:25:23,475 --> 00:25:25,976
I don't remember
the last time I saw you.

690
00:25:27,646 --> 00:25:30,380
The last time you saw him...

691
00:25:30,382 --> 00:25:32,916
was when he stole
the football, Bruce.

692
00:25:35,554 --> 00:25:38,155
You son of a bitch.

693
00:25:38,157 --> 00:25:40,090
You took it
all from me.

694
00:25:40,092 --> 00:25:43,226
You took my career,

695
00:25:43,228 --> 00:25:45,529
you took my life!

696
00:25:45,531 --> 00:25:46,696
You took her!

697
00:25:46,698 --> 00:25:48,365
Focus on his hand, Bruce.

698
00:25:48,367 --> 00:25:51,034
Focus-- allow your memories
of that day to return.

699
00:25:51,036 --> 00:25:52,235
You're in the hospital,

700
00:25:52,237 --> 00:25:53,937
you're getting
prepped for surgery...

701
00:25:53,939 --> 00:25:55,038
One line of saline, wide open!

702
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,206
GSW to the torso!

703
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:58,341
Then a hand reached down
and took that case.

704
00:26:01,213 --> 00:26:02,379
It was Khara.

705
00:26:02,381 --> 00:26:03,980
You saw him.

706
00:26:03,982 --> 00:26:05,282
What happens now?

707
00:26:05,284 --> 00:26:07,084
GSW to the torso!

708
00:26:08,687 --> 00:26:10,420
I don't know.

709
00:26:10,422 --> 00:26:12,222
Uh, y-yes, you do.

710
00:26:12,224 --> 00:26:13,290
It's in there, Bruce.

711
00:26:13,292 --> 00:26:16,693
He's not gonna tell us,
so you need to.

712
00:26:16,695 --> 00:26:18,628
I can't... I can't remember.
I'm sorry.

713
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,363
The man doesn't know anything.

714
00:26:20,365 --> 00:26:21,898
Just let him be and move on.

715
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,834
There's nothing
any of us can do now.

716
00:26:23,836 --> 00:26:25,368
It's done.

717
00:26:26,138 --> 00:26:27,138
It's done.

718
00:26:27,139 --> 00:26:28,505
What did you just say?

719
00:26:29,441 --> 00:26:30,340
Bingo.

720
00:26:30,342 --> 00:26:32,209
Okay, talk to me, Bruce.

721
00:26:32,211 --> 00:26:33,543
Tell me, what did
you remember?

722
00:26:33,545 --> 00:26:35,145
<i>GSW to the torso!</i>

723
00:26:35,147 --> 00:26:36,847
Little bit sluggish.
Let's get him on the monitor.

724
00:26:36,849 --> 00:26:38,582
He was leaving...

725
00:26:40,018 --> 00:26:41,284
<i>...then he called someone.</i>

726
00:26:41,286 --> 00:26:42,786
I heard him.

727
00:26:44,289 --> 00:26:45,589
It's done.

728
00:26:45,591 --> 00:26:47,324
Come on, focus, Bruce.
What did you hear?

729
00:26:47,326 --> 00:26:48,758
I heard sounds.

730
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,093
Uh-uh... tones.

731
00:26:50,095 --> 00:26:51,828
Like tones from dialing a phone?

732
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,196
I think so.

733
00:26:53,999 --> 00:26:55,398
Okay, hold that thought!

734
00:26:57,769 --> 00:27:02,939
Bruce heard Khara place a call
to his conspirator... then,

735
00:27:02,941 --> 00:27:04,107
all we need to do

736
00:27:04,109 --> 00:27:05,442
is reverse engineer
the number he dialed

737
00:27:05,444 --> 00:27:07,811
and that should lead us
to whoever has the case.

738
00:27:07,813 --> 00:27:09,412
How can you
possibly identify

739
00:27:09,414 --> 00:27:12,582
push-button tones
16 years later?

740
00:27:12,584 --> 00:27:14,985
His memory's tucked away
in a cranial fold somewhere.

741
00:27:14,987 --> 00:27:16,820
Everything you read,
see, or hear--

742
00:27:16,822 --> 00:27:18,622
it's stored away,
like in a computer,

743
00:27:18,624 --> 00:27:20,423
and we just need to
access that file.

744
00:27:20,425 --> 00:27:23,059
Is all of this really necessary?

745
00:27:23,061 --> 00:27:24,294
Sensory recreation stimuli

746
00:27:24,296 --> 00:27:26,496
to get you back to
the exact place you were

747
00:27:26,498 --> 00:27:28,198
where the football was stolen.

748
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,200
Similar suit
to what you were wearing,

749
00:27:30,202 --> 00:27:32,202
hospital Muzak...

750
00:27:32,204 --> 00:27:34,204
- What the hell?
- Oh, it's iodine.

751
00:27:34,206 --> 00:27:36,273
They used this
to prep you for surgery.

752
00:27:36,275 --> 00:27:38,308
The olfactory sense is
the strongest memory trigger.

753
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,243
Since we juiced you,
your temporal lobe

754
00:27:40,245 --> 00:27:41,878
has just been itching
to reminisce with us.

755
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,013
We just gotta goose it.

756
00:27:43,015 --> 00:27:44,648
So, Bruce, close your eyes,

757
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,116
exhale...

758
00:27:48,187 --> 00:27:49,686
...focus.

759
00:27:49,688 --> 00:27:51,755
Assume Khara dialed local.

760
00:27:51,757 --> 00:27:54,157
Cell phones weren't prevalent
16 years ago,

761
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,725
and he wasn't gonna
overnight the football, so...

762
00:27:55,727 --> 00:27:59,663
the most popular area codes
in L.A. at the time were

763
00:27:59,665 --> 00:28:04,534
323, 310, and 213.

764
00:28:09,374 --> 00:28:11,274
<i>GSW to the torso!</i>

765
00:28:11,276 --> 00:28:13,243
Little bit sluggish.
Let's get him on the monitor.

766
00:28:13,245 --> 00:28:15,378
Any of those sound familiar?

767
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,913
The first one.

768
00:28:16,915 --> 00:28:18,148
323 it is.

769
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,517
Seven more
mystery numbers to go.

770
00:28:21,486 --> 00:28:23,119
No.

771
00:28:23,121 --> 00:28:26,623
<i> Concentrate on</i>
<i>his phone... just the phone.</i>

772
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:27,924
- GSW to the torso.
- ...little bit sluggish.

773
00:28:27,926 --> 00:28:29,292
Let's get him on the monitor.

774
00:28:29,294 --> 00:28:30,527
Yes.

775
00:28:34,132 --> 00:28:35,132
Yes.

776
00:28:36,368 --> 00:28:37,701
That one.

777
00:28:39,004 --> 00:28:41,071
No...

778
00:28:41,073 --> 00:28:42,439
Yes.

779
00:28:42,441 --> 00:28:45,508
323-248-8049.

780
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,776
We got it!

781
00:28:46,778 --> 00:28:48,111
We just gotta find
out who that number

782
00:28:48,113 --> 00:28:49,113
belonged to 16 years ago.

783
00:28:49,114 --> 00:28:51,481
I'm working on it.

784
00:28:51,483 --> 00:28:52,983
Update!

785
00:28:52,985 --> 00:28:56,253
Hackers are into
the Icelandic silo.

786
00:28:56,255 --> 00:28:57,887
The nuclear
launch sequence

787
00:28:57,889 --> 00:28:59,556
has been activated for a missile

788
00:28:59,558 --> 00:29:01,524
aimed at St. Petersburg, Russia.

789
00:29:01,526 --> 00:29:04,194
<i>Right now, personnel</i>
<i>are doing all they can</i>

790
00:29:04,196 --> 00:29:05,862
<i>to stop the missiles.</i>
<i>They will fail.</i>

791
00:29:05,864 --> 00:29:07,063
<i>How long do we have?</i>

792
00:29:07,065 --> 00:29:09,666
T-minus 30
until ready for launch.

793
00:29:16,165 --> 00:29:18,551
So, in 30 minutes,
all the terrorists need to do

794
00:29:18,552 --> 00:29:20,552
is push a button in a briefcase?

795
00:29:20,554 --> 00:29:21,620
Why Russia?
What's the endgame?

796
00:29:21,622 --> 00:29:24,322
It's logical. It's brilliant.
For decades,

797
00:29:24,324 --> 00:29:25,524
terrorists
have been fighting us,

798
00:29:25,526 --> 00:29:26,591
getting knocked down,
rebuilding,

799
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:27,626
then coming back at us.

800
00:29:27,628 --> 00:29:30,696
But if a U.S. nuke
hits a Russian city--

801
00:29:30,698 --> 00:29:32,531
they're gonna sit back

802
00:29:32,533 --> 00:29:33,865
and watch us destroy each other.

803
00:29:33,867 --> 00:29:35,434
There's only one way
to fix this.

804
00:29:35,436 --> 00:29:37,102
Stop the bastards from
ever pushing that button.

805
00:29:37,104 --> 00:29:39,371
To do that, we need to know
what that phone number leads to.

806
00:29:39,373 --> 00:29:42,574
Got it! It belongs to
a defunct non-profit

807
00:29:42,576 --> 00:29:45,711
that takes care of poor
Middle Eastern children.

808
00:29:45,713 --> 00:29:47,946
Well, it's not the first time
that a fake charity

809
00:29:47,948 --> 00:29:50,248
has been used to launder money
for a terrorist group.

810
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:52,451
This one's headed up
by one Nadim Gadhi.

811
00:29:52,453 --> 00:29:53,819
Last known address?

812
00:29:53,821 --> 00:29:56,021
He's in a boathouse
at the harbor.

813
00:29:56,023 --> 00:29:57,756
19 minutes away.
By the time we arrive,

814
00:29:57,758 --> 00:29:58,924
we'll only have nine minutes

815
00:29:58,926 --> 00:30:01,226
until the nukes are ready to go.
We gotta move!

816
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,269
Cops are a few minutes out.

817
00:30:11,271 --> 00:30:12,571
Walter, Bruce-- need you.

818
00:30:12,573 --> 00:30:14,072
Toby, need you

819
00:30:14,074 --> 00:30:15,574
in case Bruce has any issues.

820
00:30:15,576 --> 00:30:16,942
The rest of you,
remain alert.

821
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,567
You're the one who wanted me
to keep my phone on.

822
00:30:47,975 --> 00:30:50,642
Homeland! Freeze!

823
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:53,979
You all right?
Fine. Let's go.

824
00:31:06,026 --> 00:31:07,859
Game on!

825
00:31:07,861 --> 00:31:08,860
Oh, God, she's driving again.

826
00:31:08,862 --> 00:31:10,195
Happy, I'm not buckled.
Just wait!

827
00:31:10,197 --> 00:31:11,263
Wait till I'm buckled!
I'm not buckled!

828
00:31:11,265 --> 00:31:13,098
<i>Happy, Happy, Happy!</i>
<i>Safety first!</i>

829
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,133
<i>What did we talk about?</i>

830
00:31:40,194 --> 00:31:42,594
If we split up,
we cover more ground.

831
00:31:42,596 --> 00:31:44,796
All right.
Okay.

832
00:32:22,836 --> 00:32:24,135
Walter, you all right?

833
00:32:24,137 --> 00:32:26,271
We got less than two minutes.
We gotta get that case.

834
00:32:33,814 --> 00:32:36,314
Homeland! Freeze!

835
00:32:36,316 --> 00:32:38,984
Drop your weapon!
Drop your weapon!

836
00:32:41,388 --> 00:32:42,487
Put down the case.

837
00:32:42,489 --> 00:32:44,656
Set down the case
and step away from it!

838
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:57,949
Put down the case
and step away from it!

839
00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:04,569
No! No!

840
00:33:04,571 --> 00:33:06,772
Toby, stop! It's electrified!

841
00:33:06,774 --> 00:33:08,340
Best thing about America?

842
00:33:08,342 --> 00:33:10,976
The trains always run on time.

843
00:33:14,248 --> 00:33:16,214
In less than a minute,
those nukes are ready to launch.

844
00:33:16,216 --> 00:33:18,283
If that train runs over the
case, the button will depress.

845
00:33:18,285 --> 00:33:19,651
And millions will die.

846
00:33:21,989 --> 00:33:23,355
All right,
the fence is electrified.

847
00:33:23,357 --> 00:33:24,523
We can't climb it.

848
00:33:24,525 --> 00:33:26,058
Happy, where's
the nearest junction box?

849
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,326
It's on the other side
of the yard.

850
00:33:27,328 --> 00:33:28,493
I'll never get there in time.

851
00:33:28,495 --> 00:33:29,928
It's a quarter mile down
and around the fence.

852
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,229
Normally, it would take
less than two minutes

853
00:33:31,231 --> 00:33:33,098
to get down there, but due to
the speed of the train,

854
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,866
we only have 45 seconds, Walter!

855
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,742
I've got an idea!

856
00:33:43,744 --> 00:33:45,210
What are you doing?
There's no way

857
00:33:45,212 --> 00:33:47,312
that magnet's strong enough
to stop that train!

858
00:33:47,314 --> 00:33:50,248
And that case is aluminum,
it's not magnetic!

859
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:52,150
Of course! The track is
lined with intermittent

860
00:33:52,152 --> 00:33:54,920
shoe brakes that'll stop the
train in case of an emergency.

861
00:33:54,922 --> 00:33:57,556
It's activated
by electromagnetic coils.

862
00:33:57,558 --> 00:33:59,057
She's using the magnet
to reverse polarities

863
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:00,525
and flip the switch!

864
00:34:20,948 --> 00:34:22,681
Time's up-- missiles
are ready for launch!

865
00:34:35,462 --> 00:34:37,863
Uh...

866
00:34:37,865 --> 00:34:39,030
You did it!

867
00:34:45,873 --> 00:34:48,673
The launch sequence has been
shut down and the feds

868
00:34:48,675 --> 00:34:51,042
have tracked Gadhi's
online communications.

869
00:34:51,044 --> 00:34:53,879
Interpol's picking up his
pals overseas as we speak.

870
00:34:53,881 --> 00:34:55,547
Feel free to take a bow.

871
00:34:55,549 --> 00:34:57,549
You all just saved the world.

872
00:34:58,452 --> 00:35:00,652
And you took me
out of the line of fire

873
00:35:00,654 --> 00:35:01,853
like I was POTUS.

874
00:35:03,023 --> 00:35:05,657
You're still a
hell of an agent.

875
00:35:05,659 --> 00:35:09,027
My orders are
to dispose of this.

876
00:35:09,029 --> 00:35:12,063
And we are to act
like this never happened.

877
00:35:12,065 --> 00:35:13,065
OTR.

878
00:35:13,066 --> 00:35:15,167
O... T... R.

879
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,373
Do the honors.

880
00:35:30,951 --> 00:35:32,984
I've been tough on you.

881
00:35:32,986 --> 00:35:33,986
Go get 'em.

882
00:35:33,987 --> 00:35:35,220
Let's see what you got.

883
00:35:35,222 --> 00:35:37,622
Okay-okay, okay.
Yeah!

884
00:35:37,624 --> 00:35:39,825
Okay.

885
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:43,829
Okay...

886
00:35:46,433 --> 00:35:47,499
That's it. Mm-hmm.

887
00:35:50,304 --> 00:35:51,870
That felt good.

888
00:35:51,872 --> 00:35:53,839
Sexy man!

889
00:35:53,841 --> 00:35:55,740
All right, let's
pack it up and head home.

890
00:35:55,742 --> 00:35:57,909
Shotgun.

891
00:36:01,248 --> 00:36:02,781
Come on.

892
00:36:02,783 --> 00:36:04,115
You were
pretty incredible today.

893
00:36:04,117 --> 00:36:06,952
Only because you
juiced my brain.

894
00:36:06,954 --> 00:36:09,054
You know, I work out,

895
00:36:09,056 --> 00:36:10,455
try to take care of myself.

896
00:36:10,457 --> 00:36:12,657
It never crosses my mind
I'm getting older.

897
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:14,960
But you never know how far
you slipped down that mountain

898
00:36:14,962 --> 00:36:17,462
till you look back up and
see where you once were.

899
00:36:17,464 --> 00:36:19,531
Enjoy your youth
while you can, kid.

900
00:36:19,533 --> 00:36:21,867
One day you'll blink...

901
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:23,768
you'll be me.

902
00:36:25,305 --> 00:36:27,405
You know, I hate to spoil

903
00:36:27,407 --> 00:36:29,407
your moment of self-reflection,

904
00:36:29,409 --> 00:36:32,844
but what we did to you
wore off hours ago.

905
00:36:32,846 --> 00:36:35,347
Your heroics out here--

906
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:36,848
that was all you.

907
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,683
You don't say.

908
00:36:54,668 --> 00:36:57,035
I protected the
president once.

909
00:36:57,037 --> 00:36:59,437
Thank you for allowing me

910
00:36:59,439 --> 00:37:01,473
to feel useful again.

911
00:37:01,475 --> 00:37:03,875
I wish I could say
I wouldn't forget it, but, uh...

912
00:37:03,877 --> 00:37:06,044
There's advancements in
neurological science every year.

913
00:37:06,046 --> 00:37:07,178
You never know.

914
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,613
Yes, I do.

915
00:37:08,615 --> 00:37:10,215
And so do you.

916
00:37:11,652 --> 00:37:14,185
Make as many great
memories as you can.

917
00:37:14,187 --> 00:37:16,021
'Cause at the end of the day,

918
00:37:16,023 --> 00:37:18,690
we don't get to decide
the ones we keep, huh?

919
00:37:29,136 --> 00:37:32,003
Lorraine?!

920
00:37:32,005 --> 00:37:33,972
H-How did you...?

921
00:37:33,974 --> 00:37:36,775
We just found
a terrorist after 16 years.

922
00:37:36,777 --> 00:37:39,110
We can find a secretary.

923
00:37:39,112 --> 00:37:40,912
She's a strong memory in you.

924
00:37:40,914 --> 00:37:42,581
Maybe having her back
in your life

925
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:45,550
will help you hold on
a little more.

926
00:37:45,552 --> 00:37:48,353
Well, I'm gonna try.

927
00:37:49,389 --> 00:37:51,523
I'm gonna try like hell.

928
00:38:20,621 --> 00:38:24,022
How about we hold off
cleaning until tomorrow, huh?

929
00:38:24,024 --> 00:38:25,757
I second that motion.

930
00:38:25,759 --> 00:38:27,792
Hear, hear.

931
00:38:29,429 --> 00:38:31,630
Thanks.

932
00:38:33,133 --> 00:38:34,866
Crazy day, huh?

933
00:38:34,868 --> 00:38:38,269
Crazy seems to be the norm.

934
00:38:38,271 --> 00:38:40,905
That's an astute observation.

935
00:38:40,907 --> 00:38:43,041
I, um... my assessment

936
00:38:43,043 --> 00:38:45,377
of Portland, uh, was, um,

937
00:38:45,379 --> 00:38:49,347
not the proper response
for your query.

938
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:50,281
Oh.

939
00:38:50,283 --> 00:38:52,584
Okay.

940
00:38:52,586 --> 00:38:55,286
Yeah, I thought it might also
be useful for you to know that

941
00:38:55,288 --> 00:38:57,789
the University of
Southern Maine also has,

942
00:38:57,791 --> 00:39:01,226
um, solid research facilities--

943
00:39:01,228 --> 00:39:03,795
not like UCLA, but solid--

944
00:39:03,797 --> 00:39:05,296
so it might be good for Ralph.

945
00:39:05,298 --> 00:39:08,233
Also they have
oceanography clubs for minors.

946
00:39:08,235 --> 00:39:10,735
Uh, average snowfall
is 61 inches.

947
00:39:10,737 --> 00:39:12,270
There are over 3,000...

948
00:39:12,272 --> 00:39:15,306
uh, islands off the coast,
so Ralph could explore,

949
00:39:15,308 --> 00:39:18,376
and-and-and it also brings in
90% of the nation's lobster,

950
00:39:18,378 --> 00:39:20,078
so, you know, crustaceans--
I'm sorry. Is this...

951
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,147
...funny?

952
00:39:22,149 --> 00:39:26,518
No. It's just a lot
of facts and figures.

953
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,220
Of course.
I care about giving you

954
00:39:29,222 --> 00:39:31,456
a complete answer
to your question.

955
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:33,324
Oh, I know.

956
00:39:33,326 --> 00:39:35,460
I know you care.

957
00:39:38,465 --> 00:39:40,465
No. You know,
I, um, I care about, um,

958
00:39:40,467 --> 00:39:44,002
more than just
you having the,

959
00:39:44,004 --> 00:39:46,638
um, the facts and-and...

960
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,108
full statistics for Ralph.
I, um...

961
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:52,043
I care about Ralph.

962
00:39:52,045 --> 00:39:54,079
You were right.

963
00:39:54,081 --> 00:39:55,146
I don't,

964
00:39:55,148 --> 00:39:57,549
um, I never had a real

965
00:39:57,551 --> 00:39:58,950
relationship with my father.

966
00:39:58,952 --> 00:40:00,852
And I know I'm not Ralph's,

967
00:40:00,854 --> 00:40:03,354
but I-I must serve...

968
00:40:03,356 --> 00:40:05,757
a purpose in his life,
because he serves

969
00:40:05,759 --> 00:40:08,893
such an important, uh,
one in mine,

970
00:40:08,895 --> 00:40:11,396
and if he left, then, uh...

971
00:40:11,398 --> 00:40:14,199
I-I know I said

972
00:40:14,201 --> 00:40:16,367
being human wasn't

973
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:18,203
something I wanted.

974
00:40:18,205 --> 00:40:20,205
But since I met your son,

975
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:22,440
I know that's
not entirely true.

976
00:40:22,442 --> 00:40:25,944
These last few months,
I've been... less me.

977
00:40:25,946 --> 00:40:28,513
And that's made me
a better person.

978
00:40:30,183 --> 00:40:32,283
So, no, I don't
want him to leave.

979
00:40:35,088 --> 00:40:37,822
I, uh...

980
00:40:37,824 --> 00:40:39,357
care about him.

981
00:40:41,228 --> 00:40:43,027
And you.

982
00:40:45,332 --> 00:40:47,232
Those are the last facts
that I have to say.

983
00:40:47,234 --> 00:40:49,434
And, well, yeah, so, okay.

984
00:40:49,436 --> 00:40:52,003
Walter?

985
00:40:52,005 --> 00:40:53,872
Yeah?

986
00:40:56,409 --> 00:40:58,376
I'd miss you, too.

987
00:40:59,946 --> 00:41:01,513
Hey!

988
00:41:01,515 --> 00:41:03,515
Look, Mom. Check it out!

989
00:41:03,517 --> 00:41:05,083
Guess who won the science fair.

990
00:41:05,085 --> 00:41:07,519
No way!

991
00:41:07,521 --> 00:41:08,887
That's incredible!

992
00:41:08,889 --> 00:41:10,054
And guess what.

993
00:41:10,056 --> 00:41:12,090
Billy from class
asked me to his birthday.

994
00:41:12,092 --> 00:41:13,258
Can I go?

995
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,794
You were invited to a party?

996
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:18,530
Of course you can go.

997
00:41:18,532 --> 00:41:21,599
Hey, what do you say
we give this engine a kick?

998
00:41:21,601 --> 00:41:23,968
I mean... unless you're
in a rush to go?

999
00:41:25,254 --> 00:41:26,654
No.

1000
00:41:26,655 --> 00:41:28,755
No, I don't want to go.

1001
00:41:31,426 --> 00:41:34,494
Okay, let's go.

1002
00:41:46,315 --> 00:41:52,815
