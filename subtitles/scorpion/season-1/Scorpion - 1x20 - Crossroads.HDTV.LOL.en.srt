for the witness

163
00:06:51,068 --> 00:06:53,570
from L.A. to Ventura. Sly?

164
00:06:53,572 --> 00:06:55,506
We suggest

165
00:06:55,508 --> 00:06:58,442
losing the standard parallel
formation, instead employing

166
00:06:58,444 --> 00:06:59,778
a convoy configuration,

167
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,850
which reduces surface area
and vulnerabilities

168
00:07:01,852 --> 00:07:04,386
that were exploited
by the DL's last attack.

169
00:07:04,388 --> 00:07:05,987
We put Ms. Hernandez
in the fourth SUV,

170
00:07:05,989 --> 00:07:08,619
owing to the rule of threes--
the human brain fatigues

171
00:07:08,621 --> 00:07:11,258
after viewing the third object
in a row of pattern,

172
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,490
making the fourth vehicle
the safest spot psychologically.

173
00:07:13,492 --> 00:07:15,026
Also, we use

174
00:07:15,028 --> 00:07:18,162
decoy cars, because,
well, decoys work.

175
00:07:18,164 --> 00:07:20,569
Lastly, Maya needs
to be wearing this.

176
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:23,905
She's a witness,
not a prisoner.

177
00:07:23,907 --> 00:07:26,472
Yeah. There are prisoner transfers at
the courthouse every day.

178
00:07:26,474 --> 00:07:29,376
The DL will be looking for
someone in civilian clothing.

179
00:07:29,378 --> 00:07:32,079
So the bright orange jumpsuit
actually disguises her.

180
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:34,247
All right. Anything else?

181
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:36,583
My team will follow the convoy
with Cabe,

182
00:07:36,585 --> 00:07:38,583
providing a mobile tech hub.

183
00:07:38,585 --> 00:07:41,855
Sylvester will hack the GPS
systems to clear traffic.

184
00:07:41,857 --> 00:07:44,319
Happy will handle any mechanical
issues; Toby will scan

185
00:07:44,321 --> 00:07:46,255
the route to predict
attack patterns.

186
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,192

481
00:21:33,024 --> 00:21:34,654
Now that explains the low EQ.

482
00:21:34,656 --> 00:21:36,390
What the hell is a low EQ?

483
00:21:36,392 --> 00:21:37,791
That.

484
00:21:37,793 --> 00:21:40,263
Okay, well,
I can take care of myself.

485
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:41,631
It's not just about
you anymore.

486
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,399
You think being on the run
will be good for your pregnancy?

487
00:21:43,401 --> 00:21:44,567
You're pregnant?

488
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,367
Oh, boy.

489
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:48,503
We are averaging
70 miles per hour

490
00:21:48,505 --> 00:21:51,606
and the goons are gaining
on us at at least a hundred.

491
00:21:51,608 --> 00:21:53,006
We'd need a racecar.

492
00:21:53,008 --> 00:21:57,182
Actually, I-I know a place near
here where we could get one.

493
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:05,117
Who owns this place?

494
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:06,758
Guy named Ricky Lambert.

495
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,022
He's a hacker who does contract
work for the DL.

496
00:22:09,024 --> 00:22:11,127
He hacks into government
databases

497
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:12,927
and then he makes fake IDs
and passports

498
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:15,368
so they can smuggle contraband
overseas.

499
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,064
Pays better than
what we're doing.

500
00:22:17,066 --> 00:22:18,336
Actually, he's broke.

501
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:20,440
He had to take
a loan out from the DL.

502
00:22:20,442 --> 00:22:22,608
Dude likes to blow his money
on bad habits.

503
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,375
I wouldn't know anything
about that.

504
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:26,407
Lamborghini Aventador LP 700?

505
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:28,543
It's great.
We'd only need four of them.

506
00:22:28,545 --> 00:22:29,878
What about that?

507
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,646
That's a top-of-the-line,
655-horsepower, diesel RV.

508
00:22:33,648 --> 00:22:35,918
With the latest
in smart car tech,

509
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,957
including digital load
balancing, four-wheel braking.

510
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:41,189
We could modify the onboard
computer to maximize speed.

511
00:22:41,191 --> 00:22:45,196
With that, we could outrun
the DL and get Maya to safety.

512
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:47,093
Again, being forced
to testify against the DL

513
00:22:47,095 --> 00:22:49,060
is not returning me to safety.

514
00:22:49,062 --> 00:22:51,468
For now, we just gotta make sure
the DL doesn't catch up to us.

515
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,836
Security's tight.

516
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,772
It'd be tough to sneak through.

517
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:57,036
Don't even try.

518
00:22:57,038 --> 00:22:58,436
Lambert likes to use his muscle.

519
00:22:58,438 --> 00:23:00,340
He likes to pretend he's Hector.

520
00:23:00,342 --> 00:23:03,444
Problem is, we don't have
any muscle of our own.

521
00:23:03,446 --> 00:23:06,316
Yeah, but Lambert
doesn't know that.

522
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,852
Mr. Lambert.

523
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,948
These men claim
to have business with you.

524
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,388
Who the hell are you?

525
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,820
Well, the organizations
who hire me call me Mr. Green.

526
00:23:15,822 --> 00:23:17,628
This is my associate.

527
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,292
Afternoon.

528
00:23:19,294 --> 00:23:21,531
I've come on behalf
of Hector Menjivar.

529
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,796
I believe you know him.

530
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:24,764
He's someone you owe
in a substantial way.

531
00:23:24,766 --> 00:23:27,132
I suggest you invite us in.

532
00:23:27,134 --> 00:23:28,666
Yeah, sure thing.

533
00:23:28,668 --> 00:23:30,138
Yeah, I don't want any trouble.

534
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,937
Thank you.

535
00:23:31,939 --> 00:23:35,239
<i>According to our information,</i>
<i>Mr. Lambert,</i>

536
00:23:35,241 --> 00:23:36,839
you owe Hector
a quarter million dollars

537
00:23:36,841 --> 00:23:38,775
and he doesn't believe...
What? No.

538
00:23:38,777 --> 00:23:41,143
No. I don't owe him
anywhere near that.

539
00:23:42,849 --> 00:23:45,879
Allow me to refresh your memory.

540
00:23:45,881 --> 00:23:47,887
<i>You borrowed $170,000</i>

541
00:23:47,889 --> 00:23:50,120
at 19 points, which bumped up
to 20 points after six months.

542
00:23:50,122 --> 00:23:54,624
After compounding interest,
you owe $252,187.63.

543
00:23:54,626 --> 00:23:56,392
Sly, I think
you've met your match.

544
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:57,589
After compounding interest,

545
00:23:57,591 --> 00:24:03,533
you owe $252,187.63.

546
00:24:03,535 --> 00:24:05,165
So, did I...

547
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:06,934
did I miss anything?

548
00:24:06,936 --> 00:24:08,238
No.

549
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,574
Ooh, the timbre in his voice

550
00:24:09,576 --> 00:24:11,574
means you were right.
Seal the deal; intimidate him.

551
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:13,774
Tell him you want the money now.
I want the money now.

552
00:24:13,776 --> 00:24:14,974
What?

553
00:24:14,976 --> 00:24:16,845
Tell him he wouldn't want
to make you angry.

554
00:24:16,847 --> 00:24:19,181
You wouldn't want me
to get angry.

555
00:24:19,183 --> 00:24:21,212
Tell him he wouldn't like you
when your angry.

556
00:24:21,214 --> 00:24:22,483
Okay, what is he, the Hulk?

557
00:24:22,485 --> 00:24:24,282
You wouldn't like me
when I'm angry,

558
00:24:24,284 --> 00:24:27,250
because my adrenal cortex
releases stress hormones,

559
00:24:27,252 --> 00:24:29,017
I become irritable

560
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:30,353
and I might possibly even

561
00:24:30,355 --> 00:24:31,921
raise my voice.

562
00:24:31,923 --> 00:24:33,721
Nevermind, just slam the table.

563
00:24:36,026 --> 00:24:38,066
Come on, Walt, harder!

564
00:24:41,501 --> 00:24:43,307
Is this guy crazy?

565
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:45,907
You have no idea.

566
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:48,171
Now, Hector told me
to leave here

567
00:24:48,173 --> 00:24:51,075
with either collateral,
or your left hand,

568
00:24:51,077 --> 00:24:54,780
so which one is going to be?

569
00:25:05,229 --> 00:25:06,522
Close the door.

570
00:25:06,524 --> 00:25:08,594
We got to get out of here
before he catches on.

571
00:25:08,596 --> 00:25:10,066
All right, done.
Let's go.

572
00:25:10,068 --> 00:25:12,097
Hector, it's Lambert.

573
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:13,601
Look, I want you to know
I wasn't...

574
00:25:13,603 --> 00:25:15,265
I wasn't trying
to dodge my debt. Okay?

575
00:25:15,267 --> 00:25:17,369
Your guys are on their way
with my RV now.

576
00:25:17,371 --> 00:25:19,305
I'll get you the rest
in a week.

577
00:25:19,307 --> 00:25:21,136
The hell are you talking about?

578
00:25:21,138 --> 00:25:22,143
Hurry up.

579
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:24,101
It's hard to see behind you
in this thing.

580
00:25:25,113 --> 00:25:26,807
I think I hit one of the rocks.

581
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:28,414
All right, floor it.

582
00:25:29,617 --> 00:25:31,919
Come on.
Come on!

583
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,622
What is that noise?

584
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,129
We gotta move, Cabe.
Come on.

585
00:25:40,131 --> 00:25:41,394
I can't! We're stuck!

586
00:25:49,562 --> 00:25:51,792
Come on.

587
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,548
Open the gates.

588
00:25:54,548 --> 00:25:55,818
All right, okay, okay.

589
00:26:05,425 --> 00:26:06,655
Okay, close the gates.

590
00:26:06,658 --> 00:26:07,856
Mm, got it.

591
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,256
Happy, where are you?

592
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,229
Come on, come on, let's go.

593
00:26:18,471 --> 00:26:19,933
Oh, oh, no.

594
00:26:19,935 --> 00:26:21,973
Come on, come on, come on.

595
00:26:21,975 --> 00:26:24,301
What are you doing?

596
00:26:24,303 --> 00:26:25,876
I'm making it so
they can't follow us!

597
00:26:25,878 --> 00:26:27,508
Open the gate now!

598
00:26:37,487 --> 00:26:38,621
Everybody okay?

599
00:26:38,623 --> 00:26:39,884
Still here.

600
00:26:39,886 --> 00:26:41,388
I dropped my yogurt
when we were running, so no.

601
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,756
This guy has a lot of toys.

602
00:26:45,597 --> 00:26:47,795
What about you, Maya?

603
00:26:47,797 --> 00:26:49,659
You all right?

604
00:26:49,661 --> 00:26:51,699
No.

605
00:26:51,701 --> 00:26:54,466
This is never going to end.

606
00:26:54,468 --> 00:26:56,602
I know that Agent Gallo thinks

607
00:26:56,604 --> 00:26:57,906
that the government
can keep me hidden,

608
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:01,370
but you see now the fear that
Hector strikes into people.

609
00:27:01,372 --> 00:27:04,142
Just the idea
that he was angry

610
00:27:04,144 --> 00:27:06,372
got Lambert to hand over
a luxury RV.

611
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:10,007
He has people who don't even
work for him, shooting at us.

612
00:27:10,009 --> 00:27:12,269
I mean, people kill for him.

613
00:27:12,271 --> 00:27:16,004
And after I testify,
he will kill me.

614
00:27:16,006 --> 00:27:17,611
And my child.

615
00:27:17,613 --> 00:27:20,474
I get it,
but what are we going to do?

616
00:27:20,476 --> 00:27:23,610
The Feds want her to testify
or do time for refusing.

617
00:27:23,612 --> 00:27:24,882
They need her.

618
00:27:24,884 --> 00:27:26,785
There's nothing
we can do about it.

619
00:27:26,787 --> 00:27:29,553
I don't like it
any more than you guys.

620
00:27:33,387 --> 00:27:35,561
What if they didn't need her?

621
00:27:35,563 --> 00:27:36,689
They're building a case, Walter.

622
00:27:36,691 --> 00:27:37,857
She's their evidence.

623
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:39,993
She knows their books,
their operation.

624
00:27:39,995 --> 00:27:41,561
She was their bookkeeper
for years.

625
00:27:41,563 --> 00:27:43,769
What if we can create
the books.

626
00:27:43,771 --> 00:27:44,966
Books that Maya
has the information for.

627
00:27:44,968 --> 00:27:46,398
We all heard her back there.

628
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,468
She knows every detail
of their operation

629
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,869
down to the last penny.

630
00:27:49,871 --> 00:27:52,469
We create a computerized diary
of all the DL's dealings.

631
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:54,373
We just need to make it look

632
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:56,405
like it was created
a couple years ago

633
00:27:56,407 --> 00:27:58,677
with digital imprints
that even the best forensics

634
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,045
won't be able to tell are fake.

635
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:02,349
If it contains everything
in Maya's head,

636
00:28:02,351 --> 00:28:03,950
then the Feds don't need Maya

637
00:28:03,952 --> 00:28:06,584
and Hector and his pals
still go up the river.

638
00:28:06,586 --> 00:28:07,720
Can you guys really do that?

639
00:28:07,722 --> 00:28:09,257
Yes.
No.

640
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:11,698
That's fabricating evidence.

641
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,233
The Feds want her on the stand,
under oath.

642
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:15,633
Um, Maya.

643
00:28:15,635 --> 00:28:17,129
Do you swear everything
you're going to tell us

644
00:28:17,131 --> 00:28:19,105
will be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth?

645
00:28:19,107 --> 00:28:20,873
I do.
That works for me.

646
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:22,305
That's a dirty magazine.

647
00:28:22,307 --> 00:28:23,336
Yes, it is.

648
00:28:24,338 --> 00:28:26,008
It's revolting.

649
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,312
Cabe, we need a solution,

650
00:28:27,314 --> 00:28:28,912
so if you're just going
to shoot this down,

651
00:28:28,914 --> 00:28:31,248
then I hope you have
another plan to save Maya.

652
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:34,749
Happy, take the wheel.

653
00:28:34,751 --> 00:28:36,917
I need to make this
as legal as possible.

654
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:39,253
<i>Hector. Look, Hector,</i>
<i>if I knew who they were,</i>

655
00:28:39,255 --> 00:28:40,517
<i>I would've killed them on site.</i>

656
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:41,652
Okay, please.

657
00:28:41,654 --> 00:28:42,955
I thought they
were with you.

658
00:28:42,957 --> 00:28:44,387
And I thought you were
someone who was smart.

659
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,016
You take your time
paying me back,

660
00:28:46,018 --> 00:28:47,688
now you let a bunch
of computer nerds

661
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:48,887
slip right through your fingers.

662
00:28:48,889 --> 00:28:50,359
Computers.

663
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,191
That's it.

664
00:28:52,193 --> 00:28:53,727
We got 'em.

665
00:28:58,532 --> 00:29:01,161
And the phony alcohol stamp
business netted 128?

666
00:29:01,163 --> 00:29:04,233
$128,040.12 in
September of 2008.

667
00:29:04,235 --> 00:29:05,832
In one month? All right.

668
00:29:05,834 --> 00:29:07,368
What's the next entry?

669
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,400
Hey.
Hey.

670
00:29:09,402 --> 00:29:10,704
Can I tell you a story?

671
00:29:10,706 --> 00:29:12,536
I'm driving a 30,000
pound vehicle.

672
00:29:12,538 --> 00:29:14,575
I am focused on the road.

673
00:29:14,577 --> 00:29:16,575
I'll be quick.

674
00:29:16,577 --> 00:29:18,974
When your mom is bipolar

675
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:21,542
and your dad is so passive
that he sometimes doesn't talk

676
00:29:21,544 --> 00:29:24,245
to his son for weeks on end,
not because he's mad at you

677
00:29:24,247 --> 00:29:25,885
but because he forgets
you're there,

678
00:29:25,887 --> 00:29:28,253
you grow up with nothing good,

679
00:29:28,255 --> 00:29:31,253
and you begin to think
you deserve nothing good.

680
00:29:31,255 --> 00:29:34,357
So when something good
is right in front of you,

681
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:37,028
or next to you,
you self-sabotage

682
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,796
because you wouldn't know
what to do

683
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:40,661
with something good
if you had it.

684
00:29:40,663 --> 00:29:42,133
I'm truly sorry, Happy.

685
00:29:42,135 --> 00:29:43,469
I didn't mean to hurt you.

686
00:29:43,471 --> 00:29:46,772
I have worn perfume
once in my life.

687
00:29:46,774 --> 00:29:48,636
Last night.

688
00:29:48,638 --> 00:29:51,539
And I won't do it again.

689
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:54,675
Look, last
night saved us

690
00:29:54,677 --> 00:29:56,443
a year of nonsense
that would've resulted

691
00:29:56,445 --> 00:29:58,315
in us not
being friends.

692
00:29:58,317 --> 00:30:01,683
It's better this way.
Going back to normal.

693
00:30:01,685 --> 00:30:03,515
I think it can still work.

694
00:30:05,325 --> 00:30:06,787
We have problems.

695
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:09,995
Yeah, we all have problems, Happy.
No, we have serious problems.

696
00:30:09,997 --> 00:30:11,595
Who doesn't have serious
problems, you know?

697
00:30:11,597 --> 00:30:12,795
That's what makes us human.

698
00:30:12,797 --> 00:30:14,667
No, idiot. I'm not
in control of the RV.

699
00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:16,466
Someone's hacked
into the onboard

700
00:30:16,468 --> 00:30:18,667
computer and taken
control of this rig.

701
00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:21,634
I have complete autonomy
over the vehicle.

702
00:30:21,636 --> 00:30:23,706
There's nothing they can do.

703
00:30:25,108 --> 00:30:27,275
Oh, man, we're still
accelerating.

704
00:30:29,677 --> 00:30:31,747
Pull the emergency brake.

705
00:30:31,749 --> 00:30:33,915
Uh, nothing. They cut
the power steering.

706
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:36,819
Okay, I've basically got no
control of a 15-ton vehicle.

707
00:30:36,821 --> 00:30:39,291
We're screwed.
Hector must have Lambert doing this.

708
00:30:39,293 --> 00:30:41,091
I'm buckling up.

709
00:30:41,093 --> 00:30:43,227
<i>I can barely keep this thing</i>
<i>on the road.</i>

710
00:30:43,229 --> 00:30:46,363
I'm burying the needle
on these guys.

711
00:30:46,365 --> 00:30:48,068
Someone grab the wheel.
I've got it.

712
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,700
According
to the navigation system,

713
00:30:49,702 --> 00:30:51,668
we're coming to
a three and a half-mile

714
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,437
straightaway,
ending in a sharp turn and a

715
00:30:53,439 --> 00:30:56,006
steep drop off. At this speed
we won't make that turn.

716
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,614
<i>That gives us</i>

717
00:30:59,616 --> 00:31:01,950
two minutes and 38 seconds
until we drive off of the cliff.

718
00:31:01,952 --> 00:31:05,583
Yeah, not if we regain control
of the onboard computer.

719
00:31:05,585 --> 00:31:08,759
Ah, he cut off the wireless.
I can't hack in.

720
00:31:08,761 --> 00:31:10,895
We have to manually
access it. Happy,

721
00:31:10,897 --> 00:31:12,423
can you get it
through the dash?

722
00:31:12,425 --> 00:31:15,432
Not in two minutes.
But there's another way to it.

723
00:31:15,434 --> 00:31:17,664
And we are gonna
need this stuff.

724
00:31:20,202 --> 00:31:22,640
No more than
six feet of rope.

725
00:31:22,642 --> 00:31:29,778
I got it. Be careful.

726
00:31:36,524 --> 00:31:38,121
If you're off
by more than 2 .9 inches,

727
00:31:38,123 --> 00:31:39,585
she'll get
sucked under the wheel.

728
00:31:39,587 --> 00:31:41,225
Appreciate the info.

729
00:31:41,227 --> 00:31:44,424
We got less than two miles,
then we're going over the cliff.

730
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:56,039
Give me some slack.

731
00:32:10,506 --> 00:32:12,168
♪ ♪

732
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:26,916
When we regain control,
Paige, you steer us to

733
00:32:26,918 --> 00:32:28,344
the side of
the road.

734
00:32:28,368 --> 00:32:30,368
Okay.

735
00:32:34,664 --> 00:32:37,055
Be right back.

736
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:38,198
Or not.

737
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:40,798
A minute, 32 until impact.

738
00:32:50,072 --> 00:32:51,846
What took you so long?

739
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:02,749
Oh!
Uh, please tell me you did not

740
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:04,188
just drop the screwdriver.

741
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,124
Okay, I won't.

742
00:33:06,126 --> 00:33:07,219
Try and think of something.

743
00:33:07,221 --> 00:33:08,322
I got it, I got it.

744
00:33:08,324 --> 00:33:10,454
Got it. Think I can reach

745
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:11,453
the hard drive from there.

746
00:33:11,455 --> 00:33:12,988
Time to make
a little room for me.

747
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,322
I'll see you up top. Or not.

748
00:33:26,696 --> 00:33:28,830
30 seconds.

749
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:46,717
All right.

750
00:33:47,551 --> 00:33:49,253
Hi.

751
00:33:49,255 --> 00:33:50,653
15 seconds.

752
00:33:59,894 --> 00:34:01,060
Eight seconds!

753
00:34:06,101 --> 00:34:08,067
Oh, he shut down the computer!

754
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:10,739
Cut the wheel.

755
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:16,339
Oh.

756
00:34:25,882 --> 00:34:27,550
Walter.

757
00:34:31,657 --> 00:34:34,023
Oh, God, no,

758
00:34:34,025 --> 00:34:35,759
no.
What is it?

759
00:34:35,761 --> 00:34:38,391
That's the worst roadkill
I've ever seen.

760
00:34:44,568 --> 00:34:48,302
Okay, we can celebrate our
near-death experience later.

761
00:34:48,304 --> 00:34:50,606
'Cause Hector...
...is still on our tail and

762
00:34:50,608 --> 00:34:53,438
it won't be much longer until
he catches up with us again.

763
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,814
We kind of stand out

764
00:34:55,816 --> 00:34:57,911
in the middle of nowhere
farming country.

765
00:34:57,913 --> 00:34:59,815
That might not such a bad thing.

766
00:34:59,817 --> 00:35:02,751
What the hell does that mean?
I got an idea.

767
00:35:06,089 --> 00:35:10,159
This is federal agent
Cabe Gallo, badge number 2835.

768
00:35:10,161 --> 00:35:12,727
Get me the local
sheriff's office.

769
00:35:18,504 --> 00:35:19,870
<i>Vamano, Jorge, vamano, vamano.</i>
Come on,

770
00:35:19,872 --> 00:35:22,302
<i>come on, faster,</i>
<i>we got to catch 'em!</i>

771
00:35:22,304 --> 00:35:24,470
There they are.

772
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,014
Gun it.

773
00:35:36,286 --> 00:35:39,020
Come on, around the side,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

774
00:35:45,557 --> 00:35:47,763
Get around 'em!

775
00:35:47,765 --> 00:35:50,827
I can't get past 'em.
I can't see ahead of 'em.

776
00:35:51,669 --> 00:35:53,604
Hit the brakes!

777
00:35:56,407 --> 00:35:58,109
Hands up. Don't move.

778
00:35:58,111 --> 00:36:00,278
You pull
that trigger

779
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,815
and it'll be the last
thing you ever do.

780
00:36:14,226 --> 00:36:17,432
Hey. Thanks for hacking the RV.

781
00:36:17,434 --> 00:36:20,531
Gave us the idea to operate it
remotely ourselves.

782
00:36:20,533 --> 00:36:22,741
Except it worked out
for us. Enjoy prison.

783
00:36:35,198 --> 00:36:37,125
Prosecutors
are gonna be pissed.

784
00:36:37,127 --> 00:36:39,063
Well, they won't
be too happy with me.

785
00:36:39,065 --> 00:36:41,672
But at the end of day,
with the data you gave us,

786
00:36:41,674 --> 00:36:44,609
they'll be able to make a RICO
case and put Hector and his boys

787
00:36:44,611 --> 00:36:47,378
away for life.
That's all they care about,

788
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,979
so they'll let it go.

789
00:36:49,981 --> 00:36:51,315
Well,

790
00:36:51,317 --> 00:36:52,651
guess this is good-bye.

791
00:36:52,653 --> 00:36:55,187
Before you go, let me
hear it one more time,

792
00:36:55,189 --> 00:36:56,523
for my own piece of mind.

793
00:36:56,525 --> 00:36:58,355
After Sheriff Barnes
takes me to the bus station,

794
00:36:58,357 --> 00:37:00,395
I buy a ticket to Vancouver.
Once I get there

795
00:37:00,397 --> 00:37:02,059
I go straight
to the U.S. consulate,

796
00:37:02,061 --> 00:37:03,627
request a package
from Cabe Gallo,

797
00:37:03,629 --> 00:37:05,866
and they'll hand it over to me,
no questions asked.

798
00:37:05,868 --> 00:37:07,794
That's right. Inside
you'll find 20 grand

799
00:37:07,796 --> 00:37:10,298
and a brand-new Canadian
identity for you.

800
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,370
Best of luck, kid.

801
00:37:11,372 --> 00:37:13,738
Why are you all
doing this for me?

802
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,938
We promised to protect you.

803
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,441
And you're one of us.

804
00:37:27,882 --> 00:37:31,719
A new country,
fake I.D.s...

805
00:37:31,721 --> 00:37:33,487
Not without
its risks.

806
00:37:33,489 --> 00:37:35,223
She's going to have a child.

807
00:37:35,225 --> 00:37:39,127
When it comes to someone you
love, you have to take risks.

808
00:37:39,129 --> 00:37:41,263
Do you hear that, pal?

809
00:37:41,265 --> 00:37:44,063
You got to take risks
when you love someone.

810
00:38:00,721 --> 00:38:02,415
Authorities have
finally brought down

811
00:38:02,417 --> 00:38:05,519
the notorious leader
of the DL, Hector Menjivar.

812
00:38:05,521 --> 00:38:07,319
The break in the case
was the stunning discovery

813
00:38:07,321 --> 00:38:08,655
of the DL's electronic

814
00:38:08,657 --> 00:38:11,927
financial ledger, recovered
from Menjivar's laptop.

815
00:38:11,929 --> 00:38:14,063
Members of his crew
are already cutting deals

816
00:38:14,065 --> 00:38:15,967
implicating not only Menjivar

817
00:38:15,969 --> 00:38:18,599
but a member of the LAPD
who was allegedly

818
00:38:18,601 --> 00:38:21,808
acting as a mole
for the criminal organization.

819
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:23,936
You were right
about the mole, Toby.

820
00:38:23,938 --> 00:38:26,207
Good night, guys.

821
00:38:26,209 --> 00:38:28,647
That was distant.

822
00:38:28,649 --> 00:38:29,942
That's 'cause she cares.

823
00:38:29,944 --> 00:38:31,781
If she didn't care,
she wouldn't be upset.

824
00:38:33,047 --> 00:38:34,213
What are you doing?

825
00:38:34,215 --> 00:38:36,717
Me? Nothing.
I'm not doing anything.

826
00:38:37,623 --> 00:38:38,885
Okay. So, I found another

827
00:38:38,887 --> 00:38:40,717
Boysenberry Blast
in the back of the fridge

828
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:43,821
and it is past due as well.

829
00:38:43,823 --> 00:38:44,989
Are you kidding me?

830
00:38:44,991 --> 00:38:46,725
You need to take a risk, son.

831
00:38:46,727 --> 00:38:49,293
You see what I did with
Happy? I opened up.

832
00:38:49,295 --> 00:38:51,397
I wore my heart
on my sleeve.

833
00:38:51,399 --> 00:38:53,701
Toby. You were severely burned.

834
00:38:53,703 --> 00:38:57,068
Yes, but I'm living. And
I'm gonna get her back.

835
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,836
Give me this.
Toby.

836
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:01,372
Mmm, mmm, mmm, oh, my God.

837
00:39:01,374 --> 00:39:04,212
Oh, mmm.<i> Delicioso.</i>

838
00:39:04,214 --> 00:39:06,044
Mmm. It's fine,
you big baby.

839
00:39:06,046 --> 00:39:07,348
And because you
didn't take a risk,

840
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,811
someone else got your yogurt.

841
00:39:12,821 --> 00:39:16,723
If you don't take a risk, my
man, Drew's gonna take Paige.

842
00:39:16,725 --> 00:39:18,787
Paige isn't yogurt.

843
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,891
No, she's a risk. One you
need to take. So you need

844
00:39:20,893 --> 00:39:22,995
to get in your car, drive to
her house, knock on her door

845
00:39:22,997 --> 00:39:25,195
and tell her how you feel.

846
00:39:38,311 --> 00:39:40,077
Thank you!

847
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:55,627
