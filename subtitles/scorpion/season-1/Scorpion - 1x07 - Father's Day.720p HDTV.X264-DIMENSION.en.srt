<font color="#808080">WALTER:</font>
<i>My name is Walter O'Brien.</i>

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,469
<i>I have the fourth highest IQ</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

3
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:12,137
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

4
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:14,806
<i>When I was 11, the FBI</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking NASA</i>

5
00:00:14,808 --> 00:00:17,476
<i>to get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

6
00:00:17,478 --> 00:00:19,695
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

7
00:00:19,697 --> 00:00:21,129
<i>tackling worldwide threats</i>

8
00:00:21,131 --> 00:00:22,648
<i>only we can solve.</i>

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,399
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

10
00:00:24,401 --> 00:00:26,134
<i>Sylvester's a human calculator.</i>

11
00:00:26,136 --> 00:00:28,453
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

12
00:00:28,455 --> 00:00:30,739
<i>Agent Cabe Gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

13
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:32,991
<i>And Paige?</i>
<i>Well, Paige isn't like us.</i>

14
00:00:32,993 --> 00:00:35,460
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

15
00:00:35,462 --> 00:00:38,113
<i>while we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

16
00:00:38,115 --> 00:00:40,215
<i>Together, we are Scorpion.</i>

17
00:00:41,552 --> 00:00:43,552
Orange, purple, tan, pink,
blue, blue, green.

18
00:00:43,554 --> 00:00:44,476
870!

19
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,422
Don't hit it so hard,
you'll mess up my wiring.

20
00:00:46,423 --> 00:00:48,991
I am going to slap it
like it owes me money.

21
00:00:48,993 --> 00:00:50,325
Speaking of which--
890.

22
00:00:51,011 --> 00:00:52,561
I can do it
with my eyes closed.

23
00:00:52,563 --> 00:00:53,512
Green, purple, purple, pink.

24
00:00:53,514 --> 00:00:56,264
I don't like you
when you're cocky.

25
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:59,901
Hey! Picked up some
healthier fare for the fridge.

26
00:00:59,903 --> 00:01:03,355
You know, tuna, yogurt...

27
00:01:03,357 --> 00:01:04,740
brain foods...

28
00:01:04,742 --> 00:01:06,308
So glad I try.

29
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,442
Ka-ching!

30
00:01:07,444 --> 00:01:08,694
Come on.

31
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:10,612
Should I ask?

32
00:01:10,614 --> 00:01:11,830
I rigged the game

33
00:01:11,832 --> 00:01:14,032
so it'll generate a thousand
sequence color pattern.

34
00:01:14,034 --> 00:01:15,751
And you're betting on whether
Sylvester's memorized it.

35
00:01:15,753 --> 00:01:16,753
That's sane.

36
00:01:16,754 --> 00:01:17,919
Where's Walter?

37
00:01:27,214 --> 00:01:28,764
<font color="#808080">PAIGE:</font>
Hey!

38
00:01:28,766 --> 00:01:30,549
Finally got that Reseda client
to pay for their system upgrade.

39
00:01:30,551 --> 00:01:31,683
I sent them
a lawyer letter.

40
00:01:31,685 --> 00:01:32,868
We don't have a lawyer.

41
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,219
They don't know that.

42
00:01:34,221 --> 00:01:36,138
What's this?

43
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,189
Well, if I can map and download

44
00:01:37,191 --> 00:01:39,307
this fellow's memory
of the maze pattern,

45
00:01:39,309 --> 00:01:41,309
then I can do the same for a human.
Losing me.

46
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:42,811
I can transfer someone's
thoughts, consciousness,

47
00:01:42,813 --> 00:01:43,945
their very
being forever.

48
00:01:43,947 --> 00:01:45,197
And, unfortunately,

49
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:47,399
I happen to be working
with a stupid mouse. Hey!

50
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:49,217
Are you doing this
for your sister?

51
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:50,535
Yeah.

52
00:01:50,537 --> 00:01:52,454
And for anybody else
whose body betrays them.

53
00:01:52,456 --> 00:01:53,705
What's his name?

54
00:01:53,707 --> 00:01:55,774
<font color="#D900D9">(phone rings)</font>
Why would I name a mouse?

55
00:01:55,776 --> 00:01:57,993
'Cause it's fun.
<font color="#D900D9">(phone rings)</font>

56
00:01:57,995 --> 00:01:59,111
The phone's ringing!

57
00:01:59,113 --> 00:02:00,195
<font color="#808080">TOBY:</font>
We're gambling!

58
00:02:00,197 --> 00:02:02,114
This mouse is difficult
and stubborn.

59
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:03,448
I'll call him Cabe Junior.
<font color="#D900D9">(answering machine plays)</font>

60
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,033
That's good.

61
00:02:05,035 --> 00:02:07,452
Remind me why
no digital voice mail.

62
00:02:07,454 --> 00:02:08,704
'Cause you can't hack analog.

<font color="#808080">MAN:</font> Um, hi, this message is
for Paige Dineen.

65
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:13,508
This is Drew Baker.

66
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,960
I know it's been
a long time, Paige,

67
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:16,294
I got your info from the diner.

68
00:02:16,296 --> 00:02:17,763
I was hoping that we could talk.
No... no, no, no.

69
00:02:17,765 --> 00:02:19,514
I'd really like to see you guys.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

70
00:02:19,516 --> 00:02:20,649
Really would.
No. No. No.

71
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:22,050
I'm at the same cell number.
No. No, no.

72
00:02:22,052 --> 00:02:23,372
Okay, bye.
No, no, no, no. No. No.

73
00:02:24,138 --> 00:02:25,854
The hell was that all about?

74
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:27,806
Nothing. An acquaintance.

75
00:02:27,808 --> 00:02:29,891
You don't sprint down stairs
for an acquaintance.

76
00:02:29,893 --> 00:02:31,393
Who's Drew?
Old friend.

77
00:02:31,395 --> 00:02:32,978
Bumped from acquaintance
to old friend in three seconds.

78
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,980
Interesting.

79
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:36,648
Look, it's really not important.

80
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,700
You just put your hand
on your stomach.

81
00:02:38,702 --> 00:02:40,485
A subconscious protection marker
where you once carried a child.

82
00:02:40,487 --> 00:02:43,405
Is Drew Ralph's father?
I didn't know Ralph had a father.

83
00:02:43,407 --> 00:02:44,570
How exactly do
you think babies are made?

84
00:02:44,594 --> 00:02:45,825
You know what I mean.

85
00:02:45,826 --> 00:02:48,460
Not that it's any
of your business,

86
00:02:48,462 --> 00:02:50,579
but Ralph's dad is a minor
league baseball player...

87
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:51,963
Great, a jock!

88
00:02:51,965 --> 00:02:53,665
We bounced around a lot,
team to team,

89
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:56,084
and we agreed Ralph
should have some stability.

90
00:02:56,086 --> 00:02:59,554
We settled in L.A. and Drew was
gonna come out after his season.

91
00:02:59,556 --> 00:03:01,089
He got a job pitching
in Mexico, then Tampa,

92
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:02,474
then you can fill in the rest.

93
00:03:02,476 --> 00:03:03,692
How long has it been
since he's seen Ralph?

94
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:04,727
Seven years.

95
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:05,728
Oh, that's great.

96
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:06,729
Father of the year...

97
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,846
uh, excuse me, seven years.

98
00:03:07,848 --> 00:03:09,397
Drew's a difficult part
of my life

99
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:10,849
that wasn't easy
to put behind me.

100
00:03:10,851 --> 00:03:14,319
And I'm certainly not dusting
it off with you guys,

101
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:16,354
so there'll be no further
discussion on this issue.

102
00:03:16,356 --> 00:03:18,490
Paige, you want to know
if he's a good guy?

103
00:03:18,492 --> 00:03:19,858
Watch him eat fruit.

104
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,860
If he digs into the flesh
with his fingernails--

105
00:03:21,862 --> 00:03:23,495
a primordial sign
of aggression.

106
00:03:23,497 --> 00:03:26,865
But if he peels it in one long
curl, that is a planner.

107
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:28,917
He's right;
I'm very gentle with plums.

108
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,710
Guys, we are not
giving him fruit.

109
00:03:30,734 --> 00:03:32,171
Thank you.

110
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:34,039
I can just hack his credit info,
see what he's been up to,

111
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,124
if he's any risk to Ralph.
Absolutely not.

112
00:03:36,126 --> 00:03:37,876
This isn't communal
child rearing.

113
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:39,845
I'll decide if I call Drew back.

114
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:40,879
No one else.

115
00:03:40,881 --> 00:03:41,930
<font color="#808080">CABE:</font>
What's going on?

116
00:03:41,932 --> 00:03:44,049
Ralph's father's back in town.

117
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:45,851
Oh, I see.

118
00:03:45,853 --> 00:03:47,210
Is that something you want
to discuss with everyone?

119
00:03:47,234 --> 00:03:48,721
No.

120
00:03:48,722 --> 00:03:49,855
<font color="#808080">CABE:</font>
Then it's settled.

121
00:03:49,857 --> 00:03:51,890
Personal business
stays personal.

122
00:03:51,892 --> 00:03:54,142
Besides, we got some real
business to attend to.

123
00:03:54,144 --> 00:03:56,945
Three cons just escaped from
Hamilton Federal Penitentiary.

124
00:03:56,947 --> 00:03:58,230
High-tech prison.

125
00:03:58,232 --> 00:03:59,564
Inmates had
morning exercise;

126
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:01,566
when they called line-up,
they were gone.

127
00:04:01,568 --> 00:04:02,868
No tunnels,

128
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,903
no compromised
fences, gone.

129
00:04:04,905 --> 00:04:06,238
They want you to determine

130
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,073
how they beat their
state-of-the-art security.

131
00:04:08,075 --> 00:04:09,958
You want us to go
inside of a prison?

132
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,909
Are you serious?

133
00:04:10,911 --> 00:04:12,160
Like a Peek Frean.

134
00:04:12,162 --> 00:04:13,745
The hell's
a Peek Frean?

135
00:04:13,747 --> 00:04:15,497
It's a cookie.

136
00:04:15,499 --> 00:04:16,965
Kind your grandma used
to give out?

137
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:18,166
They had that slogan--

138
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:21,336
“Peek Freans are
a very serious cookie.”

139
00:04:23,106 --> 00:04:24,172
How young are you guys?

140
00:04:24,174 --> 00:04:25,423
How old are<i> you?</i>

141
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:27,425
Let's get in the car.

142
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:31,429
You know, eight
out of ten inmates had dads

143
00:04:31,431 --> 00:04:33,265
that were in and out
of the picture?

144
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:35,600
Just saying.
Shut it, Doc.

145
00:04:35,602 --> 00:04:37,736
I may be overstepping my bounds...
You are.

146
00:04:37,738 --> 00:04:39,604
But a quick run of
potentialities yields few,

147
00:04:39,606 --> 00:04:42,107
if any, positive outcomes
from that phone call.

148
00:04:42,109 --> 00:04:44,025
An absent father returning
out of the blue

149
00:04:44,027 --> 00:04:45,694
is fraught with peril.

150
00:04:45,696 --> 00:04:48,613
I know none of you have any idea
how inappropriate this all is,

151
00:04:48,615 --> 00:04:50,282
but it's off the charts.

152
00:04:51,335 --> 00:04:52,450
You've been quiet.

153
00:04:52,452 --> 00:04:54,452
No advice on how
to run my life?

154
00:04:54,454 --> 00:04:56,454
I don't know
anything about dads.

155
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:01,042
<font color="#808080">CABE:</font>
<i>Welcome to prison.</i>

156
00:05:05,632 --> 00:05:07,098
Don't worry, son.

157
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,602
You just tell me
how you hacked into NASA,

158
00:05:10,604 --> 00:05:13,305
and I promise everything
will be okay.

<font color="#D900D9">(prisoners catcalling,

160
00:05:28,655 --> 00:05:30,789
Should Happy and
Paige be here?

161
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:33,041
They're talking
to you.

162
00:05:34,995 --> 00:05:37,662
Sergey Antonovich and
Roman Volkovsky's cell.

163
00:05:37,664 --> 00:05:38,747
Russian outfit.

164
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:41,616
Both doing a dime
for identity theft.

165
00:05:41,618 --> 00:05:42,834
Well, clearly scumbags,

166
00:05:42,836 --> 00:05:44,886
but they don't seem
to have the technical acumen

167
00:05:44,888 --> 00:05:46,171
to break out of this place.

168
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:47,589
This one does.

169
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:49,224
Here, let me look.

170
00:05:50,677 --> 00:05:52,394
Percy Tate.

171
00:05:53,063 --> 00:05:54,229
You know the guy?

172
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:55,230
Everybody does;
he's a “hacktivist.”

173
00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:57,649
Borderline genius, IQ-- 150.

174
00:05:57,651 --> 00:05:59,935
The sweet spot-- it's high
enough to be mentally gifted

175
00:05:59,937 --> 00:06:01,353
and low enough
to not be like us.

176
00:06:01,355 --> 00:06:02,737
A few years ago, he didn't like

177
00:06:02,739 --> 00:06:04,656
the voter fraud tactics of a
couple congressional candidates.

178
00:06:04,658 --> 00:06:07,359
So he embedded a virus
into the electoral system.

179
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:09,327
At the end of the election, he
reset all the votes down to zero

180
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:12,998
with a message-- “Do it again;
don't cheat this time.”

181
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,699
What the hell is the
Robin Hood of nerds

182
00:06:14,701 --> 00:06:16,451
doing with Russian
outfit guys?

183
00:06:16,453 --> 00:06:17,702
No idea.

184
00:06:17,704 --> 00:06:19,871
Was a model prisoner till he
disappeared without a clue.

185
00:06:19,873 --> 00:06:22,090
Now, our gates are wired
to a central system.

186
00:06:22,092 --> 00:06:23,758
We show no breach.

187
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,126
Security film's clean.

188
00:06:25,128 --> 00:06:26,795
Are all your gates
under surveillance?

189
00:06:26,797 --> 00:06:28,179
All but...

190
00:06:28,181 --> 00:06:30,849
but one.

191
00:06:30,851 --> 00:06:33,101
This is it.

192
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:35,220
It used to lead
to the loading dock,

193
00:06:35,222 --> 00:06:37,022
but not since an
upgrade 20 years ago.

194
00:06:37,024 --> 00:06:39,057
It ends five feet in.

195
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:41,059
I don't think they went
through this gate.

196
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:43,028
I think they just
used it to escape.

197
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,229
Happy?

198
00:06:53,407 --> 00:06:54,456
Right here.

199
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,657
It's been spackled.

200
00:06:57,244 --> 00:06:59,461
Matched the color
with toothpaste.

201
00:07:01,331 --> 00:07:03,548
I'm so turned on.

202
00:07:04,418 --> 00:07:07,252
This wire runs to the gate lock.

203
00:07:07,254 --> 00:07:08,453
And this is
a wireless transmitter

204
00:07:08,455 --> 00:07:11,322
that's been spliced into it.

205
00:07:11,324 --> 00:07:12,674
The escaped cons worked
maintenance duty?

206
00:07:12,676 --> 00:07:13,641
Moved about freely?

207
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:15,510
Cons with privileges
can move about

208
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:16,728
during specific periods
during the day.

209
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,564
Including work detail
and morning PT,

210
00:07:19,566 --> 00:07:20,515
when they broke out.

211
00:07:20,517 --> 00:07:22,567
You want to know
how they did it?

212
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:24,069
When the prisoners returned
their supplies

213
00:07:24,071 --> 00:07:25,520
to the maintenance closet,

214
00:07:25,522 --> 00:07:28,673
<i>they knew that no cameras would</i>
<i>be watching a defunct gate.</i>

215
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:30,959
<i>So they only needed a minute to</i>
<i>get through that wall.</i>

216
00:07:30,961 --> 00:07:33,244
<font color="#808080">HAPPY:</font><i> They attach a transmitter</i>
<i>to catch a signal</i>

217
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:36,031
<i>to open the gate, which is</i>
<i>then sent to a cell phone.</i>

218
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:37,699
A transmitter is small.

219
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:39,117
But a cell phone?

220
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:41,453
Nothing that big could get
in or out of my prison.

221
00:07:41,455 --> 00:07:42,455
Except convicts.

222
00:07:42,456 --> 00:07:43,955
What?
What?

223
00:07:43,957 --> 00:07:46,958
Hey, has this door been opened
anytime over the last few days?

224
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,628
Antonovich dropped a can
of cleanser through the bars,

225
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,530
and we opened it
to let him get it.

226
00:07:52,532 --> 00:07:53,765
You know, the gates
would only need

227
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:55,300
to be opened once
to get the access signal.

228
00:07:55,302 --> 00:07:57,685
If the other gates<i> are</i> under
surveillance, they'd be seen.

229
00:07:57,687 --> 00:08:00,638
Not if their phone was
programmed with an EMP device.

230
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,441
Localized burst would disable
a camera for three seconds.

231
00:08:03,443 --> 00:08:05,760
<font color="#808080">SYLVESTER:</font> That's enough time
to get through any prison gate

232
00:08:05,762 --> 00:08:06,861

233
00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:08,480
I think I know
how they got the phone in.

234
00:08:08,482 --> 00:08:10,782
I'd like to go
outside now, please.

237
00:08:22,412 --> 00:08:25,330

238
00:08:25,332 --> 00:08:27,165

00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:30,135
<font color="#808080">WALTER:</font> Warden, when was the last time
the cons had extended yard time?

240
00:08:30,137 --> 00:08:32,337
Three days ago,
cell-block baseball.

241
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:33,755
One of the escapees
played right field.

242
00:08:33,757 --> 00:08:35,957
How do you know that?
My dad made me play right field.

243
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:37,258
The worst player's
always put there because

244
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,177
the ball is usually hit
to the center or to the left.

245
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,262
If a convict was receiving
contraband out here,

246
00:08:41,264 --> 00:08:42,564
like a cell phone,

247
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:44,682
he'd definitely want
to play right field,

248
00:08:44,684 --> 00:08:46,634
because nobody pays attention
to the right fielder.

249
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:49,521
So, they smuggled in
contraband during a game.

250
00:08:49,523 --> 00:08:52,073
Surely, you can't be serious.
Serious as a Peek Frean.

251
00:08:52,075 --> 00:08:53,658
And don't call me Shirley.

252
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,610
Bam! That's how you do it, Cabe.

253
00:08:55,612 --> 00:08:57,145
<font color="#808080">WALTER:</font> It's easier than
you realize, Warden.

254
00:08:57,147 --> 00:09:00,031
See, the Russians are organized
crime, they have outside help.

255
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:02,250
So, while everyone else
is watching the game,

256
00:09:02,252 --> 00:09:04,702
a bird flies 30 feet
above the yard.

257
00:09:04,704 --> 00:09:06,588
Except, it's not a bird,
it's an MAV,

258
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,840
a micro air vehicle.

259
00:09:08,842 --> 00:09:12,877
Now, black market drones go
for low five figures.

260
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,712
And the drone
drops the phone

261
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:16,097
right into the right
fielder's glove.

262
00:09:16,099 --> 00:09:18,883
These guys like baseball,
just like Drew.

263
00:09:18,885 --> 00:09:22,036
Did he ever play
in a penal league?

264
00:09:22,038 --> 00:09:24,522
Here you are.

265
00:09:24,524 --> 00:09:26,608
Surveillance of Hamilton
Penitentiary ball game

266
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,892
three days ago.

267
00:09:27,894 --> 00:09:29,043
How did you get that?

268
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:30,195
Ah, it's
not that hard.

269
00:09:30,197 --> 00:09:31,146
Look! Right there.

270
00:09:31,148 --> 00:09:33,148
There's the drone.

271
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,116
Maybe that's
just a bird.

272
00:09:35,118 --> 00:09:38,069
<font color="#808080">TOBY:</font> Well, that bird is taking

I'll be damned.

274
00:09:40,457 --> 00:09:41,457
That's a phone.

275
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,907
Whoever made
that drop wasn't far

276
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:44,058
outside these walls.

277
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,376
Soon as
they were done,

278
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:47,462
I bet they stopped flying
that bird and just took off.

279
00:09:47,464 --> 00:09:50,748
Assuming a two-pound drone
with a lithium battery,

280
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,084
12-inch wingspan,
six-knot winds,

281
00:09:53,086 --> 00:09:55,003
it would have glided to a stop

282
00:09:55,005 --> 00:09:58,256
roughly 1.37 miles
southeast of here.

283
00:09:58,258 --> 00:09:59,757
Take Sylvester, find that drone.

284
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:01,893
Look, I don't care about
the location of the drone,

285
00:10:01,895 --> 00:10:03,144
I care about the
location of my convicts.

286
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:04,429
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

287
00:10:04,431 --> 00:10:06,514
Here's a satellite image
of one of the cons

288
00:10:06,516 --> 00:10:08,183
running
by the tree line.

289
00:10:08,185 --> 00:10:10,235
I really don't want you
hacking into U.S. satellites

290
00:10:10,237 --> 00:10:11,186
without permission.

291
00:10:11,188 --> 00:10:12,937
I'm not; these are China's.

293
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:16,858
Look at how that other guy
is grabbing Percy.

294
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,277
How much time did he have left?
Ten months.

295
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,196
Why would he want to break out
now with short time left?

296
00:10:21,198 --> 00:10:23,198
Yeah, maybe he didn't want
to break out.

297
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,832
He's got a funny way
of showing it.

298
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:27,835
What if they forced him to?

299
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:29,537
They needed him to escape.

300
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:31,456
The odds are-- they need him
for something else.

301
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,458
Otherwise, you would have
already found his corpse by now.

302
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,759
Warden, the chances are--
you're dealing

303
00:10:34,761 --> 00:10:35,960
with two jailbreaks,
one kidnapping.

304
00:10:35,962 --> 00:10:37,545
Let me see this.

305
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:42,267
You know, Percy Tate's
highly intelligent

306
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:44,185
and was vulnerable here.

307
00:10:44,187 --> 00:10:47,555
He was quite possibly
taken advantage of.

308
00:10:47,557 --> 00:10:50,808
Ralph's also
vulnerable,

309
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,976
like most child geniuses.

310
00:10:51,978 --> 00:10:53,394
I can see you're
getting to something.

311
00:10:53,396 --> 00:10:54,696
I was about
Ralph's age

312
00:10:54,698 --> 00:10:56,147
when Cabe suddenly
appeared in my life.

313
00:10:56,149 --> 00:10:58,533
My dad was a good man,

314
00:10:58,535 --> 00:11:00,952
but he never really
understood me.

315
00:11:00,954 --> 00:11:02,320
So Cabe filled a void.

316
00:11:02,322 --> 00:11:04,822
But when things got
complicated between us,

317
00:11:04,824 --> 00:11:07,792
it was hard to bounce back.

318
00:11:07,794 --> 00:11:09,160
I get it.

319
00:11:09,162 --> 00:11:10,662
But I can handle it.
Okay?

320
00:11:14,134 --> 00:11:15,917
This would be
a tough situation

321
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:18,586
if Ralph were
a regular kid.

322
00:11:18,588 --> 00:11:20,805
We could look
into the guy.

323
00:11:20,807 --> 00:11:23,675
Ah, she told me not to.

324
00:11:23,677 --> 00:11:25,009
That's right.

The bird wasn't on recon mode,

335
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:00,782
But I did
study the code

336
00:12:00,784 --> 00:12:02,201
that Percy used to
rig the election.

337
00:12:02,203 --> 00:12:03,869
It was able to change
vote tallies

338
00:12:03,871 --> 00:12:05,204
in the one-tenth of a second

339
00:12:05,206 --> 00:12:07,072
it took to digitally
transfer the data

340
00:12:07,074 --> 00:12:08,991
from the various districts
to the election commissioner.

341
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:11,160
He expertly
exploited

342
00:12:11,162 --> 00:12:13,745
a miniscule point
of failure.

343
00:12:13,747 --> 00:12:15,247
He's quite bright.

344
00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:17,583
Make sure you get him
to sign your yearbook

345

00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:20,836
You see?
That is the problem.

347
00:12:20,838 --> 00:12:22,971
Percy Tate's a brilliant mind,
and you mock him.

348
00:12:22,973 --> 00:12:26,475
He's a criminal, who clearly
masterminded this breakout.

349
00:12:26,477 --> 00:12:28,844
He's mentally enabled,
and I think he may have been

350
00:12:28,846 --> 00:12:30,229
taken advantage of
because of it.

we lose peripheral vision,

He took this number five

00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:07,135
and stuck it next to the “X.”

00:15:07,137 --> 00:15:09,254
And he pushed it
all the way to the right

from the middle of the rack.

00:15:12,426 --> 00:15:13,892
plus five
is 15.

428
00:15:13,894 --> 00:15:17,262
He wasn't pushing it right,
he was pushing it east.

would investigate
this crime scene.

He had seconds to leave

You use that to stay
in touch with me.

469
00:16:40,013 --> 00:16:41,430
I'd hate to think

470
00:16:41,432 --> 00:16:43,598
that this would the last time
I'd see someone like you.

471

Anything?

472
00:16:49,022 --> 00:16:51,106
Walter.
Any-Anything?

473
00:16:51,108 --> 00:16:53,108
Um, made the alerts look like
they're malfunctioning,

474
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,659
but no response yet.

475
00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:56,595
<font color="#808080">PAIGE:</font>
There's a message

476
00:16:56,597 --> 00:16:57,913
in those I-15 signs?

477
00:16:57,915 --> 00:17:00,198
There's a pattern mimicking
Pascal's triangle.

478
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,033
Each number is the sum
of the two numbers above,

479
00:17:02,035 --> 00:17:04,419
except for the edges,
which are all ones.

480
00:17:04,421 --> 00:17:06,288
If you shade in all
the odd numbers,

481
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,206
what you're left
with is an address

482
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,624
for an online bulletin board
that is secure,

483
00:17:09,626 --> 00:17:11,293
which he can
reach us at for help.

484
00:17:11,295 --> 00:17:12,761
After passing a few signs,

485
00:17:12,763 --> 00:17:14,629
a coder like Percy
should pick up on it.

486
00:17:14,631 --> 00:17:16,515
How could he miss it?

487
00:17:26,944 --> 00:17:29,728
I got general background
information on Mr. Drew Baker.

488
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:30,730
Great.
What'd you find?

489
00:17:30,731 --> 00:17:31,947
Lots.

490
00:17:31,949 --> 00:17:33,114
From a personality standpoint,

491
00:17:33,116 --> 00:17:34,733
he displayed
just moderate empathy

492
00:17:34,735 --> 00:17:35,817
for someone who just lost a dog.

493
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:38,320
And when I made
physical contact with him,

494
00:17:38,322 --> 00:17:40,121
he defaulted
to a combative stance

495
00:17:40,123 --> 00:17:41,289
instead of one of defense.

496
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,124
He might have a short temper.

497
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:44,159
Where'd you touch him?

498
00:17:44,161 --> 00:17:46,161
His lips.
Very softly.

499
00:17:46,163 --> 00:17:48,079
I touched his arm, potato-head.

500
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:49,498
And not for nothing,
but he was

501
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,832
a little judgmental

502
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:52,334
when I told him I had
a teacup Chihuahua.

503
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:53,835
He's a macho putz.

504
00:17:53,837 --> 00:17:56,338
Even worse,
background check shows

505
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,039
he plead guilty to
a battery charge

506
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,892
12 years ago, before
he knew Paige.

507
00:18:00,894 --> 00:18:02,260
I couldn't find
the details online,

508
00:18:02,262 --> 00:18:03,378
but I'm still
looking.

509
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,346
Battery?

510
00:18:04,348 --> 00:18:06,147
And he wants to see Ralph?

511
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:07,766
This guy, he
seemed impulsive.

512
00:18:07,768 --> 00:18:09,150
I wouldn't put it
past him coming here.

I don't blame you for hating me.

529
00:18:44,972 --> 00:18:46,137
Has nothing to do with me.

530
00:18:46,139 --> 00:18:47,272
It has to do with my son.

533
00:18:49,526 --> 00:18:50,609
Fair enough.

534
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:52,227
Look, I know the damage
that I caused

535
00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:54,195
because I just wanted
to run around,

536
00:18:54,197 --> 00:18:56,565
play ball like a child,
act like a child...

537

But baseball
is going away.

washed-up reliever.

539
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:04,956

I did in my life...

540
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,325

00:22:33,848 --> 00:22:35,748
Get your hands up like this.

629
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,916
All right?

630
00:22:36,918 --> 00:22:38,250
When they come at you,

631
00:22:38,252 --> 00:22:41,086
you're gonna block and counter.

632
00:22:41,088 --> 00:22:43,339
All right? Rule number one.

633
00:22:43,341 --> 00:22:44,473
Always go for the nose.

634
00:22:44,475 --> 00:22:46,475
Hands up.

635
00:22:46,477 --> 00:22:48,060
You ready? Here it comes.

636
00:22:48,062 --> 00:22:50,362
There you go, perfect.

637
00:22:50,364 --> 00:22:53,482
You got to be more
careful, Walter.

638
00:22:53,484 --> 00:22:55,935
You guys could've
been killed.

639
00:22:57,188 --> 00:22:59,104
All right, it didn't go
according to plan,

640
00:22:59,106 --> 00:23:00,773
but I was right
about the kidnapping.

641
00:23:00,775 --> 00:23:02,525
Now's not the time
to poke the bear.

642
00:23:02,527 --> 00:23:03,692
This Russian outfit

643
00:23:03,694 --> 00:23:05,744
has safe houses all over L.A.

644
00:23:05,746 --> 00:23:06,996
and the Inland Empire.

645
00:23:06,998 --> 00:23:09,498
These guys are in the wind now.
<font color="#808080">SYLVESTER:</font> Uh, Walter?

646
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,200
Seems when Birdroni went
through the window,

647
00:23:11,202 --> 00:23:12,701
he smashed Percy's computer,

648
00:23:12,703 --> 00:23:16,038
but he caught an image
of the laptop.

649
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,707
That is the code that Percy used
to hack the election,

650
00:23:18,709 --> 00:23:20,009
but he's changing it.

651
00:23:20,011 --> 00:23:21,377
He's got
an account-siphon router

652
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:22,511
with a foreign prefix.

653
00:23:22,513 --> 00:23:23,963
Which means...
Which means

654
00:23:23,965 --> 00:23:25,714
the Russians are making him
modify his software,

655
00:23:25,716 --> 00:23:27,516
and part of it has to do
with sending money overseas,

656
00:23:27,518 --> 00:23:29,552
but I can't tell where
just from looking at this.

657
00:23:29,554 --> 00:23:30,636
I'll have
the Treasury Department

658
00:23:30,638 --> 00:23:31,637
trace this account number.

659
00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:32,938
Percy should be traced as well.

660
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,274
After what happened here,
the convicts must know

661
00:23:35,276 --> 00:23:36,892
that he's the one that tipped
their location.

662
00:23:36,894 --> 00:23:38,477
He won't be able
to contact us again.

663
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:39,895
They'll be watching him
like a hawk.

664
00:23:39,897 --> 00:23:41,647
So then we'll be watching them.

665
00:23:41,649 --> 00:23:43,232
If we can capture
the digital I.D.

666
00:23:43,234 --> 00:23:44,984
from when Percy IM'd us,
we should be able

667
00:23:44,986 --> 00:23:46,702
to track it
to his computer's IP address.

668
00:23:46,704 --> 00:23:48,320
We can hack his webcam
and watch him,

669
00:23:48,322 --> 00:23:50,372
and maybe we can get a clue
as to where he is

670
00:23:50,374 --> 00:23:51,657
or what they're forcing him
to do.

671
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:53,325
It's worth a shot.

672
00:23:53,327 --> 00:23:55,377
Let's do it.

673
00:23:55,379 --> 00:23:57,746
<font color="#808080">PAIGE:</font>
The sitter will be here soon,

674
00:23:57,748 --> 00:23:59,164
but I wanted to talk
to you first.

675
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:00,249
Okay?

676
00:24:00,251 --> 00:24:01,300
It's a tangram.

677
00:24:01,302 --> 00:24:02,751
It's shapes made out of shapes.

678
00:24:02,753 --> 00:24:05,404
It's squares squared.

679
00:24:05,406 --> 00:24:07,089
Wow.

680
00:24:07,091 --> 00:24:09,174
That's very cool.

681
00:24:09,176 --> 00:24:11,176
Sweetheart,

682
00:24:11,178 --> 00:24:13,462
what do you remember
about your father?

683
00:24:13,464 --> 00:24:14,563
He was tall.

684
00:24:14,565 --> 00:24:15,731
He liked his toast burnt,

685
00:24:15,733 --> 00:24:17,766
and he left to see a movie.

686
00:24:17,768 --> 00:24:18,817
What?

687
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:20,019
When we left for L.A.,

688
00:24:20,021 --> 00:24:21,987
he said he'd catch up
with us later.

689
00:24:21,989 --> 00:24:23,689
He was just going
to see a movie.

690
00:24:23,691 --> 00:24:27,693
There were 12 theaters
within 20 miles of our home.

691
00:24:27,695 --> 00:24:31,413
48 screens, 227 showings.

692
00:24:31,415 --> 00:24:34,700
Average run time-- 112 minutes.

693
00:24:37,588 --> 00:24:40,923
Maybe he just wanted to stay
and see more movies.

694
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:46,762
<font color="#808080">TOBY:</font>
I know you're gonna tell me

695
00:24:46,764 --> 00:24:48,430
to “shut it” again,
but watching a kid learn

696
00:24:48,432 --> 00:24:50,683
that Daddy's come back
has got to be hurting you.

697
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,386
I'm not your patient, Doc.

698
00:24:54,388 --> 00:24:55,938
But you are my friend.

699
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,890
Here.

700
00:24:57,892 --> 00:24:59,358
While checking on Drew today,

701
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,776
I also hacked Social Services,

702
00:25:00,778 --> 00:25:02,394
pulled your records.

703
00:25:02,396 --> 00:25:04,396
There is some photos in there

704
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:06,565
of your dad, your mother.

705
00:25:06,567 --> 00:25:08,817
My mother died
during childbirth.

706
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:10,953
You have the wrong paperwork.

707
00:25:10,955 --> 00:25:13,572
Your dad put photos in there in
case you ever pulled your file.

708
00:25:13,574 --> 00:25:14,990
I'm a decent hacker.

709
00:25:14,992 --> 00:25:17,126
I could've gotten this
myself if I wanted.

710
00:25:17,128 --> 00:25:19,244
But<i> he</i> left<i> me.</i>

711
00:25:19,246 --> 00:25:21,246
I am not chasing him.

712
00:25:21,248 --> 00:25:23,465
I don't need him.

713
00:25:34,045 --> 00:25:36,428
I love you, Ralph.

714
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,430
Hi, Ralph.

715
00:25:37,431 --> 00:25:38,564
I'll see you
when I get home.

716
00:25:38,566 --> 00:25:40,432
Hi.
Hi.

717
00:25:40,434 --> 00:25:41,400
Drive carefully.

718
00:25:41,402 --> 00:25:42,601
Okay.

719
00:25:43,354 --> 00:25:46,238
Bye!
Bye.

720
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,490
Hey.
Hey.

721
00:25:50,244 --> 00:25:52,361
Uh...
<font color="#D900D9">(clears throat)</font>

722
00:25:52,363 --> 00:25:53,946
I don't want
to butt in, but, um,

723
00:25:53,948 --> 00:25:56,031
can I at least ask
how he took it?

724
00:25:56,033 --> 00:25:58,083
I couldn't tell him.

725
00:25:58,085 --> 00:25:59,234
Not yet.

726
00:25:59,236 --> 00:26:01,120
That's prudent.

727
00:26:01,122 --> 00:26:03,272
Maybe the best course is
to never tell him.

728
00:26:03,274 --> 00:26:04,423
What happened to not butting in?

729
00:26:04,425 --> 00:26:05,457
Hey, hey, hey.

730
00:26:05,459 --> 00:26:06,959
People change a lot
over seven years.

731
00:26:06,961 --> 00:26:08,927
You don't even
know Drew anymore.

732
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:11,630
He might not be
this sweet baseball player

733
00:26:11,632 --> 00:26:13,348
from St. Louis. He may be

734
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,217
a danger.

735
00:26:15,219 --> 00:26:17,386
How do you know
he's from St. Louis?

736
00:26:17,388 --> 00:26:19,304
Um...

737
00:26:19,306 --> 00:26:20,522
You looked into him?

738
00:26:20,524 --> 00:26:22,274
Yeah, we did,
and be thankful that we did,

739
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:23,892
because he has a conviction
for battery.

740
00:26:23,894 --> 00:26:25,811
“We”?

741
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,313
That's it.
Paige. Paige.

742
00:26:28,315 --> 00:26:29,481
No, no.
No, hold on.

743
00:26:29,483 --> 00:26:30,599
Paige.

744
00:26:30,601 --> 00:26:32,534
Hey!

745
00:26:32,536 --> 00:26:34,737
Listen up.

746
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,457
I don't remember any of you
in the delivery room with me,

747
00:26:38,459 --> 00:26:41,543
or at the E.R. when Ralph
had whooping cough,

748
00:26:41,545 --> 00:26:44,663
or at a single PTA meeting,
but somehow you all

749
00:26:44,665 --> 00:26:45,881
have an equal vote.

750
00:26:45,883 --> 00:26:47,299
Hell, no.

751
00:26:47,301 --> 00:26:48,383
<font color="#808080">SYLVESTER:</font>
We were just worried.

752
00:26:48,385 --> 00:26:49,802
We love Ralph.

753
00:26:49,804 --> 00:26:51,887
We're only trying to
properly analyze the situation.

754
00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:53,806
This isn't an
analytical issue.

755
00:26:53,808 --> 00:26:55,174
It's emotional,

756
00:26:55,176 --> 00:26:56,475
which means you're ill-equipped.

757
00:26:56,477 --> 00:26:58,093
You're too involved.

758
00:26:58,095 --> 00:26:59,511
You are not Ralph's father,

759
00:26:59,513 --> 00:27:01,346
and whether he meets his dad
is my decision.

760
00:27:01,348 --> 00:27:02,514
<font color="#808080">SYLVESTER:</font>
Holy smokes!

00:27:03,851 --> 00:27:04,933
It's Percy, guys.

763
00:27:04,935 --> 00:27:06,518
I tracked his IM handle.

764
00:27:07,138 --> 00:27:08,437
Turn the webcam light off

765
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:09,738
so the Russians can't see it.

766
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,356
Start recording.
Oh, God.

771
00:27:21,118 --> 00:27:22,251
Look at it.

772
00:27:22,253 --> 00:27:23,702
The polypropylene film

773
00:27:23,704 --> 00:27:26,171
is vibrating from the sound
waves of the convict shouting.

774
00:27:26,173 --> 00:27:27,790
I know what you're thinking.
I think we all do.

775
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:30,542
I'll prep
the wave imaging software.

776
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,563
Where are all the chips?

777
00:27:34,565 --> 00:27:36,999
I replaced them with healthier choices.
<font color="#808080">TOBY:</font> Okay.

until I know
what the hell's going on.

783
00:27:44,141 --> 00:27:46,191
Russians, from a historical
genetic standpoint,

784
00:27:46,193 --> 00:27:48,694
have more elastic soft tissue
from folic acid deficiency.

785
00:27:48,696 --> 00:27:50,062
A thousand years of vodka
and cigarettes

786
00:27:50,064 --> 00:27:51,363
will do that to you.

787

The result is long vocal cords
and deep voices.

788
00:27:54,235 --> 00:27:55,400
You're our closest vocal match.

789
00:27:55,402 --> 00:27:57,186
You'll say the phonetic alphabet

790
00:27:57,188 --> 00:27:58,403
near that bag,

791
00:27:58,405 --> 00:28:00,239
and these sensors will record

792
00:28:00,241 --> 00:28:03,075
the ripple waves on the bag
that correspond with each sound.

793
00:28:03,077 --> 00:28:04,793
<font color="#808080">WALTER:</font> Now, we'll compare
them to the waves

794
00:28:04,795 --> 00:28:06,628
Sylvester's software
picks up from the film

795
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,163
on Percy's bag.

796
00:28:08,165 --> 00:28:10,082
And when the waves match,
we'll know the sound

797
00:28:10,084 --> 00:28:11,750
being said on film

798
00:28:11,752 --> 00:28:13,135
even though we can't hear it.

799
00:28:13,137 --> 00:28:14,369
You got it?

800
00:28:14,371 --> 00:28:15,470
Does it really matter?

801
00:28:15,472 --> 00:28:17,506
No. Now start.

802
00:28:17,508 --> 00:28:19,091
A.

803
00:28:19,093 --> 00:28:20,509
B.

804
00:28:20,511 --> 00:28:23,095
C.

805
00:28:23,097 --> 00:28:24,396
What are you doing?

806
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:25,764
It's not ABC, it's phonetics.

807
00:28:25,766 --> 00:28:27,733
Ah-A-eh, B-beh-buh, like that.

808
00:28:27,735 --> 00:28:29,368
All right, take it easy.

809
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,187
It's my first time yelling
at a bag of chips.

810
00:28:32,189 --> 00:28:33,522
A.

811
00:28:33,524 --> 00:28:34,573
Ah, eh.

812
00:28:34,575 --> 00:28:36,341
<font color="#808080">TOBY:</font>
Good job, Cabe.

813
00:28:36,343 --> 00:28:37,609
It's working; keep going.

814
00:28:37,611 --> 00:28:39,945
B, buh...
A moment while Cabe finishes up?

815
00:28:39,947 --> 00:28:41,113
Yeah.

816
00:28:41,115 --> 00:28:42,614
C.

817
00:28:42,616 --> 00:28:43,616
Uh...

818
00:28:43,617 --> 00:28:45,784
Not that I need to explain
anything to you,

819
00:28:45,786 --> 00:28:48,203
but Drew was pitching in Toledo,
and he nailed a batter

820
00:28:48,205 --> 00:28:49,538
who had homered off him earlier.

821
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,789
He broke the guy's forearm.

822
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:52,791
Prosecutors brought
charges to get some press,

823
00:28:52,793 --> 00:28:54,176
and Drew took a plea.

824
00:28:54,178 --> 00:28:55,627
That's the battery charge.

825
00:28:55,629 --> 00:28:58,347
I'm a little overprotective
of Ralph,

826
00:28:58,349 --> 00:29:00,632
which I'm sure you understand.

827
00:29:00,634 --> 00:29:02,801
Look, for what's it worth,
I am gonna tell Drew no.

828
00:29:02,803 --> 00:29:05,020
I think it's too confusing
for Ralph right now.

829
00:29:05,022 --> 00:29:06,555
Maybe when he's older.

830
00:29:06,557 --> 00:29:08,190
It's your decision.

831
00:29:08,192 --> 00:29:09,274
<font color="#808080">SYLVESTER:</font>
The software matched

832
00:29:09,276 --> 00:29:10,559
Cabe's waves to the waves

833
00:29:10,561 --> 00:29:12,978
on Percy's bag.

834
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,946
It couldn't pick up everything,

835
00:29:13,948 --> 00:29:16,481
but we got an “S,” an “O”,

836
00:29:16,483 --> 00:29:18,984
a “C,” a “K”.

837
00:29:18,986 --> 00:29:20,819
“Sock.”

838
00:29:20,821 --> 00:29:22,571
“Change.”

839
00:29:22,573 --> 00:29:24,122
“Sock change.”

840
00:29:24,124 --> 00:29:25,707
What the hell does that mean?
Wait.

841
00:29:25,709 --> 00:29:27,826
Percy's election code
took advantage

842
00:29:27,828 --> 00:29:30,379
of a tenth of a second gap
in vote reporting,

843
00:29:30,381 --> 00:29:33,832
and the cons are forcing him
to change it to siphon money.

844
00:29:33,834 --> 00:29:37,135
Could he be tweaking it to
exploit the split-second gap

845
00:29:37,137 --> 00:29:41,173
from when a stock price is set
to when it's publicly posted?

846
00:29:41,175 --> 00:29:42,641
Sock change, stock exchange.

847
00:29:42,643 --> 00:29:44,009
Okay,

848
00:29:44,011 --> 00:29:47,562
if this virus code gets uploaded
to the stock exchange server...

849
00:29:47,564 --> 00:29:49,431
They could trade stocks on price
data before anybody has it.

850
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:50,682
They could make billions

851
00:29:50,684 --> 00:29:52,184
with no one ever knowing,

852
00:29:52,186 --> 00:29:53,186
but why do all this now?

853
00:29:53,187 --> 00:29:54,686
Quick Google
on the exchange software

854
00:29:54,688 --> 00:29:57,990
shows a major upgrade
for next month.

855
00:29:57,992 --> 00:30:00,993
Percy's code wouldn't work
when that happened.

856
00:30:00,995 --> 00:30:02,911
No one who's planning
something like this

857
00:30:02,913 --> 00:30:04,079
leaves witnesses behind.

858
00:30:04,081 --> 00:30:06,748
Percy is dead the minute
he finishes that code.

859
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,650
He needs to know we found him.

860
00:30:08,652 --> 00:30:09,735
The Russkies ain't looking.

861
00:30:09,737 --> 00:30:11,086
Flash that cam light.

862
00:30:11,705 --> 00:30:14,506
<font color="#808080">TOBY:</font>
There.

863
00:30:14,508 --> 00:30:15,791
His eyes locked in on the light.

864
00:30:15,793 --> 00:30:17,876
They're not looking,
you jackass.

865
00:30:17,878 --> 00:30:20,045
Tell us where you are.

866
00:30:25,936 --> 00:30:28,103
Sweet baby Jane,
is that Morse code?

867
00:30:28,105 --> 00:30:29,137
You know Morse code?

868
00:30:29,139 --> 00:30:30,772
How old are<i> you?</i>

869
00:30:30,774 --> 00:30:34,109
Vandekarp...

870
00:30:34,111 --> 00:30:35,777
Farm.

871
00:30:35,779 --> 00:30:38,230
Building “S”!

872
00:30:38,232 --> 00:30:39,232
Let's go.

873
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:41,783
<font color="#D900D9">(phone rings)</font>
Hold a beat.

874
00:30:41,785 --> 00:30:44,903
Just got a text from
the Treasury Department.

875
00:30:44,905 --> 00:30:46,621
They ran a trace
on that foreign account.

876
00:30:46,623 --> 00:30:49,541
It's only in Percy's name.

877
00:30:49,543 --> 00:30:51,910
What does that mean?
It means that Percy was planning

878
00:30:51,912 --> 00:30:53,628
on ripping off the Russians
this whole time.

879
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,831
He's not as innocent
as we thought.

880
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:57,215
<font color="#808080">TOBY:</font>
Percy's ingenious.

881
00:30:57,217 --> 00:31:00,585
He has a code that can steal
billions with no one knowing,

882
00:31:00,587 --> 00:31:01,920
but in a month it's useless,

883
00:31:01,922 --> 00:31:04,256
so he knows he has to break
out of prison now,

884
00:31:04,258 --> 00:31:05,590
but he doesn't have
the wherewithal

885
00:31:05,592 --> 00:31:08,510
to get a phone smuggled in,
a getaway car, a safe house.

886
00:31:08,512 --> 00:31:10,462
He needs the Russians.

887
00:31:10,464 --> 00:31:12,147
So he breaks out
with them,

888
00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:13,598
sets up his
get-rich-quick scheme,

889
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,067
and figures
he'll just do something

890
00:31:15,069 --> 00:31:16,184
to get them all busted.

891
00:31:16,186 --> 00:31:18,687
Like stick a screw in the tire
of the getaway ride.

892
00:31:18,689 --> 00:31:20,439
Enough to get the cops
on their trail.

893
00:31:20,441 --> 00:31:22,107
We played
right into his hands.

894
00:31:22,109 --> 00:31:23,859
Once he gets caught,
he plays innocent,

895
00:31:23,861 --> 00:31:25,243
says he was forced to run,

896
00:31:25,245 --> 00:31:26,745
maybe gets an extra year.

897
00:31:26,747 --> 00:31:28,447
He gets out,

898
00:31:28,449 --> 00:31:29,998
he's got a fortune overseas.

899
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,500
But his plan was to be captured,

900
00:31:31,502 --> 00:31:33,251
not almost captured.

901
00:31:33,253 --> 00:31:36,004
So after we almost nabbed him
at the safe house,

902
00:31:36,006 --> 00:31:37,839
the Russians knew
he tipped us off.

903
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:40,375
They beat the truth out of him,

904
00:31:40,377 --> 00:31:42,177
and now his last act on earth

905
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:44,129
is gonna be to make
those guys rich.

906
00:31:44,131 --> 00:31:46,965
Walter, does that
sound right to you?

907
00:31:52,139 --> 00:31:54,890
<font color="#808080">CABE:</font> Walter,
are you still there, son?

908

909
00:31:58,395 --> 00:32:00,195
not aid packages.

00:32:00,197 --> 00:32:01,980
It'll kill thousands

911
00:32:01,982 --> 00:32:04,116
I didn't know that was
the endgame, son.

912
00:32:04,118 --> 00:32:05,400
I swear.

913
00:32:09,656 --> 00:32:11,490
Yeah, it sounds right to me.

914
00:32:11,492 --> 00:32:13,492
He deceived us.

915
00:32:13,494 --> 00:32:14,826
He took advantage of us.

916
00:32:14,828 --> 00:32:17,462
Everything that normals
usually do to geniuses.

917
00:32:17,464 --> 00:32:20,632
I thought
he was one of us.

918
00:32:20,634 --> 00:32:22,717
I want to nail this guy.

919
00:32:29,709 --> 00:32:31,277
<font color="#808080">CABE:</font> Homeland will come in
from the south

920
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:33,983
to Building “S.” Your
men will hit the north.

921
00:32:34,932 --> 00:32:37,721
It's a silent maneuver in case
they have police scanners.

922
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,405
So comms off.

923
00:32:39,407 --> 00:32:41,674
We'll drive halfway there,
then we'll hoof it

924
00:32:41,676 --> 00:32:43,142
so they don't
hear our approach.

925
00:32:43,144 --> 00:32:45,027
Copy that.

926
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:50,232
Target's 800 yards on
the other side of the compound.

927
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:51,533
So you'll be safe here.

928
00:32:51,535 --> 00:32:53,569
See you when
we got the bad guys.

929
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:54,870
My team, with me!

930
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:57,039
It looks like Percy's
getting close to finishing

931
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,124
that code for them.

932
00:32:59,126 --> 00:33:00,542
He's Morse-coding again.

933
00:33:00,544 --> 00:33:05,047
“Near... done.

934
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:06,131
Selp?”

935
00:33:06,133 --> 00:33:07,216
He means “help.”

936
00:33:07,968 --> 00:33:09,418
Oh, my God, “S” is three dots;

937
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,886
“H” is four dots.

938
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:12,971
I sent Cabe to Building “S”
instead of Building “H”!

939
00:33:12,973 --> 00:33:14,973
Oh...
Hey, Cabe!

940
00:33:14,975 --> 00:33:17,209
He's going to the wrong side
of the compound.

941
00:33:17,211 --> 00:33:17,943
Call him.

942
00:33:17,945 --> 00:33:18,927
We can't.

943
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:20,062
The comms are off.

944
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:21,764
Once Percy sends that code
to the stock exchange,

945
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:22,731
he's as good as dead.

946
00:33:22,733 --> 00:33:24,316
We gotta get him out of there.

947
00:33:24,318 --> 00:33:26,352
We're not putting
ourselves in danger

948
00:33:26,354 --> 00:33:28,103
for someone who's been
playing us this whole time.

949
00:33:28,105 --> 00:33:29,488
<font color="#808080">WALTER:</font>
We're gonna save him

950
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:30,656
because I want the satisfaction

951
00:33:30,658 --> 00:33:32,107
of looking him in the eyes
when he's cuffed.

952
00:33:32,109 --> 00:33:34,326
Let him know:
the people he manipulated?

953
00:33:34,328 --> 00:33:36,328
They're the ones who are
sending him back inside.

954
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,497
How do we rescue a man
being held by armed Russians

955
00:33:38,499 --> 00:33:40,199
in an abandoned dairy farm
outside Camarillo?

956
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:41,583
<font color="#808080">TOBY:</font> You have no idea
how many times

957
00:33:41,585 --> 00:33:42,951
I've been asked that question.

958
00:33:44,955 --> 00:33:46,922
Guys, Building “H” is close.

959
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:48,290
Follow me, follow me.

960
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:57,683
Okay, Happy, see if you can get
any gas out of that tractor.

961
00:33:57,685 --> 00:34:00,352
Paige...

962
00:34:00,354 --> 00:34:02,104
find her something
to collect it in.

963
00:34:07,144 --> 00:34:08,143
You got time to fill me in?

964
00:34:08,145 --> 00:34:10,696
The farm was built
in the '20s.

965
00:34:10,698 --> 00:34:13,065
Means old knob
and tube wiring,

966
00:34:13,067 --> 00:34:14,133
so no grounding conductor.

967
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,535
Now, if I target concentrated

968
00:34:16,537 --> 00:34:19,538
micro-frequency waves--
which this remote emits--

969
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,156
to the second floor
circuit breaker,

970
00:34:21,158 --> 00:34:22,791
then I can cause it
to short out.

971
00:34:22,793 --> 00:34:24,326
But I will need
an accelerant.

972
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:25,577
Which I almost
have for you.

973
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:26,995
Even if we get
a fire going

974
00:34:26,997 --> 00:34:29,915
to flush them out,
they have guns.

975
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:31,750
Then so will we.
I have an idea.

976
00:34:34,221 --> 00:34:35,721
Doc,

977
00:34:35,723 --> 00:34:37,172
come with me
and bring your laptop.

978
00:34:41,095 --> 00:34:42,261
<font color="#808080">WALTER:</font>
Okay.

979
00:34:42,263 --> 00:34:44,263
I should be getting
some short-circuiting

980
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:46,348
and smoke through
the circuit breaker by now.

981
00:34:48,636 --> 00:34:50,235
Can't take my hands
off the remote control,

982
00:34:50,237 --> 00:34:51,904
so I'm gonna need
one of you to throw

983
00:34:51,906 --> 00:34:53,071
that accelerant
through the window.

984
00:34:53,073 --> 00:34:54,823
Hurry.
Me?

985
00:34:54,825 --> 00:34:56,358
I couldn't hit a donkey's ass
with a banjo.

986
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,360
You played baseball.

987
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:58,527
I played right field.

988
00:35:04,718 --> 00:35:05,851
Are you serious?

989
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,219
As a Peek Frean.

990
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:09,855
Please.

991
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,006
You can just let me go.

992
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,458
No one will know.

993
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,159
Shut up and finish!

994
00:35:14,161 --> 00:35:15,294
I need that accelerant.

995
00:35:15,296 --> 00:35:17,379
Sylvester, this is your
chance to show your dad

996
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:18,864
he was wrong to stick
you in right field.

997
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,132

00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,631
for a red truck
with a dented fender.

1103
00:39:47,633 --> 00:39:50,467
We have both spent
our lives waiting

1104
00:39:50,469 --> 00:39:51,835
for someone to come home.

1105
00:39:51,837 --> 00:39:53,270
Just to know

1106
00:39:53,272 --> 00:39:55,639
we still matter.

1107
00:39:55,641 --> 00:39:57,307
So if there's even a chance

1108
00:39:57,309 --> 00:39:58,859
you can end what
Ralph's going through,

1109
00:39:58,861 --> 00:40:00,193
then you do it.

1110
00:40:00,195 --> 00:40:03,797
That's it; I'm done.

1111
00:40:08,654 --> 00:40:09,870
Hey.
Hey.

1112
00:40:12,491 --> 00:40:13,957
You're going to let him
meet Ralph.

1113
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:14,959
No.

1114
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,793
I'm going to let
Ralph meet him.

1115
00:40:16,795 --> 00:40:18,078
I'm doing it for my son.

1116
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,296
Not Drew.

1117
00:40:19,298 --> 00:40:20,830
You're going to tell him
Ralph's a genius.

1118
00:40:20,832 --> 00:40:21,998
That carries risk.

1119
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,084
If Drew's going to have

1120
00:40:24,086 --> 00:40:26,086
a relationship with his son,

1121
00:40:26,088 --> 00:40:27,888
he needs to know who he is.

1122
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:30,590
And Ralph's mind
is one of the things

1123
00:40:30,592 --> 00:40:31,641
that makes him special.

1124
00:40:31,643 --> 00:40:34,311
Moving forward,
no more interfering.

1125
00:40:35,681 --> 00:40:38,815
But if Ralph
does need me...

1126
00:40:38,817 --> 00:40:40,483
I will be
close by.

1127
00:40:51,947 --> 00:40:53,113
Excuse me.

1128
00:40:53,115 --> 00:40:54,414
Yeah?

1129
00:40:54,416 --> 00:40:56,950
I, uh, was wondering
if you're hiring.

1130
00:40:56,952 --> 00:40:58,034
Sorry.

1131
00:40:58,036 --> 00:40:59,836
I'm barely keeping this
place afloat myself.

1132
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:02,172
Okay.

1133
00:41:02,174 --> 00:41:03,373
Thanks.

1134
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:05,926
It's tough out there, huh?

1135
00:41:05,928 --> 00:41:07,510
Been outta
work long?

1136
00:41:07,512 --> 00:41:08,512
No.

1137
00:41:08,513 --> 00:41:10,847
I got a job.

1138
00:41:10,849 --> 00:41:14,134
It's just intense at times.

1139
00:41:14,136 --> 00:41:16,019
Wrenching relaxes me.

1140
00:41:16,021 --> 00:41:17,387
Me, too.

1141
00:41:17,389 --> 00:41:18,521
Okay...

1142
00:41:18,523 --> 00:41:20,056
Take it easy.

1143
00:41:35,073 --> 00:41:36,740
Hey...
Yeah?

1144
00:41:36,742 --> 00:41:39,075
You know, you can,
uh, save some time

1145
00:41:39,077 --> 00:41:41,211
if you come in underneath
the oil gasket.

1146
00:41:41,213 --> 00:41:43,413
Is that right?

1147
00:41:43,415 --> 00:41:44,864
You mind?

1148
00:41:44,866 --> 00:41:46,333
No.

1149
00:41:46,335 --> 00:41:48,418
Why don't you go ahead?

1150
00:41:52,224 --> 00:41:53,890
Little light?
Yeah.

1151
00:41:56,812 --> 00:41:58,011
You're good.

1152
00:41:58,013 --> 00:41:59,229
Thanks.

1153
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:06,736
Hey...

1154
00:42:09,858 --> 00:42:11,024
Hi, Ralph.

1155
00:42:11,026 --> 00:42:12,492
Want to sit?

1156
00:42:18,917 --> 00:42:20,834
I'm really happy
to see you again.

1157
00:42:36,685 --> 00:42:38,852
<font color="#808080">WALTER:</font> How'd you know
I'd be here?

1158
00:42:38,854 --> 00:42:41,104
You look after the kid,

1159
00:42:41,106 --> 00:42:42,439
I'll look after you.

1160
00:42:42,441 --> 00:42:44,724
Just like I used to.

1161
00:42:44,726 --> 00:42:47,360
That's how this is gonna work.

1162
00:42:47,362 --> 00:42:48,561
Okay?

1163
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,149
Okay.

1164
00:42:53,151 --> 00:42:55,235
Peek Frean?
