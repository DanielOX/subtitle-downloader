1
00:00:05,307 --> 00:00:06,965
<i>My name is Walter O'Brien.</i>

2
00:00:06,967 --> 00:00:11,375
<i>I have the fourth highest IQ</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

3
00:00:11,377 --> 00:00:13,124
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

4
00:00:13,426 --> 00:00:16,051
<i>When I was 11, the FBI</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking NASA</i>

5
00:00:16,053 --> 00:00:18,791
<i>to get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

6
00:00:18,793 --> 00:00:21,012
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

7
00:00:21,014 --> 00:00:22,487
<i>tackling worldwide threats</i>

8
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:23,989
<i>only we can solve.</i>

9
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:25,729
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

10
00:00:25,731 --> 00:00:27,498
<i>Sylvester's a human calculator.</i>

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,871
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

12
00:00:29,873 --> 00:00:32,139
<i>Agent Cabe Gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

13
00:00:32,141 --> 00:00:34,336
<i>And Paige?</i>
<i>Well, Paige isn't like us.</i>

14
00:00:34,338 --> 00:00:36,844
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

15
00:00:36,846 --> 00:00:39,409
<i>while we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

16
00:00:39,411 --> 00:00:41,816
<i>Together, we are Scorpion.</i>

17
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:55,282
I wrote it for you.

18
00:00:55,284 --> 00:00:57,219
It's so beautiful.

19
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,319
I have an electro-plasmic
Continuum Fingerboard.

20
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:06,148
Happy helped me build it.

21
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:10,645
Does Happy know about...

22
00:01:10,647 --> 00:01:13,176
Us? In the broadest of terms.

23
00:01:13,178 --> 00:01:16,013
So pretty much everyone
in the garage but my brother.

24
00:01:16,015 --> 00:01:18,750
You said you want to tell him
yourself, but you know

25
00:01:18,752 --> 00:01:20,820
Walter comes here
every Friday, right?

26
00:01:20,822 --> 00:01:22,346
He sees
one Super Fun Guy comic,

27
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:25,556
he is going to know that we've
been spending time together.

28
00:01:25,558 --> 00:01:27,522
So I'll just bring them all
to my apartment,

29
00:01:27,524 --> 00:01:29,855
and you can read them there.

30
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:32,388
Yeah, I think I'm gonna
be leaving here less and less.

31
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,493
I thought
we were thinking positive.

32
00:01:33,495 --> 00:01:34,622
Especially
with Walter's research,

33
00:01:34,624 --> 00:01:36,123
you still got a good chance.

34
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:41,157
This morning I was told
that I won't get my braces off.

35
00:01:42,956 --> 00:01:47,421
I'm never gonna walk
without them again.

36
00:01:47,423 --> 00:01:50,557
I'm never gonna dance again.

37
00:01:50,559 --> 00:01:51,989
Ugh, but, hey...

38
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:54,426
I have no time for regrets

39
00:01:54,428 --> 00:01:57,528
and no time for secrets.

40
00:01:59,098 --> 00:02:01,431
Don't be nervous.

41
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:03,862
He's gonna be fine with it.

42
00:02:03,864 --> 00:02:05,502
You're right.

43
00:02:05,504 --> 00:02:07,994
I will find
the right time and...

44
00:02:07,996 --> 00:02:10,064
I will tell him.

45
00:02:12,168 --> 00:02:14,797
Everybody! By the monitors!

46
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:15,992
Uh, hey...

47
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:19,232
Yeah, you... you look like
you're about to say something.

48
00:02:19,404 --> 00:02:20,368
No? Okay, great.

49
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,966
Everybody by the monitors.

50
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,005
I'm Lorraine Arroyo.

51
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:29,069
Hey, that's the sign.

52
00:02:29,071 --> 00:02:31,046
We had a chance to sit down
with the leader

53
00:02:31,048 --> 00:02:33,614
and founder
of this remarkable team,

54
00:02:33,616 --> 00:02:35,645
Walter O'Brien.

55
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:36,410
That's the garage.

56
00:02:36,434 --> 00:02:38,676
I don't think it's a
coincidence, Sylvester.

57
00:02:38,718 --> 00:02:41,651
197 IQ,
statistically one of only

58
00:02:41,653 --> 00:02:42,955
four people on Earth.

59
00:02:42,957 --> 00:02:45,051
Are you just always thinking
of amazing things?

60
00:02:45,053 --> 00:02:46,619
When did you do a TV interview?

61
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:47,891
Well, I'm involved

62
00:02:47,893 --> 00:02:49,795
in many projects simultaneously.

63
00:02:49,797 --> 00:02:52,626
But when I use my intelligence
for the greater good,

64
00:02:52,628 --> 00:02:55,665
that's when I'm most fulfilled.

65
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,264
This is the dramatic footage

66
00:02:58,266 --> 00:02:59,936
<i>of Walter O'Brien</i>
<i>saving the life</i>

67
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:02,104
<i>of a young boy who'd been</i>
<i>trapped in a sinkhole</i>

68
00:03:02,106 --> 00:03:03,904
on Zuma Beach.

69
00:03:03,906 --> 00:03:06,671
I remember
all of us being there.

70
00:03:06,673 --> 00:03:08,773
This is the jack that I used
to free the boy's foot.

71
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:10,876
- The jack I built.
- Is it fair to say

72
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:13,042
that boy was saved by genius?

73
00:03:13,044 --> 00:03:14,338
Absolutely.

74
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,145
No. He was saved
by four geniuses.

75
00:03:17,147 --> 00:03:19,112
And Cabe and Paige.

76
00:03:19,114 --> 00:03:20,175
Is that arm
a little sore

77
00:03:20,177 --> 00:03:21,679
from patting yourself
on the back?

78
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:23,614
But as brilliant
as he is, O'Brien chooses

79
00:03:23,616 --> 00:03:27,212
to surround himself with other
highly gifted intellects.

80
00:03:27,214 --> 00:03:29,251
Less so than himself, of course.

81
00:03:29,253 --> 00:03:31,682
Math whiz Sylvester Dodd...

82
00:03:31,684 --> 00:03:33,480
Statistical theoretician.
Tobias Curtis,

83
00:03:33,482 --> 00:03:34,983
- psychologist...
- Psychiatrist.

84
00:03:34,985 --> 00:03:36,550
Harvard-trained.
master fabricator

85
00:03:36,552 --> 00:03:39,254
and genius electrical engineer,

86
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:42,326
Paige Dineen; and lastly,

87
00:03:42,328 --> 00:03:44,925
what O'Brien termed
the team's supernanny,

88
00:03:44,927 --> 00:03:46,197
Happy Quinn.

89
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:51,030
Pardon me while I go bury
my head in the dirt.

90
00:03:51,032 --> 00:03:53,565
Is it that bad
being mistaken for me?

91
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,069
Although "supernanny" does sound
like I change diapers.

92
00:03:56,071 --> 00:03:58,140
We're gonna be flooded
with work.

93
00:03:58,142 --> 00:03:59,939
Given your astronomical IQ,
I didn't think it was necessary

94
00:03:59,941 --> 00:04:01,939
to discuss the difference
between a psychologist

95
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,507
and an M.D.

96
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,514
I told them
you were a psychiatrist

97
00:04:05,516 --> 00:04:06,944
and where
you trained.

98
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:09,247
It just got lost in translation.

99
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,279
A few things.

100
00:04:10,281 --> 00:04:12,751
They're TV reporters.

101
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,246
You have to expect
some mild inaccuracies.

102
00:04:14,248 --> 00:04:16,178
Can no one see the greater good
in this scenario?

103
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,046
It's great for the team.

104
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:20,212
It's great for you.

105
00:04:20,214 --> 00:04:22,346
Your qualifications
were stated perfectly,

106
00:04:22,348 --> 00:04:25,545
and the entire report was
a firmly gripped stroke

107
00:04:25,547 --> 00:04:28,216
of your narcissistic egomania.

108
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:33,921
You didn't

109
00:04:33,923 --> 00:04:35,625
tell them.
You didn't include them.

110
00:04:35,627 --> 00:04:37,329
They only asked to talk to me.

111
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:39,328
I-I didn't even think
to ask you guys.

112
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,624
Exactly!

113
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:41,961
A fresh shovelful

114
00:04:41,963 --> 00:04:43,464
of narcissistic egomania
onto the pile.

115
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:45,262
I did my job.

116
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,964
I got media coverage
for the team.

117
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:49,100
This is childish!

118
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:50,131
Hey!

119
00:04:54,006 --> 00:04:55,436
We got a case.

120
00:04:55,438 --> 00:04:57,275
That is Richard Elia.

121
00:04:57,277 --> 00:04:59,411
Billionaire
tech mogul.

122
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:01,243
Yeah, I know who he is.

123
00:05:01,245 --> 00:05:05,610
And his first impression
of us is that we're idiots.

124
00:05:05,612 --> 00:05:07,283
My daughter Zoe.

125
00:05:07,285 --> 00:05:10,821
10 days ago, she was kidnapped
by the La Plaga cartel in Mexico

126
00:05:10,823 --> 00:05:12,726
while on a journalism
assignment.

127
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:14,296
They're an emerging drug gang.

128
00:05:14,298 --> 00:05:16,001
Particularly violent.

129
00:05:16,003 --> 00:05:17,130
They've killed before.

130
00:05:17,132 --> 00:05:18,738
They left heads
in the street.

131
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,937
I'm sorry.

132
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:21,136
They're modern.

133
00:05:21,138 --> 00:05:22,367
Tech savvy.

134
00:05:22,369 --> 00:05:24,206
They like to show off
their exploits-- murders--

135
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,070
to other cartels
via social media.

136
00:05:26,072 --> 00:05:27,438
That's Advertising 101.

137
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,678
New kids on
the block want

138
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,343
to make it known that
they mean business.

139
00:05:30,345 --> 00:05:31,414
Publicity whores.

140
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,542
Been seeing a lot
of that lately.

141
00:05:33,544 --> 00:05:34,983
How did an heiress
cross those guys?

142
00:05:34,985 --> 00:05:38,286
It's trite,
but when Zoe turned 20,

143
00:05:38,288 --> 00:05:40,454
she started saying that
I was a capitalist fascist

144
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:41,718
and guys like me

145
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,590
were the source of
all the world's ills.

146
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:45,054
And we didn't speak for months.

147
00:05:45,056 --> 00:05:46,862
Ten days ago,
I get a call from her editor

148
00:05:46,864 --> 00:05:48,326
saying she's down in Mexico,

149
00:05:48,328 --> 00:05:51,094
wants to blow the lid
off this big drug cartel.

150
00:05:51,096 --> 00:05:52,967
You want us to find her?

151
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:54,934
In drug cartel territory?

152
00:05:54,936 --> 00:05:58,103
There are ongoing,
very sensitive

153
00:05:58,105 --> 00:06:00,710
border sovereignty talks
between the U.S. and Mexico.

154
00:06:00,712 --> 00:06:02,574
The last thing the State wants

155
00:06:02,576 --> 00:06:04,647
is us sending in a paramilitary
group to rescue a citizen.

156
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:07,016
Well, they must know
who you are.

157
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:08,249
They know who Zoe is.

158
00:06:08,251 --> 00:06:09,953
There must be a substantial
ransom; pay it.

159
00:06:09,955 --> 00:06:12,058
- I did.
- $2 million via wire transfer.

160
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,994
As soon as they got it,

161
00:06:13,996 --> 00:06:15,426
they called it a "down payment."

162
00:06:15,428 --> 00:06:16,731
Then this morning,
they reached out

163
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:18,099
and asked for
another installment,

164
00:06:18,101 --> 00:06:19,996
due in 10 hours, in cash,

165
00:06:19,998 --> 00:06:22,932
delivered to coordinates in
the northwest Mexican desert.

166
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:25,370
I've had my best people working
on tracing their communications

167
00:06:25,372 --> 00:06:26,538
and they hit wall

168
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,706
after wall.

169
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,506
But if you can
just locate her,

170
00:06:29,508 --> 00:06:31,441
even the city that she's in,
I have contractors.

171
00:06:31,443 --> 00:06:32,642
They'll go in and extricate her.

172
00:06:32,644 --> 00:06:34,610
Do you have the, uh,
the wiring instructions

173
00:06:34,612 --> 00:06:36,178
- for the ransom money?
- Yeah.

174
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,178
Can I see it, please?
Thank you.

175
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,481
Sly...
Yeah.

176
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:40,017
If you keep paying it,

177
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:41,384
they'll probably
string you along,

178
00:06:41,386 --> 00:06:43,016
providing "proof of life"
videos of Zoe

179
00:06:43,018 --> 00:06:44,488
in different clothing
and locations.

180
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,390
They'll probably be taken
over the next few days.

181
00:06:46,392 --> 00:06:49,055
The likelihood is that
she'll be killed within a week--

182
00:06:49,057 --> 00:06:50,527
keeping a hostage
is a liability.

183
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:54,798
But there's
no certainty of that.

184
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Yes, of course.

185
00:06:55,801 --> 00:06:57,231
Nothing is, uh, certain.

186
00:06:57,233 --> 00:06:58,503
I did a sweep

187
00:06:58,505 --> 00:06:59,534
of Mr. Elia's bank

188
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:01,197
and traced the routing
and re-routing.

189
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,805
The kidnappers made it
bounce between 15 countries,

190
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:07,342
but I am 97% certain

191
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:08,374
that your daughter

192
00:07:08,376 --> 00:07:10,214
is somewhere near
Culiacan, Mexico.

193
00:07:10,216 --> 00:07:11,742
Oh, my God.

194
00:07:11,744 --> 00:07:13,550
You said they were good.

195
00:07:13,552 --> 00:07:15,087
I'll have my men there
in four hours.

196
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:17,120
You will be well
compensated for this.

197
00:07:17,122 --> 00:07:19,320
Mr. Elia?

198
00:07:19,322 --> 00:07:21,424
Um...

199
00:07:21,426 --> 00:07:22,592
Simply arriving at the airport

200
00:07:22,594 --> 00:07:24,159
will not guarantee
getting your daughter back.

201
00:07:24,161 --> 00:07:25,894
But I may be able to pinpoint

202
00:07:25,896 --> 00:07:27,398
to the location
where she is.

203
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,494
But because of the time crunch,

204
00:07:29,496 --> 00:07:31,366
we'll need to
split up, collect

205
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,671
the necessary technology

206
00:07:32,673 --> 00:07:34,672
and then meet up
back in Culiacan ourselves.

207
00:07:34,674 --> 00:07:35,568
I'm sorry, what?

208
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,472
If you can pinpoint
her location,

209
00:07:37,474 --> 00:07:38,839
I'll double your fee.

210
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:40,606
Walter, can I have
a second, please?

211
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,413
Drug cartel territory?

212
00:07:44,415 --> 00:07:46,580
You trying
to get us decapitated?

213
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:48,610
Or is this the,
uh, opportunity

214
00:07:48,612 --> 00:07:51,081
to dazzle some deep-pocket
tech mogul with rich friends?

215
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,314
Yeah, this would fit in nicely

216
00:07:52,316 --> 00:07:54,280
to your "PR at all costs"
campaign.

217
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:55,918
I have a plan; my plans work.

218
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,981
Because time is
of the essence.

219
00:07:57,983 --> 00:08:00,621
The cartel's expecting payment
in a matter of hours.

220
00:08:00,623 --> 00:08:03,454
If you do not want to assist,
it's your decision, Toby.

221
00:08:03,456 --> 00:08:05,695
Wow, that's it...
your way or the highway?

222
00:08:06,865 --> 00:08:11,091
Walter, that was a local
morning news show.

223
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:13,562
We have to move fast.

224
00:08:13,564 --> 00:08:14,834
What is your answer?

225
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:17,698
How many jets do you have?

226
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,508
Two.

227
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,941
We'll need them both.

228
00:08:20,943 --> 00:08:24,379
And $2 million, in cash.

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,573
Please... don't.

231
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:33,981
It's just a little sunshine.

232
00:08:33,983 --> 00:08:38,483
It's just a little reminder that
we are 36,000 feet in the air.

233
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,514
Explain how this works again.

234
00:08:40,516 --> 00:08:43,223
Well, these holographic strips

235
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:46,560
are a fairly rudimentary
anticounterfeiting measure.

236
00:08:46,562 --> 00:08:48,928
Right now, they are programmed
with information

237
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,165
that only contains
the denomination of the bill.

238
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:55,035
But these strips,
when originally manufactured,

239
00:08:55,037 --> 00:08:58,633
had microscopic
solar cells implanted,

240
00:08:58,635 --> 00:09:00,871
so they were charged
and programmed

241
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,669
with GPS tracking software.

242
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:03,900
It was a secret

243
00:09:03,902 --> 00:09:06,369
government program to
track how money was spent.

244
00:09:06,371 --> 00:09:08,000
We track these strips with GPS,

245
00:09:08,002 --> 00:09:09,597
stick 'em in
Elia's cash,

246
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:11,267
the cartel picks up the money,

247
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:13,530
and then we've got a shot
to track them back to Zoe.

248
00:09:13,532 --> 00:09:14,800
It's a smart
idea, Walter.

249
00:09:14,802 --> 00:09:16,702
Butt kiss much?

250
00:09:16,704 --> 00:09:18,437
Walt,

251
00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:19,869
I have major concerns
that Cabe isn't with us.

252
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,406
Well, he's the only one
who can requisition the strips

253
00:09:22,408 --> 00:09:24,110
from the Treasury Department,
Happy.

254
00:09:24,112 --> 00:09:25,910
He will meet
us an hour

255
00:09:25,912 --> 00:09:27,078
after we arrive,

256
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,213
the Mexican Federales
will escort us into town.

257
00:09:30,215 --> 00:09:32,180
I can handle whatever comes up.

258
00:09:32,182 --> 00:09:34,515
Even gunfire from drug warlords?

259
00:09:34,517 --> 00:09:37,314
We're not going
to encounter that.

260
00:09:37,316 --> 00:09:39,250
We program the strips;

261
00:09:39,252 --> 00:09:40,354
we implant them
into the money;

262
00:09:40,356 --> 00:09:41,922
and then the professionals
track down

263
00:09:41,924 --> 00:09:43,459
the cartel and rescue Zoe.

264
00:09:43,461 --> 00:09:44,459
Done...

265
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:45,827
and done.

266
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:47,491
Perfect. Great idea.

267
00:09:48,532 --> 00:09:49,729
I'll be up front.

268
00:09:49,731 --> 00:09:51,865
So I don't barf.

269
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:54,002
We've started our descent.
Buckle up, everyone,

270
00:09:54,004 --> 00:09:55,900
<i>and we'll be on the ground</i>
<i>in 20 minutes.</i>

271
00:10:00,615 --> 00:10:02,910
La Plaga has really been
consolidating their power

272
00:10:02,912 --> 00:10:04,846
over the past year.

273
00:10:04,848 --> 00:10:06,214
The gang runs rampant

274
00:10:06,216 --> 00:10:07,686
and the population is terrified.

275
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:08,717
For good reason.

276
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:11,156
Fantastic.
I would lay low as best you can.

277
00:10:11,158 --> 00:10:13,587
We will not be handling
any of the dangerous

278
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:15,458
elements
of this operation.

279
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,321
We'll be in the hotel
most of the time.

280
00:10:17,323 --> 00:10:19,122
<i>That's good.</i>

281
00:10:19,124 --> 00:10:20,594
<i>Here we are.</i>

282
00:10:21,396 --> 00:10:23,195
Uh... what is this?

283
00:10:23,197 --> 00:10:24,700
You are ten miles from town.

284
00:10:24,702 --> 00:10:25,964
The bus comes on the hour.

285
00:10:25,966 --> 00:10:27,037
Usually.

286
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,541
Uh... whoa, whoa, whoa!

287
00:10:29,543 --> 00:10:30,637
This is crazy.

288
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:31,677
You can't just leave us here.

289
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,478
This uniform puts
a target on my back--

290
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,446
and on yours,

291
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:35,910
if you are
spotted with me.

292
00:10:35,912 --> 00:10:38,119
Public transportation is safest.

293
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:39,384
Good luck.

294
00:10:42,626 --> 00:10:44,825
Whoa, ho, hold on.
Hold on.

295
00:10:44,827 --> 00:10:46,298
Okay, okay.

296
00:10:53,144 --> 00:10:55,776
Well, you heard him.

297
00:10:55,778 --> 00:10:56,912
It's safer this way.

298
00:10:56,914 --> 00:10:58,049
Unarmed.

299
00:10:58,051 --> 00:10:59,083
Carrying $2 million in cash.

300
00:10:59,085 --> 00:11:00,219
I'd kill us.

301
00:11:00,221 --> 00:11:02,019
Not to mention,
I didn't get a good vibe

302
00:11:02,021 --> 00:11:03,291
from our escort.

303
00:11:03,293 --> 00:11:04,787
I'm pretty sure I picked up
some deceit leakage.

304
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:08,691
Yeah, well, I'm picking up
paranoia leakage.

305
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,595
Looks like things
can't get much worse, huh, boss?

306
00:11:15,965 --> 00:11:18,339
I've been trying to find
the right time

307
00:11:18,341 --> 00:11:19,667
to tell you something.

308
00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:21,172
That's an impossible
and inefficient goal.

309
00:11:21,174 --> 00:11:22,476
If you have something to say,

310
00:11:22,478 --> 00:11:23,940
then say it.

311
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,784
Guys, I don't think
this is the bus.

312
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:30,489
Uh, not good.

313
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:37,296

00:12:24,302 --> 00:12:26,268
He's upset with me
because of Megan.

326
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,635
Or because he just got robbed of
two million dollars at gunpoint.

327
00:12:28,637 --> 00:12:31,403
<i>Si.</i>
A room under O'Brien, <i>por favor.</i>

328
00:12:31,405 --> 00:12:32,875
<i>Un momento.</i>

329
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,242
I did not set up
the federal escort.

330
00:12:36,244 --> 00:12:37,778
We have eight hours
before that money

331
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,176
is supposed to be delivered,
or Zoe's life is over.

332
00:12:40,178 --> 00:12:42,511
So we can fight later?

333
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:44,215
Tabled for now.

334
00:12:44,217 --> 00:12:46,318
Hey, check it out.

335
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,454
Is that the first thing
you think of

336
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:48,655
when you think of Mexico?

337
00:12:48,657 --> 00:12:50,023
The clock making?

338
00:12:50,025 --> 00:12:51,655
<i>Buenos Dias.</i>

339
00:12:51,657 --> 00:12:54,758
I got the GPS strips
and wired us up a car.

340
00:12:57,263 --> 00:12:58,565
Why do you all

341
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:00,661
look like hell?

342
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:02,166
Where's the money bag?

343
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:05,567
You've got to be kidding me.

344
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:07,135
Your Federale, bro.

345
00:13:07,137 --> 00:13:08,543
He's not my Federale.

346
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:10,540
He's fourth-generation CI,
handed down from Homeland.

347
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:12,075
Right. What department
of government do you work for?

348
00:13:12,077 --> 00:13:13,307
The post office?

349
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,411
Can Elia replace the money?

350
00:13:16,413 --> 00:13:18,044
Good luck finding
a bank near here

351
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:20,685
with two million American
dollars in small bills.

352
00:13:20,687 --> 00:13:21,950
Just got off with Elia;
he's devastated,

353
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:23,622
but I convinced him
we can get it done.

354
00:13:23,624 --> 00:13:24,655
Don't make me a liar.

355
00:13:24,657 --> 00:13:25,854
How are we doing
with the wireless?

356
00:13:25,856 --> 00:13:27,126
Just went up.

357
00:13:27,128 --> 00:13:29,230
He also sent a file
to our secure e-mail.

358
00:13:29,232 --> 00:13:30,663
It's a new video of Zoe.
Got it.

359
00:13:30,665 --> 00:13:32,367
Dad...

360
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:34,737
if the money isn't delivered
to the coordinates

361
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:37,168
by 6:00 p.m. tonight...

362
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,503
That's today, in six hours.

363
00:13:38,505 --> 00:13:39,439
We can't get the money in time.

364
00:13:39,441 --> 00:13:40,808
Say it.
No.

365
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,344
Say it.
I won't say that, okay?

366
00:13:42,346 --> 00:13:43,911
He knows what executed means.
I don't need--

367
00:13:43,913 --> 00:13:45,279
Say it, damn it,
or I'll kill you.

368
00:13:47,385 --> 00:13:50,279
They said they'll send me home
in pieces.

369
00:13:50,281 --> 00:13:51,846
Wait, if we can trace
the point of origin

370
00:13:51,848 --> 00:13:53,054
of the file they sent Elia,

371
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:54,781
maybe we'll have the whereabouts

372
00:13:54,783 --> 00:13:56,557
of their headquarters.

373
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:57,822
And then we can do the recon.

374
00:13:57,824 --> 00:13:58,989
If we can locate her,

375
00:13:58,991 --> 00:14:00,692
Elia's contractors
can extract her.

376
00:14:00,694 --> 00:14:02,090
They're due here in three hours.

377
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,691
Ah, whatever server
this e-mail was sent from

378
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:06,628
has a 30-point encryption
key that changes

379
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,829
every three minutes.

380
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:09,101
So somehow we got to come up

381
00:14:09,103 --> 00:14:10,733
with the correct 30 numbers
in three minutes

382
00:14:10,735 --> 00:14:12,701
or it resets and we start over?

383
00:14:12,703 --> 00:14:14,203
You're really learning.

384
00:14:14,205 --> 00:14:15,833
I won't say that, okay?
He knows what executed means...

385
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:17,105
Ah, Sylvester,

386
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:19,041
that audio is boring
a slow hole into my brain.

387
00:14:19,043 --> 00:14:20,440
But I...
But nothing.

388
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,503
Please, just change it.

389
00:14:21,505 --> 00:14:22,671
Thank you.
You're right.

390
00:14:22,673 --> 00:14:24,174
He might be upset with you.

391
00:14:24,176 --> 00:14:27,172
He's gonna have to suck it up,
because I know this bird.

392
00:14:27,174 --> 00:14:30,012
Aix sponsa, the wood duck,
here on its winter migration.

393
00:14:30,014 --> 00:14:31,212
Uh-huh.

394
00:14:31,214 --> 00:14:32,882
Well, it feeds on algae

395
00:14:32,884 --> 00:14:34,714
specific to a shallow marsh,

396
00:14:34,716 --> 00:14:36,910
but average flock size dictates
that the marsh

397
00:14:36,912 --> 00:14:40,881
needs to be at least 60 hectares
to be a proper feeding ground.

398
00:14:40,883 --> 00:14:42,814
Sylvester, you're insane.

399
00:14:44,111 --> 00:14:45,308
The Aix sponsa's feeding ground

400
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,548
can be as little as 47 hectares.

401
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,684
60 is way on the high side.

402
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,011
You know this bird, too?

403
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,179
Not personally.

404
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,082
The point is how many
shallow marshes

405
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:53,417
are there in this general area

406
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:55,922
between 47 and 60 hectares.

407
00:14:55,924 --> 00:14:57,418
What we need now

408
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,924
is satellite imagery.

409
00:14:58,926 --> 00:15:00,797
Enjoy that coattail ride,
O'Brien,

410
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,261
because Sly figured that one out.
Really?

411
00:15:02,263 --> 00:15:03,701
We have six hours to find Zoe,

412
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,302
and we're fighting about credit?

413
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,636
Found. Proper size marsh
with adjacent barn.

414
00:15:08,469 --> 00:15:10,603
Let's hit it.

415
00:15:14,244 --> 00:15:15,610
I just spotted

416
00:15:15,612 --> 00:15:17,674
two sets of fresh tire
tracks heading out.

417
00:15:17,676 --> 00:15:19,672
Most likely a pickup
and minivan.

418
00:15:19,674 --> 00:15:21,007
Could've been a drop-off.

419
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:23,310
No telling how many people
are inside.

420
00:15:23,312 --> 00:15:26,077
I'll check it out.

421
00:15:32,051 --> 00:15:33,481
It's clear!

422
00:15:33,483 --> 00:15:35,481
Oh, they absolutely shot
the video in here,

423
00:15:35,483 --> 00:15:36,584
but I mean, we got nada.

424
00:15:36,586 --> 00:15:38,256
We gotta come up
with some clue to where

425
00:15:38,258 --> 00:15:39,656
they went, or we're out of here
in two minutes.

426
00:15:39,658 --> 00:15:40,856
Time's wasting.

427
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:47,699
We got nothing out here.

428
00:15:49,534 --> 00:15:52,837
You know, Sylvester has every
right to be upset with you,

429
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,877
but you seem upset with him.

430
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,941
He thinks it's because
he's seeing Megan.

431
00:15:57,944 --> 00:15:59,279
You're not happy about it?

432
00:15:59,281 --> 00:16:01,551
I'm not pleased.

433
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:06,158
<i>La Fuente de Piedra.</i>

434
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,926
The stone fountain, exciting.

435
00:16:07,928 --> 00:16:09,654
No, but it is interesting.

436
00:16:09,656 --> 00:16:12,759
According to local lore, it's
water ran red 200 years ago

437
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:15,966
when a conquistador drowned
his unfaithful wife here.

438
00:16:15,968 --> 00:16:18,070
Or old clay pipes changed
the water color.

439
00:16:18,072 --> 00:16:19,735
Either way, who cares?

440
00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:26,078
That is the most famous
landmark in the city.

441
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,407
It was very specifically

442
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:30,112
positioned over Zoe's
shoulder in that video.

443
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,513
These kidnappers were smart.

444
00:16:31,515 --> 00:16:33,952
They wanted us to see it,
but not make it too obvious.

445
00:16:33,954 --> 00:16:36,088
See, not being from here,
we had no idea what it meant.

446
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,791
But after the cartel
screwed Elia

447
00:16:37,793 --> 00:16:39,359
with the first ransom payoff,

448
00:16:39,361 --> 00:16:41,327
They must have assumed
he'd hire local mercenaries

449
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:43,527
to come after them, and they
would know about the fountain.

450
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:47,200
Why would they lure us here if
they weren't planning an ambush?

451
00:16:49,434 --> 00:16:50,799
You were saying?
Get down! Get down!

452
00:16:53,105 --> 00:16:54,535
Get down, get down,
get down, get down!

453
00:16:54,537 --> 00:16:56,040
Whoa!

454
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:58,271
Get down! Get down!

455
00:17:06,552 --> 00:17:08,151
Okay.

456
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:11,960
What we're looking at are
motion-activated machine guns,

457
00:17:11,962 --> 00:17:13,223
but we're all behind
stationary objects,

458
00:17:13,225 --> 00:17:14,223
so we're safe, right?

459
00:17:14,225 --> 00:17:16,325
Uh, well, we can't
stay here forever.

460
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,155
If we move, the gun shreds us.

461
00:17:18,157 --> 00:17:20,657
If we stay, whoever's watching
us from those cameras

462
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:22,024
will eventually come and get us.

463
00:17:22,026 --> 00:17:23,191
La Plaga set the trap.

464
00:17:23,193 --> 00:17:24,757
They saw us here,

465
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:25,861
turned on that motion sensor.

466
00:17:25,863 --> 00:17:28,092
Walter, you have a plan yet?

467
00:17:28,094 --> 00:17:29,460
Just don't move; let me think.

468
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:30,827
Okay.

469
00:17:40,874 --> 00:17:41,904
Paige! Paige!

470
00:17:41,906 --> 00:17:44,273
Oh... Oh, God!

471
00:17:44,275 --> 00:17:46,344
The fan's movement's
drawing fire.

472
00:17:46,346 --> 00:17:47,883
Happy, how long can those drums
provide protection?

473
00:17:47,885 --> 00:17:49,515
That steel's rusting thin.

474
00:17:49,517 --> 00:17:51,387
One minute, tops.

475
00:17:54,853 --> 00:17:56,955
Cabe, can you take out the gun

476
00:17:56,957 --> 00:17:58,188
that covers
our half of the barn?

477
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,693
Shoot-out with a robot gun?

478
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:01,732
It's rotating

479
00:18:01,734 --> 00:18:02,763
on a gate hinge.

480
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:05,025
Aim for the lag screw.

481
00:18:22,678 --> 00:18:24,558
She'll be riddled
with bullets in a few seconds!

482
00:18:26,715 --> 00:18:28,208
Paige, on three,
you get up and you run

483
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,775
in a straight line to me, okay?

484
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:30,743
No, I'm scared.

485
00:18:30,745 --> 00:18:32,142
You should be. One...

486
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,277
two, three.

487
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:42,388
Go, go, go!

488
00:18:43,454 --> 00:18:45,124
Ow.

489
00:18:45,126 --> 00:18:46,429
Am I all right?

490
00:18:46,431 --> 00:18:47,660
Well, you are.

491
00:18:47,662 --> 00:18:49,091
I'm not.

492
00:18:49,924 --> 00:18:51,896
<i>Okay, what we need to do now</i>

493
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:53,527
is carefully assess
our situation.

494
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:54,989
They clearly know
we're in town,

495
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:56,261
they know we're coming
after Zoe,

496
00:18:56,263 --> 00:18:58,132
so we need to find
a new plan.

497
00:18:58,134 --> 00:18:59,595
Anybody else looking
at the time?

498
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:02,031
We have two hours until the
money needs to be delivered.

499
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:03,294
It actually keeps

500
00:19:03,296 --> 00:19:04,492
pretty good time.

501
00:19:04,494 --> 00:19:06,092
Elia's contractors,

502
00:19:06,094 --> 00:19:07,963
they backed out;
they won't come into the city.

503
00:19:07,965 --> 00:19:10,529
Even armed mercenaries
are afraid of this place?

504
00:19:10,531 --> 00:19:12,401
We have to get her ourselves.

505
00:19:12,403 --> 00:19:13,863
How? We don't have
a location on her.

506
00:19:13,865 --> 00:19:15,366
The welding on
the gun's hinge,

507
00:19:15,368 --> 00:19:17,365
it's smart but rough-hewn.

508
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:18,700
I'm guessing local work.

509
00:19:18,702 --> 00:19:21,133
How many metal workers are
in this town, you think?

510
00:19:21,135 --> 00:19:24,037
Happy, no one will talk to you.

511
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,541
You want to find someone,

512
00:19:25,543 --> 00:19:27,541
hit the street,
talk to the people.

513
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:28,812
I bet you they're
on our side.

514
00:19:28,814 --> 00:19:30,412
They don't want the cartel
on their ass.

515
00:19:30,414 --> 00:19:31,843
I grew up in
neighborhoods like this.

516
00:19:31,845 --> 00:19:34,379
I can handle myself.

517
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,482
No, we stay here.

518
00:19:36,484 --> 00:19:38,080
I will crack the encryption

519
00:19:38,082 --> 00:19:39,950
on the e-mail sent to Elia.

520
00:19:39,952 --> 00:19:42,011
We will find her.

521
00:19:42,013 --> 00:19:45,151
In our timeframe,
that's nearly impossible.

522
00:19:46,113 --> 00:19:48,550
There's another e-mail
from Elia.

523
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:54,925
Get down! Get down!

524
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,220
They were filming us--
the cowering Americans.

525
00:19:57,222 --> 00:19:59,658
We unwittingly participated
in an advertisement

526
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,595
for the La Plaga cartel.

527
00:20:01,597 --> 00:20:03,500
That was the whole reason
for the setup.

528
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:06,067
Social media promotion.

529
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:08,803
Okay, I'm gonna crack the code,
but I need all of your help.

530
00:20:08,805 --> 00:20:10,938
Where's Happy? Happy?

531
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,407
<i>Hola.</i>

532
00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:20,340
<i>¿Habla ingles?</i>

533
00:20:21,477 --> 00:20:23,042
Do you know who made this?

534
00:20:23,044 --> 00:20:25,136
It's beautiful work.

535
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,413
Are you kidding me?

536
00:20:58,415 --> 00:20:59,381
Who are you?

537
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,148
A very embarrassed person.

538
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,116
What?

539
00:21:02,118 --> 00:21:04,187
I got kidnapped
by a fourth grader.

540
00:21:04,189 --> 00:21:06,217
Now who in America
is your family?

541
00:21:06,219 --> 00:21:07,586
To pay the ransom.

542
00:21:07,588 --> 00:21:08,658
Ransom?

543
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,123
Like the La Plaga cartel.

544
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,762
They kidnap rich Americans
and they make millions.

545
00:21:12,764 --> 00:21:14,394
You will get me in good
with them.

546
00:21:14,396 --> 00:21:16,824
I hate to burst
your bubble, kid,

547
00:21:16,826 --> 00:21:20,028
but my dad owns
a failing body shop.

548
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,059
Maybe he can give you
a ratchet set.

549
00:21:23,061 --> 00:21:25,235
This is not funny.

550
00:21:25,237 --> 00:21:26,963
I'll shoot you.

551
00:21:26,965 --> 00:21:29,500
Not with a gun
with no firing pin.

552
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,141
You are clearly a stupid kid,
a wannabe,

553
00:21:36,143 --> 00:21:37,909
but if you move,
it's gonna get ugly.

554
00:21:37,911 --> 00:21:39,245
I'm sorry.

555
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:40,885
I have no parents, no family.

556
00:21:40,887 --> 00:21:42,485
I just need money.

557
00:21:42,487 --> 00:21:45,251
Believe me, I've never done
anything like this before.

558
00:21:45,253 --> 00:21:46,787
Clearly.

559
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:49,888
I'm up to 16 characters

560
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,620
on the encryption code,
but then...

561
00:21:51,622 --> 00:21:55,248
I run out of time.

562
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,784
Zoe's running out of time.

563
00:21:56,786 --> 00:21:58,224
She's right.

564
00:21:58,226 --> 00:22:00,120
In an hour,
the thugs expect their money.

565
00:22:00,122 --> 00:22:01,888
I'm getting worried.
Where the hell's Happy?

566
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:04,527
Where you been?

567
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:07,263
I... got kidnapped.

568
00:22:07,265 --> 00:22:08,967
What?!
Kidnapped by who?

569
00:22:08,969 --> 00:22:11,663
This guy.

570
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:13,430
He wasn't good at it.

571
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,070
Get in here.

572
00:22:15,072 --> 00:22:16,733
Close the door.

573
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,869
Have a seat.

574
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:20,036
What were you thinking?

575
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:21,237
That I could find someone

576
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,774
who knows the cartel members.

577
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:24,215
The kid's harmless.
He was just trying to be

578
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,416
one of the big boys,
make a few bucks.

579
00:22:26,418 --> 00:22:27,552
By abducting you.

580
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,048
Does he know
the cartel or no?

581
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,824
He knows the guys who made
that gun for them.

582
00:22:30,826 --> 00:22:32,089
They're from the
same neighborhood.

583
00:22:32,091 --> 00:22:33,993
Then bringing a known felon
back-- that was dangerous.

584
00:22:33,995 --> 00:22:35,057
He's a good kid.

585
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:36,360
He's a criminal.

586
00:22:36,362 --> 00:22:38,727
There's no way that he will
lead us to whoever has Zoe.

587
00:22:38,729 --> 00:22:41,030
Actually, Walter...

588
00:22:41,032 --> 00:22:43,533
I don't agree
with that assessment.

589
00:22:43,535 --> 00:22:46,901
This groovy little gaming system
is anything but little.

590
00:22:46,903 --> 00:22:49,133
It's tricked out with
voice command capability,

591
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:50,268
high-def graphics,

592
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,940
fingerprint
vibration technology

593
00:22:52,942 --> 00:22:54,403
that'll enable you
to feel the kickback

594
00:22:54,405 --> 00:22:56,107
of any virtual
weapon you fire.

595
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:58,442
But you can't experience
major league gaming

596
00:22:58,444 --> 00:22:59,873
on a minor league
screen, so...

597
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:02,343
a high res, 85-inch TV.

598
00:23:02,345 --> 00:23:04,575
All this and more.

599
00:23:04,577 --> 00:23:07,647
This can be yours just for
playing "Give Up the Cartel."

600
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:09,983
You'll give me this?

601
00:23:09,985 --> 00:23:11,150
Mm-hmm.

602
00:23:11,152 --> 00:23:13,150
We got Uncle Sam's
checkbook, kid.

603
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,725
Just tell us where
the bad guys hang their hat.

604
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,259
I know you're torn.

605
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:20,225
You look up to those guys--
they got cash,

606
00:23:20,227 --> 00:23:21,521
and they grab headlines.

607
00:23:21,523 --> 00:23:23,328
But they do it
in a very evil way.

608
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,623
And deep down, I know you're not
anything like them.

609
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,495
I'm not sure I trust you.

610
00:23:31,538 --> 00:23:33,336
You better be right, Doc.

611
00:23:33,338 --> 00:23:35,240
Okay.

612
00:23:35,242 --> 00:23:37,502
You don't trust us.

613
00:23:37,504 --> 00:23:38,805
Here's how much we trust you.

614
00:23:38,807 --> 00:23:40,470
You sit in here
and think it over.

615
00:23:40,472 --> 00:23:41,805
We'll be next door.

616
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,844
We fresco?

617
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,148
<i>Si.</i>

618
00:24:03,023 --> 00:24:04,388
How did it go?

619
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,924
He's considering.

620
00:24:05,926 --> 00:24:07,756
I don't think this'll work.

621
00:24:07,758 --> 00:24:08,755
Shocker.

622
00:24:08,757 --> 00:24:10,827
The Genius King
doubts his underlings.

623
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:12,657
I'm not doubting<i> you, Toby.</i>

624
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,192
No. Just my plan.

625
00:24:14,194 --> 00:24:16,096
Aren't you the one who says,
"We are our ideas"?

626
00:24:16,098 --> 00:24:17,431
How about
we all stop fighting?

627
00:24:17,433 --> 00:24:18,998
How about we wait
and see what happens?

628
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,462
I know what
would've happened.

629
00:24:20,464 --> 00:24:22,427
He would've helped without
you bribing him.

630
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:24,561
You're biased because of your
own Oliver Twist upbringing.

631
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:25,928
Besides, what do you know?

632
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,233
According to the news,
you're just our supernanny.

633
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:29,833
You're playing with fire, Doc.

634
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,441
I'll be shocked
if it works.

635
00:24:31,443 --> 00:24:33,474
It astounds me
that I have to remind you all

636
00:24:33,476 --> 00:24:35,144
that I had a medical degree
from Harvard

637
00:24:35,146 --> 00:24:36,671
before most people
have their driver's licenses.

638
00:24:36,673 --> 00:24:38,039
Oh, really?
You went to Harvard?

639
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,542
You hardly ever mention it.

640
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:42,582
My point is, I am certain
that little urchin next door

641
00:24:42,584 --> 00:24:45,012
will give us
the information we want.

642
00:24:51,421 --> 00:24:53,491
He's gone.

643
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:55,859
And along with all
our I.D.s and our cash.

644
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,627
Told you it'd work.

645
00:25:01,196 --> 00:25:03,299
Little bastard's fast.
He can't wait to give our I.D.s

646
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:04,500
to his cartel buddies.

647
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:07,301
From his fake gold jewelry
to his knockoff sneakers

648
00:25:07,303 --> 00:25:09,437
that kid is dying to be
something that he's not.

649
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:10,805
And the best way to do that

650
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:12,806
is to curry favor
with the fellas

651
00:25:12,808 --> 00:25:14,111
he so desperately
longs to join.

652
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:16,215
The metallic strips
we put in our cash

653
00:25:16,217 --> 00:25:18,752
are working perfectly--
GPS signal is strong.

654
00:25:18,754 --> 00:25:20,721
I can't believe he did this.

655
00:25:20,723 --> 00:25:21,721
He's heading off the street,

656
00:25:21,723 --> 00:25:25,129
into a tenement
about two miles from here.

657
00:25:25,131 --> 00:25:26,625
If that's where the cartel is...
Hopefully, where Zoe is.

658
00:25:26,627 --> 00:25:29,064
Sylvester, can you pull up the
schematics for the building?

659
00:25:29,066 --> 00:25:30,864
You think there are county
registered blueprints

660
00:25:30,866 --> 00:25:32,032
in a Mexican slum?

661
00:25:32,034 --> 00:25:33,536
We need to study the layout
of that structure.

662
00:25:33,538 --> 00:25:35,630
Best I can do is Bing maps.

663
00:25:35,632 --> 00:25:36,901
Happy?

664
00:25:38,366 --> 00:25:41,037
Three stories,
four units per floor.

665
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,805
13,000 square feet, tops.

666
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,477
There's a tricycle
in the courtyard.

667
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:45,741
There's likely
civilians in there.

668
00:25:45,743 --> 00:25:47,245
And from what I can tell,

669
00:25:47,247 --> 00:25:48,549
only on the bottom two floors.

670
00:25:48,551 --> 00:25:50,379
Look what is wired
into the side of the building

671
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:51,348
on the third floor--

672
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,980
cables for
ambient light sensors.

673
00:25:53,982 --> 00:25:56,188
They got the whole top level
lasered off.

674
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,050
So, if they're all
in their apartment,

675
00:25:58,052 --> 00:26:00,090
they can tell if someone
steps on the floor.

676
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:01,522
We can't even
get to the stairwells.

677
00:26:01,524 --> 00:26:04,321
This configuration most likely
leads to a central hallway,

678
00:26:04,323 --> 00:26:06,193
and central hallways
have guards.

679
00:26:06,195 --> 00:26:07,929
We walk around
the wrong corner,

680
00:26:07,931 --> 00:26:09,793
we're dead, and so is Zoe.

681
00:26:16,878 --> 00:26:19,340
If we can't see around the corners,
we'll see through the walls.

682
00:26:19,342 --> 00:26:20,508
Sorry, Sylvester.

683
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,547
My souvenir.

684
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:23,313
Your souvenir...

685
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,680
contains
a light-receiving diode,

686
00:26:25,682 --> 00:26:26,848
so when it's nighttime,

687
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:29,751
it doesn't chime
and wake everyone up.

688
00:26:30,753 --> 00:26:32,647
We fire a laser pulse

689
00:26:32,649 --> 00:26:35,022
into the wall
at the end of the hall.

690
00:26:35,024 --> 00:26:37,886
The pulse scatters
in a million directions.

691
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:40,293
It bounces off
any object around the corner,

692
00:26:40,295 --> 00:26:42,789
including possibly the guard,
who won't see it

693
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:44,957
because it's invisible
to the human eye.

694
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:47,796
The photons bounce off walls,
all the way back to that diode.

695
00:26:47,798 --> 00:26:49,364
Which will be wired up
to my tablet.

696
00:26:49,366 --> 00:26:52,235
The tablet's camera will
simultaneously send the data

697
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:54,699
to Sylvester's laptop
in the car.

698
00:26:54,701 --> 00:26:56,236
I have to stay
in the car, alone?

699
00:26:56,238 --> 00:26:57,772
Would you rather be
in the building

700
00:26:57,774 --> 00:26:58,973
with the gun-toting
drug dealers?

701
00:26:58,975 --> 00:27:00,510
Enough.
Go on, Walter.

702
00:27:00,512 --> 00:27:03,309
The laptop will then read the configuration
of the photon bounceback

703
00:27:03,311 --> 00:27:05,549
and give us a rough image
of what's around the corner.

704
00:27:05,551 --> 00:27:08,181
It's easy,
so long as this diode works.

705
00:27:08,183 --> 00:27:09,917
So whether we walk
into an ambush

706
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,325
depends on the craftsmanship

707
00:27:11,327 --> 00:27:15,022
of a knock-off
motel cuckoo clock.

708
00:27:15,024 --> 00:27:16,662
Effectively, yeah.

709
00:27:16,664 --> 00:27:18,831
I will also need
some plumbing supplies.

710
00:27:31,408 --> 00:27:34,310
We're about to enter
three stories,

711
00:27:34,312 --> 00:27:36,246
about half a dozen
cartel members,

712
00:27:36,248 --> 00:27:39,655
a dozen automatic weapons and
a few thousand rounds of ammo.

713
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:40,983
Not to mention that Paco's
already given them

714
00:27:40,985 --> 00:27:42,519
our names and I.D.s.

715
00:27:42,521 --> 00:27:44,654
Probably already seen this
morning's little news piece

716
00:27:44,656 --> 00:27:46,893
and know exactly
what kind of untrained

717
00:27:46,895 --> 00:27:48,589
non-mercenaries we are.

718
00:27:49,663 --> 00:27:53,091
Well, no such thing
as bad press, right?

719
00:27:53,093 --> 00:27:55,227
Yeah, well, we don't have
a chance in hell

720
00:27:55,229 --> 00:27:56,635
unless we start working
together.

721
00:27:56,637 --> 00:27:59,171
Forget working together.
We'll have to work magic.

722
00:27:59,173 --> 00:28:00,835
Getting a girl
off the third floor

723
00:28:00,837 --> 00:28:02,508
without stepping on
the third floor?

724
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,677
That's crazy town.

725
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:04,805
I'm still concerned
about the courtyard.

726
00:28:04,807 --> 00:28:06,275
It has
a five-foot retaining wall,

727
00:28:06,277 --> 00:28:08,810
which could possibly be
trapping us in a death box.

728
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,409
Courtyard is
the only way to do this,

729
00:28:10,411 --> 00:28:12,345
so long as Happy
took care of her end.

730
00:28:12,347 --> 00:28:13,378
When have I not?

731
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,417
Happy, don't question Walter.

732
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:15,385
Didn't you see the interview?

733
00:28:15,387 --> 00:28:16,553
He's better
than us, remember?

734
00:28:16,555 --> 00:28:18,488
Damn it! What about
a young girl's life

735
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,888
isn't registering with you?

736
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,023
You all had ideas on the plan,
it came together,

737
00:28:22,025 --> 00:28:23,855
and now you need to be a team.

738
00:28:25,129 --> 00:28:27,189
We better
get our heads on right,

739
00:28:27,191 --> 00:28:30,691
or we're not coming
out of that building alive.

740
00:28:51,588 --> 00:28:52,787
Yep.

741
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:55,421
Diode's picking up
the laser bounceback.

742
00:28:55,423 --> 00:28:56,526
Sylvester, you getting this?

743
00:28:56,528 --> 00:28:57,590
Receiving data now.

744
00:28:57,592 --> 00:28:58,798
Getting an image.

745
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,797
There is a man
around the corner,

746
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:03,996
six feet tall,
sitting in a chair,

747
00:29:03,998 --> 00:29:05,867
two yards in from the corner,

748
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,068
either a dust buster
or a gun in his lap.

749
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,373
Why would he have a
dust buster, potato head?

750
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:11,375
Shut it.

751
00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:30,159
Oh, nice.
He'll be out for a while.

752
00:29:30,161 --> 00:29:31,727
I take the east stairwell here.

753
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:32,895
You take the west.

754
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:33,998
It's not a dress rehearsal.

755
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,766
Be prepared.
Copy that.

756
00:29:35,768 --> 00:29:36,965
Let's hit it.

757
00:29:46,145 --> 00:29:47,646
Be safe.

758
00:29:49,247 --> 00:29:50,677
You, too.

759
00:29:55,553 --> 00:29:56,959
You sure about Sofia?

760
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,391
It's the most popular female
Hispanic name last two years.

761
00:29:59,393 --> 00:30:00,559
Roll the dice.

762
00:30:49,953 --> 00:30:51,151
Here goes nothin'.

763
00:30:51,153 --> 00:30:52,424
Hey, scumbags!

764
00:31:09,475 --> 00:31:11,737
Okay, he's out in the hall.

765
00:31:17,011 --> 00:31:19,147
I know you're loving this.

766
00:31:46,047 --> 00:31:47,846
Happy! Hurry the hell up!

767
00:31:47,848 --> 00:31:48,814
I'm seriously outmanned!

768
00:31:48,816 --> 00:31:50,686
I'm going as fast as I can.

769
00:31:58,461 --> 00:32:00,523
It's okay-- we're gonna
get you out of here.

770
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,902
Happy? You there?

771
00:32:06,904 --> 00:32:08,165
I lost communication.

772
00:32:16,345 --> 00:32:18,510
While she just
waltzed right in?

773
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:25,022
You come into our home.

774
00:32:25,024 --> 00:32:26,822
You try to take
what's ours.

775
00:32:26,824 --> 00:32:28,694
Now you're gonna
die with pain.

776
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:41,005
You need to leave town
as fast as you can.

777
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:43,037
Now!

778
00:32:57,221 --> 00:32:58,388
We gotta hurry up!

779
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:00,356
I can't hold them off
much longer!

780
00:33:00,358 --> 00:33:01,653
Walter, how are you on time?

781
00:33:01,655 --> 00:33:03,093
Because Cabe is in big trouble.

782
00:33:03,895 --> 00:33:06,061
Happy, we're almost there.
Status?

783
00:33:06,063 --> 00:33:07,932
I'm dangling a human being
by a bed sheet.

784
00:33:07,934 --> 00:33:10,131
That is my status.

785
00:33:25,414 --> 00:33:27,748
All right, Cabe,
we got her-- bug out.

786
00:33:36,529 --> 00:33:39,061
Coming in three, two...!

787
00:33:39,063 --> 00:33:41,195
One!

788
00:33:50,004 --> 00:33:51,799
Everyone okay?

789
00:33:51,801 --> 00:33:53,367
All right,
we gotta hurry.

790
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:54,735
Sylvester ever
get set up?

791
00:33:54,737 --> 00:33:57,440
Just did it--
I'm on my way to the car!

792
00:33:57,442 --> 00:33:59,041
Okay.

793
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:10,896
You messed with the wrong
group of people, my friends.

794
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:25,253
Before you do anything rash,

795
00:34:25,255 --> 00:34:26,787
you should know...

796
00:34:27,834 --> 00:34:29,558
You recognize that gun?

797
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,997
The motion sensor is calibrated
to not shoot anything

798
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,500
before the door,
but it will take out anything

799
00:34:35,502 --> 00:34:38,401
that moves on the other
side of it.

800
00:34:38,401 --> 00:34:41,041
And fortunately,
that's the side you're on.

801
00:34:41,043 --> 00:34:42,912
I improved your gun.

802
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,744
You so much as move
a trigger finger, you're dead.

803
00:34:44,746 --> 00:34:46,311
Lying<i> puta.</i>

804
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:51,621
I can see you're all scared--
that's good.

805
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:53,660
It means you won't
do anything stupid.

806
00:34:53,662 --> 00:34:55,428
Like move again.

807
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:57,227
So here's
how this is gonna go down.

808
00:34:57,229 --> 00:35:00,332
My friends and I are gonna walk
Zoe right out that door.

809
00:35:00,334 --> 00:35:03,964
And none of you are gonna do
a damn thing about it.

810
00:35:03,966 --> 00:35:05,970
You try to intervene,

811
00:35:05,972 --> 00:35:09,234
it'll be the last thing
you ever do.

812
00:35:09,236 --> 00:35:11,306
Come on.
They can't hurt you.

813
00:35:12,508 --> 00:35:16,072
I've put a 24-hour battery
on the motion sensor,

814
00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:17,775
so, for your sake,

815
00:35:17,777 --> 00:35:19,878
I hope that you
and your men

816
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,182
are disciplined.

817
00:35:22,184 --> 00:35:24,181
Now remember...

818
00:35:24,183 --> 00:35:26,084
your nose does not itch.

819
00:35:26,086 --> 00:35:27,181
Toby.

820
00:35:27,183 --> 00:35:28,349
Coming.

821
00:35:33,859 --> 00:35:35,633
That was really cool.

822
00:35:35,635 --> 00:35:38,664
We should get a clear
signal in a few miles.

823
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:40,936
We'll call
your dad, okay?

824
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:43,336
Thank you.

825
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,342
Stop the car.

826
00:35:49,344 --> 00:35:50,477
What? Why?

827
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:52,844
Just stop the car up there.

828
00:35:59,748 --> 00:36:01,714
Give me your watch.

829
00:36:01,716 --> 00:36:04,114
This is a $5,000 watch.

830
00:36:04,116 --> 00:36:06,723
From the U.S. ambassador
to Paraguay.

831
00:36:06,725 --> 00:36:09,292
The kid saved my life.

832
00:36:18,101 --> 00:36:21,400
Sell the watch, buy a train
ticket, and move far away.

833
00:36:22,804 --> 00:36:25,043
<i>Gracias.</i>

834
00:36:36,352 --> 00:36:38,414
Okay-- vitals are good,
but you're still dehydrated.

835
00:36:38,416 --> 00:36:40,886
So drink up over
the next few days, okay?

836
00:36:42,657 --> 00:36:44,823
Dad...

837
00:36:48,361 --> 00:36:50,328
I'm sorry.

838
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,527
I'm so sorry
about everything.

839
00:36:57,937 --> 00:37:01,573
Um... we should, uh,
give them a minute.

840
00:37:01,575 --> 00:37:04,238

842

along the same lines of,
uh, reconciliation,

843
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:18,282
I wanted to, uh, apologize
for the whole...

844
00:37:18,284 --> 00:37:20,186
interview thing.

845
00:37:20,188 --> 00:37:23,227
I, uh, should
have made sure

846
00:37:23,229 --> 00:37:25,092
that you were
all included.

847
00:37:25,094 --> 00:37:26,996
Everyone.

848
00:37:26,998 --> 00:37:30,131
Uh... I just
wasn't thinking.

849
00:37:31,932 --> 00:37:35,067
Distance between family
is never good.

850
00:37:35,069 --> 00:37:38,140
I don't like fighting
with you guys.

851
00:37:38,142 --> 00:37:42,150
Yeah, I'm sorry
I was such a pip.

852
00:37:42,152 --> 00:37:43,718
Ditto.

853
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,855
If we don't look out
for each other, who will?

854
00:37:45,857 --> 00:37:47,753
Right?

855
00:37:47,755 --> 00:37:50,026
I wasn't really fighting
with anybody, so I'm not sorry.

856
00:37:50,028 --> 00:37:53,427
But I'm glad
everyone's made up.

857
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,165
Uh...

858
00:37:57,167 --> 00:37:59,502
That was evolved of you.

859
00:37:59,504 --> 00:38:01,838
So while you're in the spirit,
go talk to Sylvester.

860
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,573
Please--
he's dying inside.

861
00:38:06,111 --> 00:38:07,749
Hey.

862
00:38:12,548 --> 00:38:14,449
Why aren't I good
enough for your sister?

863
00:38:14,451 --> 00:38:16,648
I know the obvious--

864
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:19,655
my stress, my anxiety, but...

865
00:38:19,657 --> 00:38:21,223
I'm a good person.

866
00:38:21,225 --> 00:38:23,789
Good should count
for something.

867
00:38:24,855 --> 00:38:26,822
It hurts me.

868
00:38:26,824 --> 00:38:30,492
Sylvester, you are, uh,
kind and generous

869
00:38:30,494 --> 00:38:34,363
and a better human being
than I will ever be.

870
00:38:35,837 --> 00:38:39,498
But I have spent a long time
preparing myself

871
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,234
for the fact that Megan
will very likely die.

872
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:45,808
My research isn't going
as fast as I had hoped for.

873
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:48,439
And I don't know
if I can save her.

874
00:38:48,441 --> 00:38:50,801
Now, I can handle
the fallout.

875
00:38:50,803 --> 00:38:54,040
But you are not designed

876
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:56,839
to process the pain

877
00:38:56,841 --> 00:38:58,773
that you're gonna feel.

878
00:38:58,775 --> 00:39:01,811
Getting close to her
is-is dangerous.

879
00:39:01,813 --> 00:39:03,379
For you.

880
00:39:03,381 --> 00:39:05,551
But she calms me, Walter.

881
00:39:07,953 --> 00:39:10,222
She makes me feel
good about myself.

882
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:17,089
And I know there's risk.

883
00:39:17,091 --> 00:39:19,991
But if there's one thing that's
worth the risk, it's her.

884
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:25,234
I'm glad she's found
such a good guy.

What are you doing?
