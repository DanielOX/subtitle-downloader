18
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:53,586
I want Gallo out.

19
00:00:53,588 --> 00:00:54,887
Then I'll resign.

20
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:56,389
Effective immediately.

21
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:02,995
I just don't want him
to become you.

22
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,869
I don't think
I can be here anymore.

Calling to order Scorpion 2.0.

00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,280
Toby Curtis?

25
00:01:29,282 --> 00:01:31,449
Check.

26
00:01:31,451 --> 00:01:33,317
Sylvester Dodd?

27
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:35,486
Check.

28
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,756
And... Happy Quinn?

29
00:01:38,758 --> 00:01:40,058
Whatever you're doing,

30
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,359
stop it immediately.

31
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:43,461
I'm maintaining a sense
of order in our chaos,

32
00:01:43,463 --> 00:01:44,662
filling a leadership vacuum.

33
00:01:44,664 --> 00:01:46,597
You're highly unqualified.

34
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,533
Spend your time wisely.

35
00:01:48,535 --> 00:01:50,668
Look for a new gig,
like me.

36
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,272
Now, Walter did not say that
this was the end of Scorpion.

37
00:01:54,274 --> 00:01:56,841
He only said that
he didn't need Cabe or Paige.

38
00:01:56,843 --> 00:01:58,342
However implausible that is,

39
00:01:58,344 --> 00:02:00,678
maybe Scorpion will...

40
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,747
- persevere.
- Run the numbers on that.

41
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:05,750
We lost a third of our personnel
in one night.

42
00:02:05,752 --> 00:02:07,552
We're back to where
we were a year ago.

43
00:02:07,554 --> 00:02:09,987
Broke, aimless, losers.

44
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:11,723
I was not
"aimless""

45
00:02:11,725 --> 00:02:13,057
I'm calling Walter again.

46
00:02:13,059 --> 00:02:14,225
You've called him ten times.

47
00:02:14,227 --> 00:02:15,293
He's not
going to answer.

48
00:02:15,295 --> 00:02:16,295
Paige, then.

49
00:02:16,296 --> 00:02:18,296
She bailed on us.

50
00:02:18,298 --> 00:02:19,564
Who needs her?

51
00:02:19,566 --> 00:02:21,299
Then I'm calling Cabe.

52
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:23,000
Walter threw Cabe off the team.

53
00:02:23,002 --> 00:02:25,503
No Cabe, no Paige--

54
00:02:25,505 --> 00:02:27,071
the Scorpion you're thinking of

55
00:02:27,073 --> 00:02:28,473
does not
exist anymore.

56
00:02:28,475 --> 00:02:30,608
Accept it and pull the rip cord.

57
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,144
We're not going down
without a fight.

58
00:02:33,146 --> 00:02:34,412
Isn't this worth it?

59
00:02:34,414 --> 00:02:37,248
Call Cabe.
What do I care?

60
00:02:45,491 --> 00:02:47,925
So, I got your
new assignment.

61
00:02:49,762 --> 00:02:51,929
Pomona airport?
You're on a desk,

62
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:54,132
but you're in charge
of all TSA.

63
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:56,868
If you get bored, you could
strap on a blue uniform

64
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,603
and work the
luggage scanner.

65
00:02:58,605 --> 00:03:00,872
Why do I get the sense
you're enjoying this?

66
00:03:00,874 --> 00:03:03,941
Scorpion's flameout freed up
funding for certain pet projects,

67
00:03:03,943 --> 00:03:05,943
but this is all
you're doing, Gallo.

68
00:03:05,945 --> 00:03:07,912
You were always
intimidated by them

69
00:03:07,914 --> 00:03:10,014
because they're smarter
than you by a millionfold,

70
00:03:10,016 --> 00:03:12,784
save countless lives, and help countless
more than you ever could.

71
00:03:12,786 --> 00:03:14,452
Maybe Pomona's too good for you.

72
00:03:15,687 --> 00:03:17,889
I'll never know.

73
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,893
You can take this
assignment and shove it.

74
00:03:23,929 --> 00:03:25,763
How the hell am I supposed
to fix this team

75
00:03:25,765 --> 00:03:27,598
if no one's gonna pick up?
That was Megan.

76
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,734
Walter missed her weekly
doctor's assessment.

77
00:03:29,736 --> 00:03:31,769
He didn't even call.
She can't get ahold of him.

78
00:03:31,771 --> 00:03:32,970
That's not great.

79
00:03:32,972 --> 00:03:35,206
He's never missed
an appointment before.

80
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,675
Megan thinks something could
be very wrong, and so do I.

81
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:39,243
Or he's holed up
in a bar somewhere

82
00:03:39,245 --> 00:03:41,012
throwing back tequila bombs rewriting
the relativity theorem.

83
00:03:41,014 --> 00:03:42,413
Walter doesn't drink.
Then he's throwing back

84
00:03:42,415 --> 00:03:44,081
milkshakes rewriting
the relativity theorem.

85
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,617
Can I please have
a little emotional escapism

86
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:48,186
while we trace his phone?

87
00:03:48,188 --> 00:03:50,354
On it.

88
00:03:56,796 --> 00:03:58,329
Hi. This is Paige Dineen.

89
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:00,731
I can't come to the phone,
but leave a detailed...

90
00:04:07,105 --> 00:04:08,606
Are you calling Walter again?

91
00:04:08,608 --> 00:04:11,175
Hi, Walter.
It's me again.

92
00:04:11,177 --> 00:04:12,810
Can you call me back, please?

93
00:04:12,812 --> 00:04:14,912
I promise my call
will be efficient.

94
00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:17,615
I just want to
say good-bye.

95
00:04:25,657 --> 00:04:28,092
Why won't he pick up?
Ralph,

96
00:04:28,094 --> 00:04:29,393
you've already left
three messages.

97
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:30,828
Now pack.
We're leaving soon.

98
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,196
I don't want to go.

99
00:04:32,198 --> 00:04:34,198
It's two days.
And then it'll be forever.

100
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,167
Go.

101
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,406
This is Walter O'Brien.

102
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:43,875
Please leave a brief message.

103
00:04:43,877 --> 00:04:45,910
Yeah, it's me this time.
I can't believe...

104
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:47,411
you're not returning
Ralph's calls.

105
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:50,448
I always knew you had issues,
Walter, but this is...

106
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,116
way beneath you.

107
00:04:52,118 --> 00:04:55,586
You are selfish,
and you are being a jerk.

108
00:05:01,393 --> 00:05:03,728
Glad you finally grew a pair.

109
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,296
Uh, it's Happy Quinn.

110
00:05:05,298 --> 00:05:07,531
From the team
you were formerly a part of.

111
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:10,067
Oh. Happy, I'm-I'm-I'm sorry,
I thought it was...

112
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:11,535
I'm looking for Walter.

113
00:05:11,537 --> 00:05:13,337
No.
You know where he is?

114
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:14,939
Ralph has been trying
to call him all morning.

115
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:16,073
Okay. Bye.

116
00:05:16,075 --> 00:05:17,575
Happy. Come on.

117
00:05:17,577 --> 00:05:18,843
Okay, I'm
ready to go.

118
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:21,612
No, no. That will not fit
in the bag-- it's not going.

119
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:23,347
Going where?

120
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:24,882
A little trip.

121
00:05:24,884 --> 00:05:25,950
You're moving this quick?

122
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:27,318
No flies on you, girl.

123
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,620
Drew invited us to Portland
for the weekend

124
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:32,156
just to get a feel
for the place, but we wouldn't

125
00:05:32,158 --> 00:05:33,462
move there till the end
of the school year.

126
00:05:33,486 --> 00:05:34,027
Great.

127
00:05:34,028 --> 00:05:35,727
Bring a raincoat
and a mosquito net.

128
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:37,295
Okay, you're obviously

129
00:05:37,297 --> 00:05:38,329
upset with me.

130
00:05:38,331 --> 00:05:39,430
You come onto our team,

131
00:05:39,432 --> 00:05:41,132
mess up with Walt's head,
and get us used

132
00:05:41,134 --> 00:05:43,267
to having that kid around,
and then you up and leave.

133
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:44,735
We were all good
before you came along.

134
00:05:44,737 --> 00:05:46,704
I am doing it
for the sake of my son.

135
00:05:46,706 --> 00:05:47,872
And for the record,

136
00:05:47,874 --> 00:05:49,941
before I came along,
you guys were a disaster.

137
00:05:49,943 --> 00:05:51,709
You've wormed your way
into Walt's head,

138
00:05:51,711 --> 00:05:54,078
and that is a big reason
why he's MIA right now.

139
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,513
I don't need to listen to this.

140
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:57,848
Then don't!

141
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,729
His phone is cloaked,
and his GPS is disabled.

142
00:06:11,731 --> 00:06:13,197
Walter, you clever bastard.

143
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,166
You're killing us here.

144
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:16,801
You'll never find him that way.

145
00:06:16,803 --> 00:06:18,536
Well, what do you care?

146
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:20,204
You're already looking
for a new job.

147
00:06:20,206 --> 00:06:22,373
We can track
the car's onboard computer.

148
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,842
All we need is the VIN.
Elia...

149
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:26,377
would have that.

150
00:06:27,546 --> 00:06:29,780
Well, look who wants
to help now.

151
00:06:29,782 --> 00:06:31,949
Would you just admit
that you're on board

152
00:06:31,951 --> 00:06:33,551
with trying to save Scorpion,
the greatest thing

153
00:06:33,553 --> 00:06:34,885
that ever happened to any of us.

154
00:06:34,887 --> 00:06:38,289
Guys... Elia's
Playa Vista headquarters.

155
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,758
Mm.

156
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,594
Ma'am, I know there's a policy.

157
00:06:43,596 --> 00:06:45,329
Outside of family,

158
00:06:45,331 --> 00:06:47,531
Mr. Elia cannot be interrupted
during a meeting.

159
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:51,268
But by saving his daughter,
we became de facto family.

160
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,603
The notion is outlined
in a Chinese proverb

161
00:06:52,605 --> 00:06:53,871
I doubt you're familiar with.

162
00:06:53,873 --> 00:06:56,340
What I am familiar with
is the number for security.

163
00:06:56,342 --> 00:06:57,408
Okay.

164
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,776
We'll be sitting down now.

165
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,815
You think Walter isn't calling us back
because he's preparing his exit strategy

166
00:07:04,817 --> 00:07:06,484
to come work here?
I mean...

167
00:07:06,486 --> 00:07:08,119
look at this place--
we can't compete.

168
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:09,887
It's not so great.
It is.

169
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:11,589
Multiple dedicated T-1 lines,

170
00:07:11,591 --> 00:07:13,090
state-of-the-art engineering,

171
00:07:13,092 --> 00:07:14,981
unlimited resources.

172
00:07:15,005 --> 00:07:16,528
You know what this place
doesn't have? Us.

173
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:18,062
Tobes and
the Sly dog.

174
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:19,563
And that's
what's gonna keep Walter

175
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:20,831
at Scorpion where he belongs.

176
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,885
That guy is going down the hall
on a hoverboard!

177
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,643
Hey.
Don't look. Don't be seduced.

178
00:07:26,605 --> 00:07:29,740
Happy should be
in position by now.

179
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:38,916
What the hell?

180
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:40,484
I need that VIN number

181
00:07:40,486 --> 00:07:42,787
of the bribe on wheels
you gave Walter O'Brien.

182
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:45,623
I'm in the middle
of a meeting.

183
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,024
And I'm in the middle
of your conference table.

184
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:48,659
You stuck your nose

185
00:07:48,661 --> 00:07:51,328
where it didn't belong,
looking to break apart

186
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,165
the only family
some of us have ever known.

187
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:56,300
I was being friendly.

188
00:07:56,302 --> 00:07:58,069
You were poaching our boss.

189
00:07:58,071 --> 00:08:00,037
Now he's missing,
and I'm not leaving

190
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:02,206
without that VIN.

191
00:08:19,057 --> 00:08:22,393
Onboard computer's pinging
right here.

192
00:08:22,395 --> 00:08:24,428
Do you see a car?
I see no car.

193
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,663
Did Elia
mislead us?

194
00:08:25,665 --> 00:08:27,398
Maybe he doesn't
want us to find him.

195
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,200
- Rat.
- I'll call Walter again.

196
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:34,705
It's ringing.

197
00:08:34,707 --> 00:08:37,108
You hear that?

198
00:08:42,514 --> 00:08:44,648
Hey, guys...

199
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:06,770
Aw, geez.

200
00:09:06,772 --> 00:09:08,839
Okay, count of three,

201
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:09,907
we yell his name.

202
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:11,509
On three,
or two, three, then go?

203
00:09:11,511 --> 00:09:12,576
Which is
essentially four.

204
00:09:12,578 --> 00:09:13,611
On three.

205
00:09:13,613 --> 00:09:14,945
Okay, one, two...

206
00:09:14,947 --> 00:09:16,046
Walter!

207
00:09:18,017 --> 00:09:19,450
Walter!

208
00:09:22,488 --> 00:09:24,355
Walter!

209
00:09:29,327 --> 00:09:30,461
Hello?

210
00:09:30,463 --> 00:09:32,029
Oh! Walter?

211
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:34,465
You're balanced
on a cliff's edge.

212
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:35,866
One wrong move,

213
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:37,735
and the car falls 300 feet.

214
00:09:37,737 --> 00:09:40,137
Stay very, very still.

215

217

Police and rescue are on their
way. How you holding up, Walter?

218
00:09:54,684 --> 00:09:55,783
He doesn't sound good.

219
00:09:55,785 --> 00:09:57,718
Tell the doctor where it hurts.

220
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,853
My left side.

221
00:09:59,855 --> 00:10:02,189
What's it look like?
Is it bruised or bleeding?

222
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:04,024
I can't move to see.

223
00:10:04,026 --> 00:10:05,726
I'm pinned to the seat.

224
00:10:05,728 --> 00:10:07,494
Pinned how?
Something leaning on you, or...?

225
00:10:07,496 --> 00:10:09,463
Or what?

226
00:10:09,465 --> 00:10:10,465
Stay cool, Walt.

227
00:10:10,466 --> 00:10:11,598
We'll have a visual

228
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,233
on you in 30 seconds.

229
00:10:14,436 --> 00:10:16,136
Birdroni lives.

230
00:10:16,138 --> 00:10:18,272
It was gonna be your birthday
present, but I wasn't

231
00:10:18,274 --> 00:10:20,441
done yet. I was gonna
mount a camera...

232
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:22,276
We'll need one,
but I have a solution.

233
00:10:23,545 --> 00:10:24,945
Any duct tape in your truck?

234
00:10:31,487 --> 00:10:34,888
You really did a number
on that car, O'Brien.

235
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,790
Yeah, well, I was doing fine

236
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:39,493
until an untimely interface
with Mother Nature.

237
00:10:42,732 --> 00:10:44,164
This's what I was afraid of.

238
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,867
So, it's, um, good news?

239
00:10:46,869 --> 00:10:49,069
Walter, you're impaled
on what looks like

240
00:10:49,071 --> 00:10:51,038
a piece of metal
from the guardrail.

241
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,206
So, it's excellent news then.

242
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,674
From the color of the blood

243
00:10:53,676 --> 00:10:55,008
and the position of the metal,

244
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,844
your body has been able
to clot off.

245
00:10:56,846 --> 00:10:58,312
Best scenario,
we keep it that way

246
00:10:58,314 --> 00:11:00,047
until we can get you
to a hospital,

247
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:01,849
but that means
no movement, nada.

248
00:11:01,851 --> 00:11:04,385
The wound is dangerous
close to his spleen.

249
00:11:04,387 --> 00:11:05,886
I thought
we don't need the spleen.

250
00:11:05,888 --> 00:11:07,755
We don't, but it's basically
a giant sack of blood.

251
00:11:07,757 --> 00:11:10,557
Never good to lose a giant sack
of blood.

252
00:11:12,294 --> 00:11:13,994
Walter, I know
it hurts like hell.

253
00:11:13,996 --> 00:11:15,562
You got to stay with me here.

254
00:11:15,564 --> 00:11:18,232
No, I was just...
I'm just running some numbers.

255
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:21,268
Okay, so, I-I'm perched on...

256
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,937
...about a 71% grade?

257
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:26,340
Give or take.
I don't have my protractor.

258
00:11:26,342 --> 00:11:28,675
I do-- 71.8.

259
00:11:28,677 --> 00:11:30,043
All right, okay,

260
00:11:30,045 --> 00:11:32,279
so, given my precarious hold
on the Cliffside,

261
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:34,381
the extent of my injuries,

262
00:11:34,383 --> 00:11:37,518
the time needed
for successful rescue...

263
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,756
Sylvester, would you put this
at about a 97% chance of death?

264
00:11:42,758 --> 00:11:45,159
You know, Walter, I've never
put much faith in numbers.

265
00:11:45,161 --> 00:11:47,361
That's the police.
I'll coordinate.

266
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:49,430
They need to know
who they're dealing with here.

267
00:11:49,432 --> 00:11:51,298
You don't handle
authority well!

268
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,033
This is Paige's job.

269
00:11:53,035 --> 00:11:54,501
Yeah, we don't need her.

270
00:11:54,503 --> 00:11:55,903
Paige. Where's Paige?

271
00:11:55,905 --> 00:11:57,838
Taking a little R&R.

272
00:11:59,074 --> 00:12:01,708
She's taking Ralph
to Portland to see Drew.

273
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,011
I told her
it was a stupid idea.

274
00:12:04,013 --> 00:12:06,146
What the hell is this?! I said

275
00:12:06,148 --> 00:12:08,182
fire department and
ambulance. Do you have

276
00:12:08,184 --> 00:12:09,783
any idea who's
stuck down there?

277
00:12:09,785 --> 00:12:11,819
All right, buddy, we're gonna
need you to take a step back.

278
00:12:11,821 --> 00:12:13,020
Whoa. I'm not your buddy,

279
00:12:13,022 --> 00:12:14,488
and if anybody's gonna
be condescended to,

280
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,756
it'll be you by me.

281
00:12:15,758 --> 00:12:18,292
One of the great minds of
this or any other lifetime--

282
00:12:18,294 --> 00:12:21,061
and also my friend--
is clinging to life by a thread.

283
00:12:21,063 --> 00:12:23,497
We are formulating
a plan of rescue,

284
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:26,400
and are gonna need
every resource at our disposal.

285
00:12:26,402 --> 00:12:28,635
The resources belong to trained
rescue personnel that...

286
00:12:28,637 --> 00:12:31,138
That don't have the brain
power of me with a hangover

287
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,606
and this guy when
he's sleeping.

288
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:33,941
So, first thing
we'll need,

289
00:12:33,943 --> 00:12:36,610
Officer, is a soil integrity
report on that Cliffside

290
00:12:36,612 --> 00:12:38,679
so we can start working
toward a solution.

291
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:41,381
Excuse me. Do you know
what this badge means?

292
00:12:41,383 --> 00:12:43,884
That you got "D"s
in high school?

293
00:12:43,886 --> 00:12:48,021
Actually,
I have a better solution.

294
00:12:48,023 --> 00:12:50,324
Don't get in the car.
Sly!

295
00:12:50,326 --> 00:12:51,326
Call Cabe!

296
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,893
Quiet down. Come on.

297
00:12:52,895 --> 00:12:54,962
Track him down!

298
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,335
I'll admit, Paige would
have handled this better.

299
00:13:17,118 --> 00:13:19,119
Cabe.

300
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:23,857
Cabe, they're talking
about sending a team down

301
00:13:23,859 --> 00:13:25,359
with grappling hooks.

302
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:27,561
Happy says this is going to
disrupt the soil beneath the car

303
00:13:27,563 --> 00:13:29,263
and drop it like a hot potato.

304
00:13:29,265 --> 00:13:30,597
They've shoved us aside.

305
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:32,065
They won't listen to us.

306
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:33,467
They're gonna kill him.

307
00:13:33,469 --> 00:13:36,236
All right.

308
00:13:36,238 --> 00:13:38,872
Who the hell's in charge
of this operation?!

309
00:13:38,874 --> 00:13:39,973
I am.

310
00:13:39,975 --> 00:13:42,643
Wrong! I am. Cabe
Gallo, Homeland.

311
00:13:42,645 --> 00:13:45,712
Now, get my behaviorist and
engineer out of that squad car

312
00:13:45,714 --> 00:13:47,281
and give my team some room.

313
00:13:47,283 --> 00:13:49,783
That man down there
is a government asset.

314
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:51,184
Move!

315
00:13:51,186 --> 00:13:54,254
You heard the man. Move it!

316
00:13:55,423 --> 00:13:57,424
Did you just flash
your scuba certification?

317
00:13:57,426 --> 00:14:00,761
Yeah. I don't work
for Homeland anymore.

318
00:14:09,404 --> 00:14:12,506
Oh, my God.

319
00:14:12,508 --> 00:14:14,207
Cabe?

320
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:16,843
Yes. We thought it
would be best to bring him in.

321
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:19,846
Yeah, I'm here,

322
00:14:19,848 --> 00:14:22,950
and you don't like it,
you can yell at me later.

323
00:14:22,952 --> 00:14:26,353
Consider it a date.

324
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,792
Our soil expert just confirmed
what Ms. Quinn was saying.

325
00:14:31,794 --> 00:14:33,193
Thank you very much.

326
00:14:33,195 --> 00:14:34,328
Which kills us sending guys down

327
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,029
to hook the chassis
and winch the car.

328
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,764
A chopper extraction
might be faster.

329
00:14:37,766 --> 00:14:40,200
No, the rotor wash could upset
the car's balance.

330
00:14:40,202 --> 00:14:41,635
Call that a no go.

331
00:14:41,637 --> 00:14:44,304
So, we're gonna send a team up
from the canyon floor.

332
00:14:44,306 --> 00:14:45,572
They'll approach
from underneath,

333
00:14:45,574 --> 00:14:46,773
secure the vehicle from there

334
00:14:46,775 --> 00:14:48,108
without going near
the support topsoil.

335
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,710
But nothing's guaranteed,
and we're talking

336
00:14:49,712 --> 00:14:51,912
a half hour climb at least.

337
00:14:54,383 --> 00:14:56,917
If I hold out that long.

338
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:58,352
I don't like that look.

339
00:14:58,354 --> 00:15:00,187
Do I need to throw down a copy

340
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:01,722
of <i>The Power</i>
<i>of Positive Thinking?</i>

341
00:15:01,724 --> 00:15:03,423
I want to see the equipment
your team will be using,

342
00:15:03,425 --> 00:15:04,891
see if I can cut down
the amount of time

343
00:15:04,893 --> 00:15:06,126
it'll take them
to get to Walter.

344
00:15:06,128 --> 00:15:08,095
Okay, Walt. Happy's on it.

345
00:15:08,097 --> 00:15:10,163
We're gonna have a rescue team
up to you very soon.

346
00:15:10,165 --> 00:15:12,633
Yeah, really?
Because from what I heard,

347
00:15:12,635 --> 00:15:15,202
it won't be that soon...
or at all.

348
00:15:15,204 --> 00:15:19,873
Guys, do you think, uh,
you could reach out to...

349
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:24,745
to Paige for me, um,
get her and Ralph over here?

350
00:15:24,747 --> 00:15:26,480
I've actually already
reached out to them.

351
00:15:26,482 --> 00:15:27,681
Her phone is powered off.

352
00:15:27,683 --> 00:15:29,650
The last tower ping
was near her apartment.

353
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:31,551
Look, there's gonna be plenty
of time to talk to her

354
00:15:31,553 --> 00:15:33,320
once we get you back
up here with us.

355
00:15:33,322 --> 00:15:35,188
I'd really like to talk to her
as soon as possible.

356
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,425
I'm getting a black and white
sent to her home right now.

357
00:15:38,427 --> 00:15:39,660
Thank you.

358
00:15:39,662 --> 00:15:42,095
Go find this woman.

359
00:15:43,631 --> 00:15:45,832
Cabe, uh...

360
00:15:47,669 --> 00:15:49,569
Cabe, when I was 16 years old...

361
00:15:49,571 --> 00:15:51,304
What I did with
Baghdad was wrong.

362
00:15:51,306 --> 00:15:53,473
You have every right
to be mad at me.

363
00:15:53,475 --> 00:15:54,675
No, I was

364
00:15:54,677 --> 00:15:57,811
hurt and, uh... I overreacted.

365
00:15:57,813 --> 00:16:00,213
I was, uh... emotional,

366
00:16:00,215 --> 00:16:02,616
and, uh, ineffective, and

367
00:16:02,618 --> 00:16:05,485
if I'd been logical,
then I'd, uh...

368
00:16:05,487 --> 00:16:07,254
I'd have realized the man

369
00:16:07,256 --> 00:16:10,590
who knew me when I was younger
would never hurt me on purpose.

370
00:16:13,695 --> 00:16:16,396
Thank you, Walter.

371
00:16:16,398 --> 00:16:19,299
Cabe, you told me that
when your daughter passed away,

372
00:16:19,301 --> 00:16:22,169
you'd visit her grave
every Sunday?

373
00:16:22,171 --> 00:16:24,171
Yes.

374
00:16:24,173 --> 00:16:26,239
Without fail.

375
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:31,044
The grass at her plot-- it was
always, uh, green, healthy?

376
00:16:31,046 --> 00:16:33,013
And the others were brown?

377
00:16:33,015 --> 00:16:34,514
I hacked the sprinkler system.

378
00:16:34,516 --> 00:16:36,383
I, uh, watered it

379
00:16:36,385 --> 00:16:38,552
twice a day.
The others were...

380
00:16:38,554 --> 00:16:41,054
once, uh, a week.

381
00:16:41,056 --> 00:16:44,858
I always thought that
was the groundskeeper

382
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,928
taking pity on me,
'cause I was there alone.

383
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,564
No, it was me.

384
00:16:53,534 --> 00:16:56,837
15 years ago, you were so
mad at me about Baghdad.

385
00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:59,139
Why would you do that for me?

386
00:16:59,141 --> 00:17:01,108
That's not the point.

387
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,009
The point is
that I don't want there

388
00:17:03,011 --> 00:17:05,312
to be any more secrets
between us.

389
00:17:10,785 --> 00:17:11,985
Guys, we got a problem!

390
00:17:11,987 --> 00:17:14,087
The engine.

391
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:15,689
Oh, yeah, yeah.

392
00:17:15,691 --> 00:17:17,591
Yup, this is a problem.

393
00:17:20,129 --> 00:17:21,862
Spin the drone around!

394
00:17:21,864 --> 00:17:23,163
Smoke!

395
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:25,632
Uh, it's from the oil pan.

396
00:17:25,634 --> 00:17:26,867
It must have been

397
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,935
an electrical short
caused by the accident.

398
00:17:28,937 --> 00:17:31,438
If the flame gets to the gas
tank, the whole car goes up.

399
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,540
Water cannon will blow the car
right off that perch.

400
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:34,708
A fire retardant

401
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,909
might be better.

402
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:37,310
No, you-you... you can't.

403
00:17:37,312 --> 00:17:39,379
You can't control the
weight distribution even with

404
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:40,714
foam or gel.

405
00:17:40,716 --> 00:17:42,682
Well, if we can't douse it,
maybe we can prevent it

406
00:17:42,684 --> 00:17:43,884
from spreading
to the gas tank.

407
00:17:43,886 --> 00:17:45,152
How?
I have no idea.

408
00:17:45,154 --> 00:17:46,386
It was just a conceptual notion.

409
00:17:46,388 --> 00:17:48,989
Fire can't burn without fuel.

410
00:17:48,991 --> 00:17:51,191
Guys, we need to drain the oil.

411
00:17:51,193 --> 00:17:53,927
We can't go down there
and put you up on blocks.

412
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:55,028
You don't need blocks.

413
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,596
You have an ambulance
and a fire truck.

414
00:17:58,099 --> 00:18:00,400
<i>Ralph, come on.</i>
<i>Clock's ticking.</i>

415
00:18:05,006 --> 00:18:07,274
What's going on?

416
00:18:07,276 --> 00:18:09,576
I'm not pleased
with this plan.

417
00:18:09,578 --> 00:18:11,778
Think of all the firsts.

418
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,080
Ride in a plane,
see the Atlantic Ocean.

419
00:18:14,082 --> 00:18:16,917
There's something
wrong with Walter.

420
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,319
Why didn't he pick up?

421
00:18:21,022 --> 00:18:23,423
Walter is...

422
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:25,358
going through a lot right now,

423
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,394
and it's best
we leave him alone.

424
00:18:27,396 --> 00:18:30,130
Just follow our own path,
just for today.

425
00:18:31,032 --> 00:18:32,499
Okay?

426
00:18:37,772 --> 00:18:39,973
Okay.

427
00:18:56,091 --> 00:18:59,192
Guys, not to pressure anyone,
but a, uh, a status update

428
00:18:59,194 --> 00:19:02,863
on my, uh, proposed solution
would certainly be comforting.

429
00:19:02,865 --> 00:19:04,731
We're working on it.
Okay, aim it at the car.

430
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:06,233
I thought we said
that that would

431
00:19:06,235 --> 00:19:07,434
knock the car off the hill.

432
00:19:07,436 --> 00:19:09,169
Okay, just do it, and
then, get me the jacket and

433
00:19:09,171 --> 00:19:11,271
the duct tape I need. Now!

434
00:19:11,273 --> 00:19:12,439
I'm calculating
we have seconds at best

435
00:19:12,441 --> 00:19:14,207
before this entire car
is engulfed.

436
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:15,542
I got the dart!

437
00:19:15,544 --> 00:19:18,678
Ten steel syringe needles--
best I could do.

438
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:29,623
- Sylvester!
- Okay. You have a target

439
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:32,158
surface area of eight square
inches. You need to hit the pan

440
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,261
low enough to ensure full
drainage away from the car,

441
00:19:34,263 --> 00:19:35,161
or else, kaboom.

442
00:19:35,163 --> 00:19:36,363
Guys, the heat

443
00:19:36,365 --> 00:19:38,765
is getting up to about
130 degrees, give or take.

444
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:40,901
We're gonna have enough
force to penetrate the pan?

445
00:19:40,903 --> 00:19:42,736
Standard PSI is 55,000,

446
00:19:42,738 --> 00:19:45,138
comparable to an M40A1
sniper rifle.

447
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,840
Your margin of error
is 2.2 inches

448
00:19:46,842 --> 00:19:48,041
to the left, and
two to the right.

449
00:19:48,043 --> 00:19:50,210
A syringe dart shot
out of a water hose, guys.

450
00:19:50,212 --> 00:19:51,378
I just don't know.

451
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,646
Chief, I just don't care.

452
00:19:52,648 --> 00:19:55,415
Fire in the hole,
so to speak.

453
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:00,220
How we doing?

454
00:20:00,222 --> 00:20:02,422
Ever hear of adding fuel
to the fire?

455
00:20:02,424 --> 00:20:03,924
We just did the opposite.

456
00:20:03,926 --> 00:20:06,326
Nothing left to burn--
it'll be out in seconds.

457
00:20:09,297 --> 00:20:11,164
The car's shifting.

458
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,832
It's the weight loss
from the drained oil.

459
00:20:12,834 --> 00:20:14,367
Uh, Walter,
compensate for the weight.

460
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:16,603
Lean the seat back
as far as you can.

461
00:20:16,605 --> 00:20:18,605
Okay. Okay.

462
00:20:29,618 --> 00:20:31,518
Yeah, that wasn't a scream
of fear, that was pain.

463
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,686
What's going on
down there?

464
00:20:32,688 --> 00:20:34,554
Well, the good news is...

465
00:20:34,556 --> 00:20:37,123
with the shift in
the car, I'm no longer impaled.

466
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:40,160
The bad news is
there's a-a great degree

467
00:20:40,162 --> 00:20:42,295
of bright red blood just

468
00:20:42,297 --> 00:20:44,531
spewing out... my wound.

469
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:46,466
That sounds like an
arterial bleeder.

470
00:20:46,468 --> 00:20:49,102
That shard of guardrail must
have been in the spleen.

471
00:20:49,104 --> 00:20:51,905
The blood coagulated around it;
now it's been ripped out.

472
00:20:51,907 --> 00:20:53,264
How long does he have?

473
00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:55,426
If he's really bleeding
out, four minutes.

474
00:21:05,535 --> 00:21:08,092
Walter, you got to get pressure
against that wound to stem

475
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:11,208
- the bleeding.
- I am. It's not...

476
00:21:11,209 --> 00:21:12,976
it's not working.

477
00:21:12,978 --> 00:21:14,611
He doesn't sound good.

478
00:21:14,613 --> 00:21:16,512
Hey, Walter!
Walter, listen to me!

479
00:21:16,514 --> 00:21:18,681
You have to fight the urge
to close your eyes.

480
00:21:18,683 --> 00:21:20,650
Do not close your eyes.

481
00:21:20,652 --> 00:21:22,118
Find Paige.

482
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,186
We're losing him.

483
00:21:23,188 --> 00:21:24,787
You're the doctor.
Do something!

484
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:26,623
Can't exactly cauterize
the wound from here,

485
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,324
Sylvester.

486
00:21:28,326 --> 00:21:30,093
Or can I?

487
00:21:30,095 --> 00:21:32,228
Holy crap, am I smart.

488
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,663
Walter, I got an idea
to fix your bleeding,

489
00:21:33,665 --> 00:21:35,932
but it won't work if you die
before I can implement it.

490
00:21:35,934 --> 00:21:37,967
So you have to stay conscious.

491
00:21:37,969 --> 00:21:40,370
Wal-Walter, Walter, hey, hey,

492
00:21:40,372 --> 00:21:42,338
you have to stay awake
so I can get

493
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,675
a good look at your wound.

494
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:10,400
You okay in there, son?

495
00:22:10,402 --> 00:22:11,834
Just trying to stay awake.

496
00:22:11,836 --> 00:22:13,169
Okay, hey,

497
00:22:13,171 --> 00:22:14,604
Walter, I can see the wound.

498
00:22:14,606 --> 00:22:16,739
It is bad. You're
gonna have to cauterize it,

499
00:22:16,741 --> 00:22:19,275
'cause my arms
are not nearly long enough.

500
00:22:19,277 --> 00:22:21,778
Listen carefully.
Find a thin piece of metal.

501
00:22:27,017 --> 00:22:28,718
I see a pen.

502
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,054
Okay. Reach for it slowly.

503
00:22:32,857 --> 00:22:34,490
Oh, boy.

504
00:22:37,261 --> 00:22:38,394
It's silver.

505
00:22:38,396 --> 00:22:40,596
Oh, yeah, of course Elia
would have a silver pen,

506
00:22:40,598 --> 00:22:42,532
rich jerk, but that's good.

507
00:22:42,534 --> 00:22:44,267
'Cause silver
conducts heat fast.

508
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:47,503
Now, press in
the cigarette lighter.

509
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:53,609
You okay back there?

510
00:22:53,611 --> 00:22:57,680
Huh? You want me to put
that science CD in you like?

511
00:23:00,884 --> 00:23:03,953
Sweetheart,
I know you're upset...

512
00:23:03,955 --> 00:23:05,421
It's not finished.

513
00:23:05,423 --> 00:23:06,756
What isn't, sweetheart?

514
00:23:06,758 --> 00:23:09,325
The rocket.
Walter and I need to finish it,

515
00:23:09,327 --> 00:23:11,694
but you won't let us.

516
00:23:11,696 --> 00:23:13,496
I'm gonna miss him.

517
00:23:14,364 --> 00:23:15,531
I know.

518
00:23:15,533 --> 00:23:17,600
Me, too.

519
00:23:17,602 --> 00:23:19,368
Don't leave it there too long.

520
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,437
We need it to be hot,
not glowing.

521
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:23,139
Yeah? All right.

522
00:23:23,141 --> 00:23:24,574
Fantastic.

523
00:23:24,576 --> 00:23:25,875
That's perfect.

524
00:23:25,877 --> 00:23:27,510
Walter, Walter, hey!

525
00:23:27,512 --> 00:23:29,412
Keep those peepers
popped, buddy.

526
00:23:29,414 --> 00:23:30,980
Okay, now here's
the rough par.

527
00:23:30,982 --> 00:23:32,348
I can't watch this.

528
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,717
Okay, Walter, you need
to press the pen

529
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:36,953
into the wound
past the rib cage.

530
00:23:36,955 --> 00:23:39,388
When you feel the spleen...
How do I know it's the spleen?

531
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,891
the pen will stop moving
and you'll feel the pulses

532
00:23:41,893 --> 00:23:44,994
of the artery transmitted
through the pen.

533
00:23:44,996 --> 00:23:45,703
Oh, man.

534
00:23:45,727 --> 00:23:48,009
When you feel the spleen
touch the hot metal

535
00:23:48,066 --> 00:23:50,700
against the organ
in short little bursts,

536
00:23:50,702 --> 00:23:53,002
it'll stop the bleeding, but
it'll preserve the tissue.

537
00:23:53,004 --> 00:23:54,237
You can do this, son.

538
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,378
Walter,
no matter how bad it hurts,

539
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,646
you got to stay still,

540
00:24:03,648 --> 00:24:05,281
or that car's gonna fall.

541
00:24:05,283 --> 00:24:07,517
Toby...

542
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:11,254
do you remember the '07...
World Series of Poker when, uh,

543
00:24:11,256 --> 00:24:13,689
when... you made me go
to Vegas with you?

544
00:24:13,691 --> 00:24:15,224
How could I forget?

545
00:24:15,226 --> 00:24:17,827
And you m-made me s-stay
in that...

546
00:24:17,829 --> 00:24:21,097
that crappy hotel room...
off the Strip?

547
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:23,667
God, this hurts.

548
00:24:23,668 --> 00:24:25,802
El Ranchorito.
Wasn't <i>that</i> bad.

549
00:24:25,804 --> 00:24:28,704
And you won that...
gangster's bankroll in that...

550
00:24:28,706 --> 00:24:30,306
back-alley crap game?

551
00:24:30,308 --> 00:24:32,375
He and his friends...

552
00:24:32,377 --> 00:24:33,776
chased after us with,

553
00:24:33,778 --> 00:24:37,513
: uh... with crowbars
for nine blocks?

554
00:24:37,515 --> 00:24:40,283
We had to hitchhike...
back to L.A.?

555
00:24:40,285 --> 00:24:42,652
I remember every
minute of it, Walt.

556
00:24:42,654 --> 00:24:45,421
It was one of the best weekends
of my life.

557
00:24:46,824 --> 00:24:48,624
I need to take a look.
How much longer?

558
00:24:48,626 --> 00:24:50,326
Can you move your hand away?

559
00:24:52,931 --> 00:24:54,430
Okay.

560
00:24:54,432 --> 00:24:56,432
Yeah, the bleeding
has stopped substantially.

561
00:24:56,434 --> 00:24:58,835
Great work, pal,
great work. Now...

562
00:24:58,837 --> 00:25:01,571
take a beat
and catch your breath.

563
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:06,909
Nice work, Doc.

564
00:25:06,911 --> 00:25:09,779
The way he's telling the stories
from back in the day,

565
00:25:09,781 --> 00:25:12,515
it's like he's
almost at his own wake.

566
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:14,851
We got to get him
out of there.

567
00:25:14,853 --> 00:25:16,619
He might be giving up.

568
00:25:16,621 --> 00:25:19,589
Okay. This is our gate.

569
00:25:19,591 --> 00:25:22,225
Now we need to get you
some yogurt and fruit,

570
00:25:22,227 --> 00:25:26,796
because I assume you'll find airplane
food lacking in nutritional content.

571
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:29,465
What do you want from the newsstand,
Discover or <i>Smithsonian?</i>

572
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:30,467
Ralph.

573
00:25:30,468 --> 00:25:32,001
Which magazine do you want?

574
00:25:32,003 --> 00:25:36,005
The Cliffside rescue attempt on
Mulholland Drive is underway

575
00:25:36,007 --> 00:25:39,508
to save Walter O'Brien, head of
the genius problem-solving team

576
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,543
known as Scorpion.

577
00:25:40,545 --> 00:25:42,511
Oh, my God!

578
00:25:42,513 --> 00:25:45,014
Come on!

579
00:25:48,085 --> 00:25:50,553
I can't find anything
on the news!

580
00:25:50,555 --> 00:25:51,787
Mom?
What?!

581
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:52,822
I'm sorry.

582
00:25:52,824 --> 00:25:54,123
Is Walter gonna be okay?

583
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:55,691
Yes. Of course he will be.
I just need

584
00:25:55,693 --> 00:25:56,792
to call the guys.

585
00:25:56,794 --> 00:25:58,527
Damn it, I left my bag
at the airport!

586
00:25:58,529 --> 00:25:59,662
Hold on, Ralph.

587
00:26:01,098 --> 00:26:03,199
Copy that.
Relaying the data now.

588
00:26:03,201 --> 00:26:04,533
Those were my climbers.

589
00:26:04,535 --> 00:26:07,003
Recent changes in the position
of the car are forcing them

590
00:26:07,005 --> 00:26:08,938
to change their course.
They can't just go straight up.

591
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,641
They have to try to up and around.
How long?

592
00:26:11,643 --> 00:26:13,175
22 minutes minimum.

593
00:26:13,177 --> 00:26:15,144
Walter might not
have that long.

594
00:26:15,146 --> 00:26:17,213
Thanks to him
shifting around in there,

595
00:26:17,215 --> 00:26:19,081
the ground's moved
under the car in a way

596
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:20,816
that even the slightest change
in weight distribution

597
00:26:20,818 --> 00:26:22,451
can upset the balance

598
00:26:22,453 --> 00:26:23,453
and he's a goner.

599
00:26:23,454 --> 00:26:24,720
Well, that's good to know.

600
00:26:24,722 --> 00:26:26,822
I'm sorry, pal--
I thought the phone was off.

601
00:26:26,824 --> 00:26:28,024
That's okay.

602
00:26:28,026 --> 00:26:29,525
Any luck finding Paige?

603
00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:34,397
Uh, still nothing, buddy.

604
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:36,699
I called again--
not answering her phone.

605
00:26:36,701 --> 00:26:38,668
Too bad we don't have
a Southernell

606
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,670
two-slot pay phone circa 1991.

607
00:26:40,672 --> 00:26:41,904
Stop it!

608
00:26:41,906 --> 00:26:43,773
I know what you're doing--
you're talking

609
00:26:43,775 --> 00:26:46,175
about that pay phone
I rigged for free calls

610
00:26:46,177 --> 00:26:47,610
when we first opened the garage

611
00:26:47,612 --> 00:26:49,345
'cause we
couldn't afford a phone.

612
00:26:49,347 --> 00:26:51,747
Well, you sure fixed that
for us, didn't you?

613
00:26:51,749 --> 00:26:53,182
Okay, I'm not having it!

614
00:26:53,184 --> 00:26:56,052
Okay? I will not let you
eulogize a memory of you and me.

615
00:26:56,054 --> 00:26:58,988
You have three geniuses up here
putting their heads together.

616
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,090
We will figure this out,
you will not die--

617
00:27:01,092 --> 00:27:03,759
the situation is under control!

618
00:27:06,898 --> 00:27:09,031
Sylvester,
you're into bird-watching--

619
00:27:09,033 --> 00:27:11,133
how much does a crow weigh?

620
00:27:11,135 --> 00:27:12,835
Decent size:
1.2 pounds.

621
00:27:12,837 --> 00:27:13,970
Why?

622
00:27:13,972 --> 00:27:15,738
One just landed on my hood.

623
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:22,178
A pound of pressure on the lever

624
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,946
at the greatest distance
from the fulcrum

625
00:27:23,948 --> 00:27:25,881
can create enough force
to start the beginning

626
00:27:25,883 --> 00:27:27,850
of a slide which results
in gravitational pull.

627
00:27:27,852 --> 00:27:29,885
Which results
in car overboard.

628
00:27:29,887 --> 00:27:32,221
If that bird flies off...

629
00:27:32,223 --> 00:27:33,823
Walter dies.

630
00:27:41,017 --> 00:27:42,718
Guys, the car's starting
to tilt...

631
00:27:43,301 --> 00:27:44,701
ever so downward.

632
00:27:44,703 --> 00:27:46,536
Copy that.
We're aware of the situation,

633
00:27:46,538 --> 00:27:47,804
and handling it.

634
00:27:48,873 --> 00:27:51,240
How are we
handling this?

635
00:27:51,242 --> 00:27:53,076
Uh, the fire department's
got a hook and ladder

636
00:27:53,078 --> 00:27:55,078
parked up around that bend.

637
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,913
It would never extend out
far enough.

638
00:27:56,915 --> 00:27:59,482
I know, but I saw construction work
down the road from here.

639
00:27:59,484 --> 00:28:01,818
I have an idea, and it works on
the same principle!

640
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,319
Hey,

641
00:28:03,321 --> 00:28:06,155
if you fly off, the reverse
torque from weight distribution

642
00:28:06,157 --> 00:28:08,357
will cause my death.

643
00:28:09,326 --> 00:28:12,795
You don't really care
about that, do you?

644
00:28:12,797 --> 00:28:14,497
He's talking
to the bird.

645
00:28:14,499 --> 00:28:16,099
Not the best sign.

646
00:28:16,101 --> 00:28:19,068
<i>Rescue crews are at a loss</i>
<i>of how to extract the man</i>

647
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:21,204
identified as one Walter O'Brien
from the car

648
00:28:21,206 --> 00:28:23,272
before it completes its fall
down the cliff.

649
00:28:23,274 --> 00:28:24,874
With me is Tomas Kolbrenner,

650
00:28:24,876 --> 00:28:27,276
USC professor
of structural engineering,

651
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:29,112
who has studied photographs
and video of the scene.

652
00:28:29,114 --> 00:28:32,048
Mr. Kolbrenner, given the situation,
what's the likelihood Come on, go faster!

653
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,416
of a successful rescue?

654
00:28:33,418 --> 00:28:34,717
Well, I hate to morbid, Jackie,

655
00:28:34,719 --> 00:28:36,886
but I don't see a scenario
where Mr. O'Brien

656
00:28:36,888 --> 00:28:39,055
makes it out alive.

657
00:28:39,057 --> 00:28:41,924
Don't listen to them--
they don't know what Scorpion's

658
00:28:41,926 --> 00:28:42,926
capable of.

659
00:28:42,927 --> 00:28:44,093
Baby...

660
00:28:45,028 --> 00:28:48,264
He's my friend.

661
00:28:55,339 --> 00:28:58,007
<i>How's Tweety doing?</i>
<i>Staying put?</i>

662
00:28:58,009 --> 00:29:00,409
<i>For now. We have a plan?</i>

663
00:29:00,411 --> 00:29:02,912
Uh, yeah, Happy left here
like a bat out of hell,

664
00:29:02,914 --> 00:29:04,747
and you know her--
she says she's got an idea,

665
00:29:04,749 --> 00:29:07,049
she's got an idea.

666
00:29:07,051 --> 00:29:08,317
What is that?

667
00:29:10,854 --> 00:29:13,222
Her idea.

668
00:29:13,224 --> 00:29:15,491
You borrowed a crane
from a construction site?

669
00:29:15,493 --> 00:29:16,649
Not exactly.

670
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:18,562
You <i>stole</i> a crane
from a construction site?

671
00:29:18,563 --> 00:29:19,595
Exactly.

672
00:29:19,597 --> 00:29:21,697
Uh, Walt,
here's the plan.

673
00:29:21,699 --> 00:29:24,167
I am going to hook Cabe up
to the end of a crane,

674
00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:26,602
like a wrecking ball,
and swing him out

675
00:29:26,604 --> 00:29:28,104
over the canyon
to your car.

676
00:29:28,106 --> 00:29:29,639
He'll connect you
via safety line,

677
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:31,674
and we'll pull you both back in.

678
00:29:31,676 --> 00:29:34,710
Amazingly, not the craziest
thing that we've ever done.

679
00:29:34,712 --> 00:29:36,646
It's been a busy year.

680
00:29:36,648 --> 00:29:38,214
Okay, Walter,
you're gonna need

681
00:29:38,216 --> 00:29:40,950
to unlock the passenger-side
door so Cabe can get to you.

682
00:29:40,952 --> 00:29:42,952
But move with extreme caution
as to, you know,

683
00:29:42,954 --> 00:29:44,120
not get killed.

684
00:29:44,122 --> 00:29:45,188
Ugh, that is gonna hurt.

685
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,256
More than falling down
the side of a cliff?

686
00:29:47,258 --> 00:29:49,592
All right. Point taken.

687
00:29:51,461 --> 00:29:53,696
Okay.

688
00:29:53,698 --> 00:29:56,132
Now I got to fashion a harness
for you to wear.

689
00:29:56,134 --> 00:30:00,102
I'll get some Tech 12 cable
from Search and Rescue.

690
00:30:00,104 --> 00:30:01,971
Uh, Cabe.

691
00:30:01,973 --> 00:30:04,006
The car falls
when you're hooked to Walter

692
00:30:04,008 --> 00:30:06,442
and his body gets caught inside?

693
00:30:06,444 --> 00:30:09,545
The hoist line snaps
and you will go down with him.

694
00:30:11,348 --> 00:30:14,784
Just get the harness ready.

695
00:30:31,535 --> 00:30:33,402
Don't move, crow.

696
00:30:41,346 --> 00:30:43,412
What was that sound?

697
00:30:43,414 --> 00:30:45,147
His collarbone.

698
00:30:45,149 --> 00:30:46,816
Oh.

699
00:30:49,286 --> 00:30:50,653
Oh, no.

700
00:30:50,655 --> 00:30:52,388
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

701
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,023
You got to turn this around.

702
00:30:54,025 --> 00:30:55,858
My-my friend is on that cliff!
Ma'am,

703
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,760
there are no cars allowed
past this point. I need you

704
00:30:57,762 --> 00:30:59,328
to turn it back around.
All right. Okay.

705
00:31:03,767 --> 00:31:05,568
Okay, Ralph. Let's go.

706
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,536
Come on.

707
00:31:07,538 --> 00:31:08,905
Come on, let's go.

708
00:31:08,907 --> 00:31:10,773
Come on.

709
00:31:10,775 --> 00:31:12,808
Come on, Ralph.

710
00:31:13,777 --> 00:31:15,945
Okay, when we tell you to,
open the car door.

711
00:31:15,947 --> 00:31:17,947
The weight shift will cause
the car to instantly fall.

712
00:31:17,949 --> 00:31:19,982
But that won't matter because
Cabe will have already hooked

713
00:31:19,984 --> 00:31:21,684
your safety line to him.
The car falls

714
00:31:21,686 --> 00:31:23,853
while you hang safely in the air
with SuperGallo.

715
00:31:23,855 --> 00:31:26,622
Okay. Yeah.
I'm not going anywhere

716
00:31:26,624 --> 00:31:28,524
until I talk to Paige.

717
00:31:28,526 --> 00:31:30,359
Ground underneath that car is
getting more and more unstable.

718
00:31:30,361 --> 00:31:32,361
That bird can amscray
at any moment.

719
00:31:32,363 --> 00:31:34,597
We have got
to get this party started

720
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:37,066
as soon as Happy is done rigging
that harness.

721
00:31:37,068 --> 00:31:39,135
Toby,
there is a strong possibility

722
00:31:39,137 --> 00:31:40,670
that this thing does not work!

723
00:31:40,672 --> 00:31:43,673
If so, then I need to talk
to Paige and Ralph.

724
00:31:43,675 --> 00:31:46,876
He's not gonna open that door
until they get here.

725
00:31:46,878 --> 00:31:47,977
No matter what.

726
00:31:47,979 --> 00:31:49,011
How do you know?

727
00:31:49,013 --> 00:31:50,079
'Cause the last thing
Walter O'Brien

728
00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:52,048
wants to do before he dies

729
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,382
is state facts, and the fact

730
00:31:53,384 --> 00:31:54,517
he's tried
to tell us,

731
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:56,352
in his own way,
is that he loves us.

732
00:31:56,354 --> 00:31:58,888
So why do you think
he wants Paige here so badly?

733
00:32:01,926 --> 00:32:03,426
So I'm gonna feed the line
through the window

734
00:32:03,428 --> 00:32:05,161
and you're gonna hook
it around your waist.

735
00:32:05,163 --> 00:32:07,730
Cabe, if this thing doesn't
work, then you need to tell her.

736
00:32:07,732 --> 00:32:10,166
Tell Paige what, son?

737
00:32:10,168 --> 00:32:11,600
Tell her that I...

738
00:32:12,202 --> 00:32:13,469
Oh, no!

739
00:32:13,471 --> 00:32:14,837
Bird's on the move! Move!

740
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:17,173
He flies off, it's all over.

741
00:32:17,175 --> 00:32:19,442
Happy,
how much longer?

742
00:32:19,444 --> 00:32:21,043
I'm not ready!

743
00:32:21,045 --> 00:32:23,212
Well, get ready.

744
00:32:30,187 --> 00:32:31,687
Happy, we got
to get going.

745
00:32:31,689 --> 00:32:33,356
I only have one line.
You need two.

746
00:32:33,358 --> 00:32:35,992
Not an option.
Get me out there now.

747
00:32:35,994 --> 00:32:38,527
Is this it, pal?
You're gonna fly off?

748
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:41,364
Well, you do what you
got to do, but...

749
00:32:41,366 --> 00:32:42,698
if you could just stay put

750
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,066
for a little bit longer,

751
00:32:44,068 --> 00:32:46,602
I'd-I'd really
appreciate it.

752
00:32:46,604 --> 00:32:48,471
The proximal half
of the bird's wings are flexing.

753
00:32:48,473 --> 00:32:50,439
It's preparing to fly.
And if I've picked up on that,

754
00:32:50,441 --> 00:32:51,607
so has Walter.

755
00:33:07,424 --> 00:33:09,592
Come on!

756
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,428
Walter!

757
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,497
Walter!

758
00:33:14,499 --> 00:33:16,932
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Walter.

759
00:33:16,934 --> 00:33:18,467
Paige,

760
00:33:18,469 --> 00:33:20,302
I just want you to know...

761
00:33:21,104 --> 00:33:21,604
No!

762
00:33:23,474 --> 00:33:24,206
Open the damn door!

763
00:33:27,445 --> 00:33:28,077
Walter!

764
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:29,779
No!

765
00:33:54,513 --> 00:33:56,247
I won't let go if you won't.

766
00:33:56,249 --> 00:33:57,715
Deal.

767
00:34:28,947 --> 00:34:31,549
I don't feel so well.

768
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:52,670
Radiology, 135. Radiology, 135.

769
00:34:52,672 --> 00:34:54,238
Hey. He awake yet?

770
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,173
Not yet.

771
00:34:56,175 --> 00:34:58,075
You brought
balloons.

772
00:34:58,077 --> 00:34:59,443
Everybody
likes balloons.

773
00:34:59,445 --> 00:35:01,145
What's he gonna do?
Knock 'em around the room

774
00:35:01,147 --> 00:35:03,848
with his broken ribs
and punctured spleen?

775
00:35:05,017 --> 00:35:06,817
Hey, everybody.

776
00:35:11,923 --> 00:35:13,591
If you're here about your car,
it's wrecked.

777
00:35:13,593 --> 00:35:15,126
Don't care
about the car.

778
00:35:15,128 --> 00:35:16,394
Just checking on Walter.

779
00:35:16,396 --> 00:35:18,696
I'm sorry. This is family only.

780
00:35:19,564 --> 00:35:21,065
Understood.

781
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:23,000
Will you at least let him know
that I stopped by?

782
00:35:23,002 --> 00:35:24,368
And if there's anything
that he needs...

783
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:27,305
You'll be right there to
try and steal him away again?

784
00:35:27,307 --> 00:35:29,473
After what I saw unfold
on TV today,

785
00:35:29,475 --> 00:35:31,642
breaking up a
family like this,

786
00:35:31,644 --> 00:35:33,010
that would
be criminal.

787
00:35:33,012 --> 00:35:34,892
Please just keep me posted
as to how he's doing.

788
00:35:38,483 --> 00:35:40,384
But if you would <i>all</i> like
to come

789
00:35:40,386 --> 00:35:42,620
work with me, I'd be crazy
not to have a group like you

790
00:35:42,622 --> 00:35:44,255
working for
my think tank.

791
00:35:44,257 --> 00:35:46,123
Food for thought?

792
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:46,957
Nope.

793
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:47,959
Uh-uh.

794
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,060
No way.

795
00:35:49,062 --> 00:35:51,562
Scorpion appreciates the offer,
but, um,

796
00:35:51,564 --> 00:35:52,897
we're not corporate material.
We're a team.

797
00:35:52,899 --> 00:35:55,666
We work out of a garage,
not a tank.

798
00:35:55,668 --> 00:35:57,401
And we work alone.

799
00:35:57,403 --> 00:35:59,603
Fair enough.

800
00:36:00,972 --> 00:36:05,609
Um, what's this
"we" stuff, pilgrim?

801
00:36:05,611 --> 00:36:07,878
Yeah. What about Maine?

802
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,281
Uh, I don't know, Ralphy.

803
00:36:10,283 --> 00:36:12,783
What about Maine?
It's cold and wet.

804
00:36:15,755 --> 00:36:16,821
Is this the
O'Brien party?

805
00:36:16,823 --> 00:36:18,322
What gave it away?
Was it the balloons?

806
00:36:18,324 --> 00:36:19,757
Hi. How's he doing?

807
00:36:19,759 --> 00:36:22,226
He's weak and tired but stable.
He's gonna be okay.

808
00:36:23,762 --> 00:36:24,962
Can we see him?

809
00:36:24,964 --> 00:36:26,564
It's way past visitation,

810
00:36:26,566 --> 00:36:28,599
so it'll have to be quick.
Follow me.

811
00:36:36,075 --> 00:36:37,541
Hey, guys.

812
00:36:37,543 --> 00:36:41,946
Hey yourself,
Mario Andretti.

813
00:36:41,948 --> 00:36:44,248
The sawbones patch you up okay?

814
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,017
Yeah, I've felt better.
But... never better.

815
00:36:47,019 --> 00:36:48,419
If that makes sense.

816
00:36:48,421 --> 00:36:50,654
Doesn't.
But you've had a head injury.

817
00:36:50,656 --> 00:36:52,757
Eh.

818
00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:55,326
Hey, you brought balloons.

819
00:36:55,328 --> 00:36:56,360
Thank you.

820
00:36:56,362 --> 00:36:58,028
See?

821
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:00,030
Sly, do you remember
that time that...

822
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,565
we filled that balloon
with tapioca

823
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:02,900
and then we took
that catapult...

824
00:37:02,902 --> 00:37:05,936
Walter, you don't need
to take me down memory lane.

825
00:37:05,938 --> 00:37:08,105
But thanks.

826
00:37:08,107 --> 00:37:09,774
I love you, too.

827
00:37:09,776 --> 00:37:12,109
Hey. Hey, pal.

828
00:37:14,913 --> 00:37:16,981
It's good to see you.

829
00:37:16,983 --> 00:37:18,983
It's good to see you, too.

830
00:37:20,018 --> 00:37:21,285
Okay.

831
00:37:21,287 --> 00:37:23,187
It's morphine
time, which means

832
00:37:23,189 --> 00:37:24,789
he's gonna be out like a light
in about a minute.

833
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:27,558
It's time for good-byes.
All right.

834
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,795
We will see you back at work
when you're all better, okay?

835
00:37:33,832 --> 00:37:35,833
Back to work?

836
00:37:35,835 --> 00:37:38,202
Yeah. Back at work.

837
00:37:42,774 --> 00:37:44,608
That put a smile on his face.

838
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,043
That and the drugs.

839
00:37:46,045 --> 00:37:48,512
Bye.

840
00:37:53,452 --> 00:37:55,719
Okay. I'm gonna
go see Megan.

841
00:37:55,721 --> 00:37:57,488
She's worried sick
about her brother.

842
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:59,056
I'm gonna hit
the Epsom salts.

843
00:37:59,058 --> 00:38:01,325
Swinging off a crane does
a number on your back.

844
00:38:01,327 --> 00:38:04,228
I... I think might
hang back for a bit

845
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,629
in case Walter needs anything.

846
00:38:05,631 --> 00:38:08,165
He's doped-up
like a Tijuana drug mule.

847
00:38:08,167 --> 00:38:10,801
Just in case.
Happy, would you mind keeping

848
00:38:10,803 --> 00:38:12,036
an eye on Ralph
for a few hours?

849
00:38:12,038 --> 00:38:13,204
Not if he
doesn't mind

850
00:38:13,206 --> 00:38:16,474
getting his butt kicked
in Constructo-Battle.

851
00:38:17,342 --> 00:38:19,643
You want to babysit with me?

852
00:38:19,645 --> 00:38:21,245
Of course I would.

853
00:38:21,247 --> 00:38:24,348
Hey, be good. They've
had a long day, okay?

854
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,584
Thanks for not

855
00:38:26,586 --> 00:38:28,552
making me leave them.

856
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:42,166
Uh, is it all right
if I stay for a while?

857
00:38:42,168 --> 00:38:44,702
Sure. But he's
down for the count.

858
00:38:44,704 --> 00:38:47,972
He won't be awake for hours.
Okay.

859
00:38:58,884 --> 00:39:03,187
Thought for a moment today
I'd seen you for the last time.

860
00:39:03,189 --> 00:39:06,790
It really bothered me
that if that had happened,

861
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:10,995
our final memory together
would've been... a fight.

862
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:16,178
I'm really glad
that wasn't the case.

863
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:19,381
Because...

864
00:39:36,232 --> 00:39:40,435
Because I really care about you,
Walter.
