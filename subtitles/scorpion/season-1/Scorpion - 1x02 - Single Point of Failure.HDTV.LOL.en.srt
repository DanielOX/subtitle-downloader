1
00:00:05,688 --> 00:00:07,289
<i>My name is Walter O'Brien.</i>

2
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:11,726
<i>I have the fourth highest IQ</i>
<i><i><i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

3
00:00:11,728 --> 00:00:13,461
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

4
00:00:13,463 --> 00:00:15,997
<i>When I was 11,
the FBI</i> <i>arrested me for hacking NASA</i>

5
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:18,700
<i>to get their blueprints</i> <i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

6
00:00:18,702 --> 00:00:20,935
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

7
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,404
<i>tackling worldwide threats</i>

8
00:00:22,406 --> 00:00:23,938
<i>only we can solve.</i>

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,673
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

10
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:27,442
<i>Sylvester's a human calculator.</i>

11
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,844
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

12
00:00:29,846 --> 00:00:32,080
<i>Agent Cabe Gallo's</i> <i>our government handler.</i>

13
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:33,114
<i>And Paige?</i>

14
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,315
<i>Well, Paige isn't like us.</i>

15
00:00:34,317 --> 00:00:35,416
<i>She's normal</i>

16
00:00:35,418 --> 00:00:36,751
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

17
00:00:36,753 --> 00:00:38,052
<i>while we help her understand</i>

18
00:00:38,054 --> 00:00:39,354
<i>her genius son.</i>

19
00:00:39,356 --> 00:00:41,422
<i>Together, we are Scorpion.</i>

20
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:46,494
<i>Of the six</i> three-digit integers

21
00:00:46,496 --> 00:00:47,996
on the board,

22
00:00:47,998 --> 00:00:49,931
which are divisible by four?

23
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:51,566
O'Brien! All of them.

24
00:00:51,568 --> 00:00:55,236
Not even in the outer reaches of Pluto,

25
00:00:55,238 --> 00:00:57,772
where you generally reside,

26
00:00:57,774 --> 00:01:00,241
is 703 divisible by four.

27
00:01:00,243 --> 00:01:05,012
703 divided by four is 175.75.

28
00:01:05,014 --> 00:01:07,348
They can all be divided by four,

29
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,083
just with the remainders.

30
00:01:10,185 --> 00:01:12,019
You didn't define your terms.

31
00:01:17,226 --> 00:01:18,192
O'Brien!

32
00:01:18,194 --> 00:01:20,361
Stay.

33
00:01:26,268 --> 00:01:29,103
You show a growing disdain for authority.

34
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:30,704
It's concerning.

35
00:01:30,706 --> 00:01:32,506
Hands on the desk.

36
00:01:33,742 --> 00:01:36,377
Hands on the desk.

37
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,325
There's no drill scheduled.

38
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:45,420
Move out, O'Brien.

39
00:01:51,926 --> 00:01:54,486
Walter. Let's go.

40
00:01:57,465 --> 00:01:59,433
You could get arrested for
pulling the fire alarm.

41
00:01:59,435 --> 00:02:01,268
He should get arrested
for daring to strike you.

42
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,369
He'll just call Dad.

43
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:03,904
I'll take care of that, too.

44
00:02:03,906 --> 00:02:05,939
Megan, someday I'll pay you back.

45
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:07,141
I'll take a Lamborghini,

46
00:02:07,143 --> 00:02:08,742
bright yellow.

47
00:02:08,744 --> 00:02:10,024
Race ya!

48
00:02:29,898 --> 00:02:30,997
Sorry I'm late.

49
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:32,699
Uh, Ralph's sick again.

50
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:34,568
That's two days in a row, huh, pal?

51
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:35,902
Yeah, his fever won't break.

52
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,337
I'm gonna take him to the doctor at 10:00

53
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:38,505
and then my neighbor can watch him.

54
00:02:38,507 --> 00:02:41,041
- If that's okay?
- Mm-hmm.

55
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:42,709
Are you okay? You don't look so...

56
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:43,944
Never been healthier.

57
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:46,880
So... mail arrived.

58
00:02:46,882 --> 00:02:49,583
Menus and... paychecks.

59
00:02:50,249 --> 00:02:52,285
Mo' money. Mo' problems.

60
00:02:52,287 --> 00:02:53,653
Or so I've heard in the rapper song.

61
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:56,232
Well, rappers may have 99 or so problems

62
00:02:56,258 --> 00:02:58,591
but misplacing paychecks is not one of them.

63
00:02:58,593 --> 00:03:00,427
LAX cleared our debt.

64
00:03:00,429 --> 00:03:01,728
This is our first fresh cash.

65
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,064
Toby, are you gonna be okay with this?

66
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:05,331
I'm way ahead of you.

67
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,300
High stress levels triggers
my gambling addictions.

68
00:03:07,302 --> 00:03:09,636
If my levels go up...

69
00:03:10,906 --> 00:03:13,907
See, it reminds me I'm being a jackass.

70
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:15,208
Hell, I could do that for you.

71
00:03:16,477 --> 00:03:17,443
I'll be upstairs.

72
00:03:17,445 --> 00:03:19,145
Hey, seriously, what's wrong?

73
00:03:19,147 --> 00:03:20,113
I'm fine.

74
00:03:20,115 --> 00:03:21,981
Clearly.

75
00:03:24,693 --> 00:03:27,820
So is Ralph by the way.

76
00:03:27,822 --> 00:03:29,689
Yep.

77
00:03:29,691 --> 00:03:31,224
He hacked the thermometer.

78
00:03:31,226 --> 00:03:33,192
Recalibrated the digital display.

79
00:03:33,194 --> 00:03:35,495
He did what? Ralph?

80
00:03:35,497 --> 00:03:36,996
He hates school.

81
00:03:36,998 --> 00:03:38,498
We all did.

82
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,501
Especially those of us
with math proficiency.

83
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:44,704
You know, to get through the day,

84
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:46,239
I would look at the clock

85
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:47,573
and I'd create formulas

86
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:49,142
expressing trigonomic functions

87
00:03:49,144 --> 00:03:50,543
based on the clock hands.

88
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:52,979
My sister suggested that
to me a long time ago.

89
00:03:52,981 --> 00:03:54,513
Oh, I didn't know you had a sister.

90
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:56,082
Is she...

91
00:03:56,084 --> 00:03:57,283
enabled, too?

92
00:03:57,285 --> 00:03:58,484
Not like us.

93
00:03:58,486 --> 00:04:00,486
But in her own way.

94
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:06,592
Ralph... backpack.

95
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:10,096
What's his story today?

96
00:04:10,098 --> 00:04:11,530
Don't know. But that is only

97
00:04:11,532 --> 00:04:13,466
the second time he's ever
mentioned his sister.

98
00:04:16,369 --> 00:04:18,971
Still stalking your ex-wife?

99
00:04:18,973 --> 00:04:20,773
Ex-fiancée.

100
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:22,007
And I am not "stalking."

101
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:22,842
I'm keeping current.

102
00:04:22,844 --> 00:04:24,410
- Uh-huh.
- Cabe called.

103
00:04:24,412 --> 00:04:26,345
We're all going to meet
the governor of California.

104
00:04:26,347 --> 00:04:27,847
My back-tax status

105
00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:28,948
with the state isn't exactly

106
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,049
what you'd call good.

107
00:04:30,051 --> 00:04:31,216
What's this about?

108
00:04:31,218 --> 00:04:32,718
He said hurry, all right? So let's hurry.

109
00:04:33,297 --> 00:04:35,254
Paige, Ralph's school is on the way,

110
00:04:35,256 --> 00:04:36,388
so we'll drop him off.

111
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,589
Come on, guys!

112
00:04:44,431 --> 00:04:46,265
The new car rides nice.

113
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:48,100
Steady paycheck equals safe car for my kid.

114
00:04:48,102 --> 00:04:49,401
Heavy security.

115
00:04:49,403 --> 00:04:51,671
Way more than you'd expect
for the governor.

116
00:04:51,697 --> 00:04:53,238
Walter, why is there a van

117
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,841
from the Center for Disease Control here?

118
00:04:54,842 --> 00:04:55,874
I don't know.

119
00:04:55,876 --> 00:04:56,975
We'll find out pretty soon.

120
00:04:56,977 --> 00:04:58,143
Uh, they handle diseases that

121
00:04:58,145 --> 00:04:59,645
wipe out civilizations.

122
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:01,246
Diseases that have no cure.

123
00:05:01,248 --> 00:05:02,114
And they're, they're here.

124
00:05:02,116 --> 00:05:03,615
It's gonna be fine, come on.

125
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:05,751
Good, you're here. Follow me.

126
00:05:05,753 --> 00:05:07,986
Wait, why are you wearing a
surgical mask around your neck?

127
00:05:07,988 --> 00:05:09,454
What exactly are you
protecting yourself from?

128
00:05:09,456 --> 00:05:10,455
Relax.

129
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:11,890
They put up a quarantine tent.

130
00:05:11,892 --> 00:05:14,426
A quarantine tent?

131
00:05:14,428 --> 00:05:15,660
I will be in the car.

132
00:05:15,662 --> 00:05:17,796
Uh, Mr. Gallo, sir?

133
00:05:17,798 --> 00:05:18,930
Is there a very terrible,

134
00:05:18,932 --> 00:05:20,065
possibly communicable disease in this home?

135
00:05:21,468 --> 00:05:22,601
Sorry.

136
00:05:22,603 --> 00:05:24,603
Stress levels are a tad elevated right now.

137
00:05:24,605 --> 00:05:27,272
Weird, phone's off but
I still hear a donkey.

138
00:05:27,274 --> 00:05:29,274
Today's not the
day to be screwing off.

139
00:05:29,276 --> 00:05:30,516
You two go wait with Sylvester.

140
00:05:41,754 --> 00:05:44,022
There's a computer I need you to look at.

141
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:48,193
That poor little girl.

142
00:06:03,648 --> 00:06:04,647
Who's that kid?

143
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:06,049
That's a need-to-know.

144
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:08,218
You know, what I need to know

145
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,652
is exactly what's going on.

146
00:06:09,654 --> 00:06:10,920
Otherwise, I can't help.

147
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:13,790
Guys, this is Governor Lane.

148
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:15,625
This is the man who can help my daughter?

149
00:06:15,627 --> 00:06:16,759
I'm gonna need to know

150
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:17,794
everything that's happening here.

151
00:06:17,796 --> 00:06:19,362
So governmental habits

152
00:06:19,364 --> 00:06:21,531
of proprietary knowledge and
"need to know..."

153
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:22,732
Jettison that nonsense

154
00:06:22,734 --> 00:06:24,701
or my efforts to help your child

155
00:06:24,703 --> 00:06:25,802
will be hampered.

156
00:06:25,804 --> 00:06:27,637
You have to forgive Mr. O'Brien.

157
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,572
He's brilliant but impolitic.

158
00:06:29,574 --> 00:06:31,207
Don't care what he is,

159
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:32,575
long as he helps.

160
00:06:32,577 --> 00:06:33,876
In here...

161
00:06:33,878 --> 00:06:36,346
We're really not trying to hamper anyone,

162
00:06:36,348 --> 00:06:38,514
but if the public hears "unknown virus,"

163
00:06:38,516 --> 00:06:39,816
it could cause panic.

164
00:06:39,818 --> 00:06:42,251
Especially if there's
a political motivation.

165
00:06:42,253 --> 00:06:44,220
What kind of virus?

166
00:06:44,222 --> 00:06:45,621
She tested negative for Hanta,

167
00:06:45,623 --> 00:06:47,190
Rift Valley, Ebola...

168
00:06:47,192 --> 00:06:49,392
- Eastern equine encephalitis? 
- Also negative.

169
00:06:49,394 --> 00:06:53,396
She's only positive for the common cold.

170
00:06:53,398 --> 00:06:54,564
The CDC has a database

171
00:06:54,566 --> 00:06:56,699
of the rarest infective agents in the world.

172
00:06:56,701 --> 00:06:57,900
They're searching.

173
00:06:57,902 --> 00:06:59,235
Yeah, but while they search,

174
00:06:59,237 --> 00:07:01,237
Helena's kidneys, liver,
all shutting down.

175
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:03,799
Her fever's cli...

176
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:06,442
How long?

177
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:09,145
Doctors said she has

178
00:07:09,147 --> 00:07:11,509
- less than 24 hours.
- This is a medical problem.

179
00:07:11,535 --> 00:07:13,268
- Why am I here?
- First of all,

180
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,271
Governor, we're so sorry
this is happening to you.

181
00:07:16,273 --> 00:07:18,506
I have a child, too,

182
00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:20,508
and I can't imagine how you feel.

183
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,277
All we want to do is help.

184
00:07:24,013 --> 00:07:25,547
Thank you.

185
00:07:25,549 --> 00:07:26,829
Come with me.

186
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,724
We found this virus

187
00:07:35,726 --> 00:07:37,592
on Helena's laptop a few hours ago.

188
00:07:37,594 --> 00:07:39,494
Based on this, we're working
on the assumption

189
00:07:39,496 --> 00:07:41,763
that someone made Helena sick intentionally.

190
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:43,164
Targeting you, no doubt.

191
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,165
Any idea why?

192
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:46,034
Immigration reform? Three strikes?

193
00:07:46,036 --> 00:07:47,769
Those are my hot-button issues,

194
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:50,271
but would they prompt this kind
of hostility against my kid?

195
00:07:50,273 --> 00:07:52,440
We're compiling all threats,
past and present.

196
00:07:52,442 --> 00:07:53,942
The FBI, NSA,

197
00:07:53,944 --> 00:07:56,077
Homeland, all the top computer guys

198
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,146
been trying to trace the sender.

199
00:07:58,148 --> 00:08:00,581
The source bounced around to 15 countries.

200
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:01,549
We hit a wall.

201
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:02,917
Agent Gallo said that you

202
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:04,018
and your team were brilliant.

203
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,987
That you could find out who sent it.

204
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:07,155
All right.

205
00:08:07,157 --> 00:08:10,158
All of your devices are
on the same home network?

206
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,192
Yeah.

207
00:08:11,194 --> 00:08:12,460
Any other computer

208
00:08:12,462 --> 00:08:13,428
have this virus?

209
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,595
No.

210
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:16,864
Okay, so he directed the virus

211
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:18,866
to just Helena's computer.

212
00:08:18,868 --> 00:08:20,134
Anybody else in the house sick?

213
00:08:20,136 --> 00:08:21,869
- No.
- So...

214
00:08:21,871 --> 00:08:23,871
you, your wife and your staff...

215
00:08:23,873 --> 00:08:25,139
they've all been in her proximity?

216
00:08:25,141 --> 00:08:26,374
Yes. What are you getting at?

217
00:08:26,376 --> 00:08:27,475
Well, he could have taken out

218
00:08:27,477 --> 00:08:29,043
the whole home network,

219
00:08:29,045 --> 00:08:32,446
but he directed the computer
virus at just your child.

220
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:33,914
I don't think it's a coincidence

221
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,449
that no one else but Helena is ill.

222
00:08:35,451 --> 00:08:37,985
Wait, wait. What does this mean?

223
00:08:37,987 --> 00:08:40,187
Give the girl some cool air.
She's hot enough.

224
00:08:40,189 --> 00:08:41,622
What are you doing?

225
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:43,157
No!

226
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:45,359
You can't catch it.

227
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:46,727
None of us can.

228
00:08:46,729 --> 00:08:48,229
The virus he placed on the computer

229
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:49,630
is custom-built.

230
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:50,998
He did the same with your daughter,

231
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,133
- or why is no one else ill?
- You're saying

232
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:54,702
he custom-built a virus

233
00:08:54,704 --> 00:08:56,305
that would make just this child sick?

234
00:08:56,331 --> 00:08:58,138
Yeah. There's computer hacking,

235
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,506
and more recently, there's biohacking.

236
00:08:59,508 --> 00:09:00,941
Now, whoever infected

237
00:09:00,943 --> 00:09:03,310
the computer also infected your daughter.

238
00:09:03,312 --> 00:09:04,979
Until we find that person

239
00:09:04,981 --> 00:09:07,614
and know exactly what
biological agent he used,

240
00:09:07,616 --> 00:09:09,316
there's not gonna be any hope for a cure.

241
00:09:09,318 --> 00:09:10,818
Wait, wait, wait. Where are you going?

242
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,053
You can't just drop a
theory like that and leave.

243
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:14,555
Governor, the helplessness you feel

244
00:09:14,557 --> 00:09:16,390
will incline you to irrational behavior.

245
00:09:16,392 --> 00:09:18,058
So please,

246
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,694
resist the temptation to do anything stupid,

247
00:09:20,696 --> 00:09:22,162
like standing in my way.

248
00:09:22,164 --> 00:09:24,431
Let me do my job.

249
00:09:32,936 --> 00:09:37,615
sync and corrections by <font color="#FF0000">dreaMaker7</font>
www.addic7ed.com

250
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:44,692
I checked the AVG scanner,

251
00:09:44,694 --> 00:09:45,994
came up with nothing.

252
00:09:45,996 --> 00:09:48,229
If we can find a signature

253
00:09:48,231 --> 00:09:49,364
in the viral code,

254
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:50,498
it'll tell us who sent it.

255
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,499
Meaning we have nothing.

256
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:53,034
So far, Walt.

257
00:09:53,036 --> 00:09:54,202
Keep your shorts on.

258
00:09:54,204 --> 00:09:55,803
Governor's had

259
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:57,805
ten distinct threats
since he took the office.

260
00:09:57,807 --> 00:09:59,107
Four of the perps are locked up,

261
00:09:59,109 --> 00:10:01,761
- thus leaving six. 
- Guillermo Flacos?

262
00:10:01,787 --> 00:10:04,488
This is way too subtle
for a Mexican drug lord.

263
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,023
Oh, announcing your intent via e-mail?

264
00:10:06,025 --> 00:10:06,957
That's too subtle?

265
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,559
Personally, I would keep digging.

266
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:09,560
Any on the list

267
00:10:09,562 --> 00:10:10,828
have computer proficiency

268
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,629
<i>and</i> a knowledge of biophysics?

269
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:14,064
Well, that'll probably
narrow our list down to zero,

270
00:10:14,066 --> 00:10:14,998
but we'll keep digging.

271
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,700
What I want to understand is

272
00:10:16,702 --> 00:10:18,802
how you hack into a human being.

273
00:10:18,804 --> 00:10:20,404
I get your DNA from anywhere...
a coffee cup,

274
00:10:20,406 --> 00:10:21,672
a piece of gum...

275
00:10:21,674 --> 00:10:22,973
and then I study your genetics

276
00:10:22,975 --> 00:10:25,475
for a deficiency... say, uh, lung disease...

277
00:10:25,477 --> 00:10:26,943
and then I harness that genetic sequence

278
00:10:26,945 --> 00:10:29,279
onto a cold virus and
I blow it in your face.

279
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:30,947
Or into the air around you.

280
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:31,948
Toby, anything?

281
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:32,949
I traced the computer virus' code...

282
00:10:32,951 --> 00:10:34,317
Russia, China, Serbia.

283
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:35,786
It's no wonder the
government couldn't crack it.

284
00:10:35,788 --> 00:10:37,454
It uses none of the known building blocks.

285
00:10:37,456 --> 00:10:38,655
That's where you leave it, huh?

286
00:10:38,657 --> 00:10:39,956
With a young girl dying.

287
00:10:42,894 --> 00:10:45,562
All right, trace the IP header.

288
00:10:45,564 --> 00:10:46,997
Study it for patterns.

289
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:49,032
Maybe that'll get us somewhere.

290
00:10:56,701 --> 00:10:59,099
Don't say "I'm fine."

291
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,950
I was gonna say "I'll live."

292
00:11:01,064 --> 00:11:02,230
What's eating you?

293
00:11:02,232 --> 00:11:03,865
You're acting... I'm...

294
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:06,267
I'm tempted to use the word "emotional."

295
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:09,570
Particularly challenging problems create...

296
00:11:09,572 --> 00:11:11,505
impatience.

297
00:11:11,507 --> 00:11:13,841
But you were already off this
morning when you came in.

298
00:11:13,843 --> 00:11:15,209
You only became "impatient"

299
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:17,144
when you saw that little girl in her bed.

300
00:11:17,146 --> 00:11:19,280
Yeah, she reminded me of a
problem I couldn't solve.

301
00:11:19,282 --> 00:11:21,482
You realize the more evasive you are,
the more I'll press.

302
00:11:21,484 --> 00:11:22,608
All right.

303
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:27,764
As a child my, uh, sister got sick.

304
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,090
She survived.

305
00:11:29,092 --> 00:11:30,224
She's fine.

306
00:11:30,226 --> 00:11:33,127
Like you, all day.

307
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:35,629
All right, you know what?
I couldn't help her.

308
00:11:35,631 --> 00:11:37,198
It felt like she was being beaten,

309
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,899
and I was handcuffed.

310
00:11:38,901 --> 00:11:40,467
I couldn't solve her problem.

311
00:11:40,469 --> 00:11:43,771
And that's how you felt,
seeing that girl today?

312
00:11:43,773 --> 00:11:45,639
Walter!

313
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:48,272
- We've got something!
- Thank you for the bandage.

314
00:11:48,298 --> 00:11:49,943
All right, hide the mugs,

315
00:11:49,945 --> 00:11:52,079
I'm coming down!

316
00:12:13,038 --> 00:12:16,354
Okay, so we've successfully
mirrored the infected laptop.

317
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,347
The good news is... we traced the e-mail.

318
00:12:18,349 --> 00:12:19,581
The bad news... it doesn't justoue off

319
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,782
a few servers around the world.

320
00:12:20,784 --> 00:12:22,417
It's caught in an endless loop.

321
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:24,186
That is a dirty one, it's a good one.

322
00:12:24,188 --> 00:12:27,456
They're using a round-robin
on an IP address,

323
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,158
but it's too clever by half.
It narrows the source.

324
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,395
There's a pattern in the routing data.
You see that prefix?

325
00:12:33,397 --> 00:12:36,331
I know the place that uses this trick

326
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,233
to mask their e-mail origins.

327
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:39,515
Let's go.

328
00:12:50,847 --> 00:12:52,380
The sophistication
of the e-mail sent

329
00:12:52,382 --> 00:12:54,549
to the governor's daughter
stamps of this place.

330
00:12:54,551 --> 00:12:56,585
It's a known hacker petri dish.

331
00:12:56,587 --> 00:12:58,520
One guy makes an
advancement in deception,

332
00:12:58,522 --> 00:13:00,055
passes it on to another guy.

333
00:13:00,057 --> 00:13:02,757
It's how Silk Road stayed
online for so long.

334
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:04,926
You know that how?

335
00:13:06,963 --> 00:13:09,631
I think we both take the Fifth on that.

336
00:13:14,236 --> 00:13:16,371
Hey! Kill the music!

337
00:13:16,373 --> 00:13:17,972
Homeland Security!

338
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:20,842
I'm looking for the scumbag that sent

339
00:13:20,844 --> 00:13:23,545
the e-mail virus to the governor's daughter.

340
00:13:25,047 --> 00:13:26,714
That greaseball right there.

341
00:13:26,716 --> 00:13:28,750
His wide eyes and twitching hands

342
00:13:28,752 --> 00:13:31,085
go beyond the standard for
ten cans of Mountain Dew.

343
00:13:32,588 --> 00:13:34,889
You. Don't move.

344
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:45,366
Since when does Walter get physical?

345
00:13:45,368 --> 00:13:47,201
Um...

346
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:49,338
Never.

347
00:13:49,364 --> 00:13:51,345
Got the job on Craigslist.

348
00:13:51,441 --> 00:13:53,207
I never even met the client.

349
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,244
I think he broke some ribs.

350
00:13:56,246 --> 00:13:57,879
Mm-hmm.

351
00:13:57,881 --> 00:14:00,915
Refocus, or I'll break the rest of them.

352
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:02,116
How were you paid?

353
00:14:02,118 --> 00:14:04,218
Cash, to my P.O. Box.

354
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,087
Great. Untraceable.

355
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:07,822
I didn't know about any sick kid.

356
00:14:07,824 --> 00:14:09,724
I just sent a few anonymous e-mails,

357
00:14:09,726 --> 00:14:10,891
and I pocketed three grand.

358
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:11,892
Three <i>e-mails?</i>

359
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:12,994
More than one?

360
00:14:12,996 --> 00:14:14,862
I sent four total.

361
00:14:14,864 --> 00:14:17,298
All the same...
"It's your fault she's sick."

362
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,820
So, there<i> are</i> more victims?

363
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:22,837
Sir, we identified the three other victims.

364
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:24,305
They're all children.

365
00:14:24,307 --> 00:14:25,439
My God.

366
00:14:25,441 --> 00:14:26,640
They're all as sick as your daughter.

367
00:14:26,642 --> 00:14:29,009
Sons and daughters of Dwight Carrington,

368
00:14:29,011 --> 00:14:31,378
Victoria Cooper, and John Tuttle.

369
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,080
Wait, I know them.

370
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:36,183
You were all employees of
Vlaxco Pharmaceuticals in 2008.

371
00:14:36,185 --> 00:14:37,618
That's before I went into politics.

372
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,986
I only worked there for a
year in risk management.

373
00:14:38,988 --> 00:14:40,721
There's a drug called Trexicane.

374
00:14:40,723 --> 00:14:42,355
You all worked on its development.

375
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,025
Trexicane had promise as a cure for SMA...

376
00:14:45,027 --> 00:14:46,293
it's spinal muscular atrophy.

377
00:14:46,295 --> 00:14:48,896
It causes your muscles to waste away

378
00:14:48,898 --> 00:14:49,963
until you can't breathe anymore.

379
00:14:49,965 --> 00:14:51,699
The clinical trial was going really well

380
00:14:51,701 --> 00:14:53,500
until Vlaxco pulled the plug.

381
00:14:53,502 --> 00:14:55,469
Yeah, it also worked well on asthma.

382
00:14:55,471 --> 00:14:57,237
It was redeveloped solely for asthma.

383
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:58,539
Way more profit, huh?

384
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,661
Left all the SMA sufferers out in the cold.

385
00:15:03,044 --> 00:15:04,778
I spent months fielding
their angry phone calls.

386
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,146
I hated the job.

387
00:15:06,148 --> 00:15:08,188
But how it this related to Helena?

388
00:15:08,214 --> 00:15:11,151
We think that whoever attacked
Helena and these other children

389
00:15:11,153 --> 00:15:13,086
must be someone who suffered from SMA.

390
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:14,621
And they're trying to make us suffer, too?

391
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:16,056
What kind of mind thinks this way?

392
00:15:16,058 --> 00:15:17,491
Well, the kind that sends taunting e-mails

393
00:15:17,493 --> 00:15:19,159
alongside his deadly disease.

394
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:22,062
So, someone in enough
psychological pain to not care

395
00:15:22,064 --> 00:15:24,297
about how stupid that is
from a criminal standpoint.

396
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,101
Okay, is this headed towards ransom?

397
00:15:26,127 --> 00:15:28,301
More likely,
like his experience with Trexicane,

398
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,570
he's saying there is a cure out there,

399
00:15:30,572 --> 00:15:31,872
you just can't have it.

400
00:15:31,874 --> 00:15:34,075
This person would need
high scientific aptitude

401
00:15:34,076 --> 00:15:36,743
and access to cutting-edge
genetic sequencers.

402
00:15:36,745 --> 00:15:41,615
I got thousands of complaints
after the trial ended.

403
00:15:41,617 --> 00:15:43,583
Our best bet at finding
someone that angry enough

404
00:15:43,585 --> 00:15:45,752
to infect your daughter
and three other children

405
00:15:45,754 --> 00:15:47,020
is in the drug-trial records.

406
00:15:47,022 --> 00:15:49,256
None of the other families
work at Vlaxco anymore.

407
00:15:49,258 --> 00:15:50,256
You're the governor.

408
00:15:50,258 --> 00:15:52,459
Convince Vlaxco to hand them over.

409
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:54,728
I'll beg if I have to.

410
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,597
Where are Cabe and Sylvester?

411
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:58,631
You haven't eaten today.

412
00:15:58,633 --> 00:16:00,700
If you don't take care of yourself,

413
00:16:00,702 --> 00:16:01,968
then you can't help anyone else.

414
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,770
Are you barking at me now?

415
00:16:03,772 --> 00:16:06,332
I'm here to help you guys.

416
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,454
They're here.

417
00:16:11,612 --> 00:16:13,279
Hey, when are we getting the Vlaxco records?

418
00:16:13,281 --> 00:16:14,814
Vlaxco says they're not
gonna give them to us, yet.

419
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:17,150
They want to help,
but their lawyers are complaining

420
00:16:17,152 --> 00:16:18,585
about breaking patient confidentiality

421
00:16:18,587 --> 00:16:19,686
with a politician.

422
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:22,722
They say it'll take 12
hours to get us access.

423
00:16:22,724 --> 00:16:26,459
Walter, I saw the governor's daughter,

424
00:16:26,461 --> 00:16:27,960
she doesn't have 12 hours.

425
00:16:27,962 --> 00:16:30,063
Kid's dying, and they're stonewalling.

426
00:16:30,065 --> 00:16:31,497
Bastards won't budge.

427
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:33,599
What about a court order?

428
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:35,368
24 hours, at least.

429
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,930
How hard did you push them, Cabe?

430
00:16:38,338 --> 00:16:40,773
You know me.

431
00:16:40,775 --> 00:16:43,142
I tried as hard as I could.

432
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:47,547
I've been trying to hack Vlaxco's records,

433
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,115
but all confidential drug trials

434
00:16:49,117 --> 00:16:51,183
are kept on an air-gapped system.

435
00:16:51,185 --> 00:16:53,085
That means not connected to the Web.

436
00:16:53,087 --> 00:16:54,453
We can't get it.

437
00:16:54,455 --> 00:16:57,390
If I had another coffee cup in
my hand right now, I'd smash it.

438
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:58,758
I don't think I'd blame you.

439
00:17:05,832 --> 00:17:06,632
Cabe.

440
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:08,567
Hmm. Call the governor.

441
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,604
Ask if Vlaxco keeps hard
copies of the study files.

442
00:17:11,606 --> 00:17:13,072
Why am I asking?

443
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,573
We're gonna break in.

444
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:27,369
I understand that we need
to get all the patients

445
00:17:27,395 --> 00:17:28,728
for the Vlaxco drug trial.

446
00:17:28,754 --> 00:17:31,388
I get that that is where
we're going to find the person

447
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,989
who keeps making these kids sick.

448
00:17:32,991 --> 00:17:37,093
But I think<i> I</i> would be better
suited for an advisory role.

449
00:17:37,095 --> 00:17:38,762
Sylvester, if Cabe gets caught,

450
00:17:38,764 --> 00:17:40,363
it's federal time. If Paige gets caught,

451
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:43,466
she loses Ralph.
Happy and Toby are the distraction.

452
00:17:45,002 --> 00:17:46,603
<i>I</i> could be the distraction.

453
00:17:46,605 --> 00:17:48,571
N-N-No, you need to memorize the files.
No one else can do that.

454
00:17:48,573 --> 00:17:50,407
It's over a hundred pages long.

455
00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:51,708
I'm gonna be reading the layout

456
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,276
and guiding you through the building, okay?

457
00:17:53,278 --> 00:17:54,577
Okay.

458
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:56,312
I'm still not clear on what this has to do

459
00:17:56,314 --> 00:17:58,148
with Earl's Sub Shop across the street.

460
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,750
Well, Vlaxco has a brutal security firewall

461
00:18:00,752 --> 00:18:03,052
that would take hours to hack.

462
00:18:03,054 --> 00:18:05,221
But they also have hundreds of employees.
So, statistically,

463
00:18:05,223 --> 00:18:07,757
one of them is gonna
order from Earl's today.

464
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:09,425
Now, I've hacked into the sub shop's server

465
00:18:09,427 --> 00:18:13,663
and I've placed a Trojan
shell on their PDF menu.

466
00:18:13,665 --> 00:18:17,333
Your Trojan horse is a
two-for-one sub coupon.

467
00:18:17,335 --> 00:18:19,636
That's a really good deal.

468
00:18:19,638 --> 00:18:22,272
Earl knows his way around a hoagie.

469
00:18:22,274 --> 00:18:24,807
Now, as soon as someone
clicks on the PDF menu

470
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:26,175
and downloads the coupon,

471
00:18:26,177 --> 00:18:28,378
we're past the Vlaxco firewall.

472
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,940
It's lunchtime, so it shouldn't take long.

473
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,084
I'm in.

474
00:18:35,086 --> 00:18:37,987
All right, just going through HR.

475
00:18:37,989 --> 00:18:41,591
Just looking through the
employee security badges.

476
00:18:41,593 --> 00:18:42,692
I'll be damned.

477
00:18:42,694 --> 00:18:44,494
All right, look for someone
in middle management.

478
00:18:44,496 --> 00:18:47,263
A guy driving a low-level luxury sedan,

479
00:18:47,265 --> 00:18:48,798
trying to keep up with the VPs.

480
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,199
That's someone that can really get angry.

481
00:18:50,201 --> 00:18:51,167
- Mmm. 
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

482
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:52,969
Jed Hausler.

483
00:18:52,971 --> 00:18:54,437
Just copying his data.

484
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:57,773
Should have a bogus security
badge in a few seconds.

485
00:18:57,775 --> 00:18:59,909
I'm heading over to Happy.

486
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:00,910
Good luck, Sly.

487
00:19:00,912 --> 00:19:02,378
Governor.

488
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,380
We may have some good news
for you here in a while.

489
00:19:04,382 --> 00:19:07,083
It's an involved operation,

490
00:19:07,085 --> 00:19:10,019
I'll run it down for you later.

491
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:12,555
My thoughts and prayers are with you,
Governor.

492
00:19:12,557 --> 00:19:13,659
How is she?

493
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,605
She's holding on as best she can.

494
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,161
Walter lied to me earlier about his sister.

495
00:19:19,163 --> 00:19:21,664
Said she'd gotten over a childhood illness,

496
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,599
but I saw a letter that said

497
00:19:23,601 --> 00:19:26,068
she's in a care facility battling MS.

498
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,871
He doesn't talk about her much.

499
00:19:28,873 --> 00:19:30,539
I know, but when he's reminded of her,

500
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,174
he smashes things and tackles people

501
00:19:32,176 --> 00:19:33,442
and does daytime robberies.

502
00:19:33,444 --> 00:19:37,012
I'm just trying to give
him as much space as I can.

503
00:19:42,052 --> 00:19:43,685
Third message.

504
00:19:43,687 --> 00:19:46,288
Just want to reiterate,
I am making real money now.

505
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,257
Can start to re-pay you.

506
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:49,625
Even if you're seeing someone.

507
00:19:49,627 --> 00:19:50,726
It's totally immaterial.

508
00:19:52,696 --> 00:19:55,063
You can call me back anytime.

509
00:20:02,672 --> 00:20:05,273
She's not getting back with you.

510
00:20:05,275 --> 00:20:07,743
Look, people only let you down.

511
00:20:07,745 --> 00:20:09,778
Sooner you realize that, the better.

512
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,313
That's a cynical worldview.

513
00:20:11,315 --> 00:20:13,582
When I was two,
my dad took me to St. Luke's,

514
00:20:13,584 --> 00:20:16,485
handed me to a nurse and said,
“Find her a good home. ”

515
00:20:16,487 --> 00:20:18,120
Thanks to how my brain works,

516
00:20:18,122 --> 00:20:19,721
I remember every moment of it.

517
00:20:19,723 --> 00:20:22,724
So 25 years later, I'm not cynical...

518
00:20:22,726 --> 00:20:23,992
I'm smart.

519
00:20:23,994 --> 00:20:25,660
You put a quarter-inch wrench

520
00:20:25,662 --> 00:20:27,262
on a quarter-inch bolt, it works.

521
00:20:27,264 --> 00:20:29,664
Tools don't let you down. Only people do.

522
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:32,500
Spending your life scared
to connect to anyone

523
00:20:32,502 --> 00:20:33,835
isn't any way to live.

524
00:20:37,373 --> 00:20:40,442
Software just picked up Jed
Hausler's license plate.

525
00:20:40,444 --> 00:20:41,509
Let's go find his car.

526
00:20:41,511 --> 00:20:41,776
Here's your earpiece.

527
00:20:41,778 --> 00:20:42,744
- Arpiece. 
- Let's go find his car.

528
00:20:42,746 --> 00:20:45,231
The laboratories have
disease samples, Walter.

529
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:46,857
Like the plague.

530
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:48,959
They have the actual plague.

531
00:20:48,961 --> 00:20:50,856
Sylvester, you're not going
near the biohazard lab.

532
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,758
I'm gonna be talking you
through the whole way.

533
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:53,986
Okay, you guys ready?

534
00:20:54,012 --> 00:20:57,612
Looking for Jed Hausler's car.

535
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:00,826
There! Punch it, sister!

536
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,435
Excuse me.

537
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:12,404
My wife is the world's worst driver.

538
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,410
Could you find out who owns this car?

539
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:18,743
You can do this.

540
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:20,523
You just walk in,

541
00:21:20,525 --> 00:21:22,058
look at the files,

542
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,027
you walk out.

543
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:26,829
Walk in, look, walk out.

544
00:21:28,499 --> 00:21:30,433
That's our guy. Sylvester...

545
00:21:30,435 --> 00:21:31,601
you're on.

546
00:21:31,603 --> 00:21:33,844
You need to get out of
there before he comes back

547
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,031
and swipes his real ID.

548
00:21:35,057 --> 00:21:36,457
Okay.

549
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,216
Oh...

550
00:21:47,218 --> 00:21:48,484
He looks angry. Perfect.

551
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,680
What the hell did you do to my car?

552
00:21:50,721 --> 00:21:51,621
Not me. Him.

553
00:21:51,623 --> 00:21:53,189
Who was driving?

554
00:21:53,191 --> 00:21:54,423
You distracted me.

555
00:21:54,425 --> 00:21:56,058
Oh, talking is a distraction?

556
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,460
Constant complaining is distraction.

557
00:21:57,694 --> 00:21:58,761
Hey!

558
00:21:58,763 --> 00:22:01,323
Can we please talk about
the damage to my car?

559
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:02,031
My bad.

560
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:03,065
Love the 'stache.

561
00:22:03,067 --> 00:22:05,468
Um... $300, we'll call it a day?

562
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,536
There's thousands in damage here.

563
00:22:07,538 --> 00:22:09,071
$350.

564
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,700
Just give me your insurance papers.

565
00:22:16,346 --> 00:22:18,881
Hey, you recently divorced?

566
00:22:18,883 --> 00:22:20,923
There's a tan line where
your wedding ring would be.

567
00:22:20,984 --> 00:22:22,418
I only ask

568
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:26,455
'cause... I think I'm about
to pull that trigger myself.

569
00:22:29,693 --> 00:22:31,126
All right.

570
00:22:31,128 --> 00:22:33,228
You're looking for 2008, January to August.

571
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,297
Trexicane trial program.

572
00:22:36,566 --> 00:22:38,333
Okay. I got the box.

573
00:22:38,335 --> 00:22:41,403
Okay, get the name of 
every patient in the trial.

574
00:22:51,881 --> 00:22:53,615
How long is that going to take?

575
00:22:54,117 --> 00:22:54,850
Accuracy is bliss.

576
00:22:54,852 --> 00:22:56,184
Do you see this?

577
00:22:56,186 --> 00:22:58,420
Cold as Pennsylvania steel.

578
00:22:58,422 --> 00:23:00,462
Maybe if you knew how to warm me up...

579
00:23:00,857 --> 00:23:01,723
That's my supervisor,

580
00:23:01,725 --> 00:23:03,191
who's going to kick my ass.

581
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:04,811
Hold on. He can wait.

582
00:23:04,837 --> 00:23:06,519
You're the guy just a step ahead of me:

583
00:23:06,545 --> 00:23:08,338
you're back in the single scene,

584
00:23:08,364 --> 00:23:09,297
trading boxers for briefs,

585
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:11,266
hitting the gym, scoring hair plugs...

586
00:23:11,268 --> 00:23:14,317
Get the hell out of my way and
leave your info at the desk.

587
00:23:17,507 --> 00:23:18,874
Not good.

588
00:23:18,876 --> 00:23:20,996
Yeah, we couldn't hold our patsy any longer.

589
00:23:21,128 --> 00:23:23,448
- He's heading back in. 
- There he is.

590
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:32,087
Mr. Hausler,
it's saying you're already in here.

591
00:23:32,089 --> 00:23:33,788
Well, clearly, I'm not.

592
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:37,452
I don't want you to panic,
but the guards know

593
00:23:37,478 --> 00:23:38,668
you're in the building.

594
00:23:38,694 --> 00:23:39,327
Oh, boy...

595
00:23:39,329 --> 00:23:41,129
Okay...

596
00:23:43,699 --> 00:23:45,633
Security's been alerted.

597
00:23:45,635 --> 00:23:47,075
They are coming toward the file room.

598
00:23:47,303 --> 00:23:48,436
Okay. All done.

599
00:23:48,438 --> 00:23:51,114
Now,
you can get out through the doors

600
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,900
in the back. To your left.

601
00:23:55,244 --> 00:23:57,045
Walter, you said no biohazard.

602
00:23:57,047 --> 00:23:58,179
You have to.

603
00:23:58,181 --> 00:23:59,781
Anthrax!

604
00:23:59,783 --> 00:24:01,816
Last year the CDC exposed 86

605
00:24:01,818 --> 00:24:03,818
of their own people to anthrax.

606
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,900
Walter, there could be anthrax back there.

607
00:24:05,926 --> 00:24:07,497
Listen to me, you have no other way out.

608
00:24:07,523 --> 00:24:08,521
Walter, there's got to be...

609
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,238
Walter!

610
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,519
We see you on the security cam.

611
00:24:20,545 --> 00:24:22,255
I am in a dirty room, Walter.

612
00:24:22,281 --> 00:24:25,046
Just stay calm. Head out the 
east side door. Do you see it?

613
00:24:25,072 --> 00:24:26,072
Yes.

614
00:24:26,074 --> 00:24:27,766
Now, there's a service hall

615
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:29,633
on the other side. Head down there

616
00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:31,379
to the exit, where we'll be waiting for you.

617
00:24:32,045 --> 00:24:33,245
Sylvester, pick up the pace, pal.

618
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:35,981
I don't know if you can push
him too hard here, Walter.

619
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:38,522
This is my worst nightmare. Literally.

620
00:24:38,661 --> 00:24:40,861
I have had this one.

621
00:24:40,887 --> 00:24:42,421
Oh...

622
00:24:42,423 --> 00:24:44,623
Guards are getting closer, Sylvester.

623
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:46,091
I can't touch that handle.

624
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:47,479
Logically, it's probably

625
00:24:47,505 --> 00:24:49,303
one of the cleanest handles in the world.

626
00:24:49,329 --> 00:24:50,506
Much better than a public bathroom.

627
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:52,373
- I don't touch those either!
- Open the damn door,

628
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:53,764
because if you think this lab's dirty,

629
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,894
wait until you're in a prison cell,

630
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,111
which is where they will take you
if you don't open the door.

631
00:24:57,137 --> 00:24:58,537
No.

632
00:24:58,539 --> 00:24:59,705
Come on, Sylvester.

633
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:01,548
Get the hell out of there, now.

634
00:25:01,574 --> 00:25:02,983
You cannot be impatient with him.
Sylvester...

635
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:03,709
it's Paige.

636
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,217
What if you take off your sweater

637
00:25:05,243 --> 00:25:06,687
and put it around your hand?

638
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,816
What kind of deterrent against a
lethal spore is a poly-cotton blend?

639
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:10,963
Think of something else.

640
00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:12,593
Um... so you got a paycheck today.

641
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:13,660
What are you going to do with your money?

642
00:25:13,686 --> 00:25:14,886
Get rid of it. Money makes me nervous.

643
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,863
Okay, then close your 
eyes and get rid of it.

644
00:25:16,889 --> 00:25:17,956
Okay.

645
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:19,878
You need to hand over the money...

646
00:25:20,293 --> 00:25:20,826
All right. Oh...

647
00:25:20,828 --> 00:25:21,927
Pull down...

648
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:24,129
and run like hell!

649
00:25:31,678 --> 00:25:33,529
Come on! Come on!

650
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:53,525
Her fever's worse.

651
00:25:53,527 --> 00:25:54,859
She's in decline.

652
00:25:54,861 --> 00:25:57,095
Where are we, folks?

653
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,464
Well, based on the names Sylvester got us,

654
00:25:59,466 --> 00:26:02,333
we're pulling background on the
people from the Vlaxco trial.

655
00:26:02,335 --> 00:26:04,002
Now we can look for our suspect.

656
00:26:04,804 --> 00:26:06,724
The last participant in the trial.

657
00:26:07,973 --> 00:26:10,108
So, we have 50 names here.

658
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,809
One of them is our biohacker.

659
00:26:12,478 --> 00:26:13,811
How do we narrow it down?

660
00:26:13,813 --> 00:26:15,979
Our bad guy's gotten kids sick

661
00:26:16,005 --> 00:26:18,091
and made sure the parents knew
it was done intentionally.

662
00:26:18,117 --> 00:26:19,044
That's a real angry dude.

663
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,393
Take it from someone who has dropped

664
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:21,619
a fortune at games of chance:

665
00:26:21,671 --> 00:26:24,026
nothing makes the psyche
more vindictive than loss.

666
00:26:24,052 --> 00:26:25,084
It's primal;

667
00:26:25,086 --> 00:26:26,752
through vengeance, humans wrongly believe

668
00:26:26,754 --> 00:26:27,987
they can be made whole again.

669
00:26:28,013 --> 00:26:29,555
We need to find whoever

670
00:26:29,557 --> 00:26:31,163
lost the most from this
drug not being approved.

671
00:26:31,203 --> 00:26:34,092
So, 20 test subjects showed
no improvement from the drugs.

672
00:26:34,118 --> 00:26:35,514
So they didn't really lose anything

673
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,615
from being part of the trial.

674
00:26:36,641 --> 00:26:37,971
They entered sick, they left sick.

675
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:40,404
- We're down to 30.
- Same with those who got the placebo...

676
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,278
their situation didn't change.

677
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,713
They might have been disappointed

678
00:26:42,739 --> 00:26:44,827
they didn't get the real drug,
but that's not loss.

679
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,295
Five died since the trial ended.

680
00:26:46,321 --> 00:26:47,251
They're all out.

681
00:26:47,253 --> 00:26:49,027
Okay, here's where we get down

682
00:26:49,053 --> 00:26:50,053
to the nitty-gritty.

683
00:26:50,055 --> 00:26:52,089
The guys left have all suffered loss.

684
00:26:52,115 --> 00:26:54,316
All would have improved
with the Trexicane drug.

685
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,537
Benjamin Carlisle, maybe?

686
00:26:59,563 --> 00:27:00,929
32 years old,

687
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:02,676
entrepreneur making six figures.

688
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:03,945
When he started the study,

689
00:27:03,968 --> 00:27:05,401
he was engaged... world on a string.

690
00:27:05,427 --> 00:27:06,702
Where's he now?

691
00:27:06,704 --> 00:27:08,637
Begging for charity for his treatment,

692
00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:10,305
blogging pretty angrily

693
00:27:10,307 --> 00:27:13,642
regarding his degenerating condition...

694
00:27:13,644 --> 00:27:15,310
and no longer engaged.

695
00:27:15,312 --> 00:27:18,447
If I lost a fiancée to a disease

696
00:27:18,449 --> 00:27:20,616
that could have been cured,
I'd consider revenge.

697
00:27:20,642 --> 00:27:22,517
That's not the guy.

698
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:24,086
This is.

699
00:27:24,088 --> 00:27:25,220
Robert Richter.

700
00:27:25,222 --> 00:27:26,755
Single dad.

701
00:27:26,757 --> 00:27:27,990
According to this, his child

702
00:27:28,016 --> 00:27:29,176
responded well to the meds

703
00:27:29,202 --> 00:27:31,282
but died after the drug trial was scrapped.

704
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:34,429
He lost more than anyone.

705
00:27:35,665 --> 00:27:37,699
You're basing this purely on emotion.

706
00:27:37,701 --> 00:27:39,868
There's entire sections of jurisprudence

707
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,436
based on crimes of passion.

708
00:27:41,438 --> 00:27:45,006
Emotion is as good as any of them.

709
00:27:45,008 --> 00:27:47,375
Especially in a case like this.

710
00:27:47,377 --> 00:27:49,111
Trust me.

711
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:51,847
Guys? There's a Robert Richter

712
00:27:51,849 --> 00:27:55,283
that works at Venice College of Science.

713
00:27:55,285 --> 00:27:58,353
And he is a microbiology professor.

714
00:28:05,461 --> 00:28:09,301
There should be some
evidence here in Richter's office.

715
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:12,067
I'm sorry, Mr. Richter

716
00:28:12,069 --> 00:28:13,501
is gone for the day.

717
00:28:13,527 --> 00:28:16,271
Um, maybe I should call 
campus security first?

718
00:28:16,338 --> 00:28:17,939
Feel free, but my badge is bigger.

719
00:28:17,941 --> 00:28:20,642
We'll take it from here.

720
00:28:20,644 --> 00:28:22,279
All I have in here are exam papers.

721
00:28:22,305 --> 00:28:23,511
Same here.

722
00:28:23,513 --> 00:28:26,073
Oh, oh, oh. Look what I found.

723
00:28:27,616 --> 00:28:30,118
He was computer modeling spray patterns.

724
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,420
I bet he loads

725
00:28:32,422 --> 00:28:34,068
a small aerosol device with the virus;

726
00:28:34,094 --> 00:28:35,694
all he's got to do is get a few feet

727
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,234
from the victim, presses a button

728
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,793
and then he infects them with a gene

729
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:40,351
that'll kill only them.

730
00:28:41,163 --> 00:28:42,697
Target never even knows.

731
00:28:42,699 --> 00:28:44,499
That's a pretty sophisticated murder weapon.

732
00:28:44,501 --> 00:28:45,767
And scary easy to make.

733
00:28:45,944 --> 00:28:47,695
He's got fast DNA sequencers,

734
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:50,071
graphene-based nanochannel hardware...

735
00:28:50,073 --> 00:28:52,340
Today, genetic engineering is a hobby;

736
00:28:52,342 --> 00:28:53,574
if you're smart enough,

737
00:28:53,576 --> 00:28:55,743
you can be a modern Typhoid Mary.

738
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:05,620
Uh... what are you doing?

739
00:29:05,622 --> 00:29:07,455
Happy was right.

740
00:29:07,457 --> 00:29:12,927
Richter is a modern Typhoid Mary,
emphasis on modern.

741
00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:15,997
His daughter died in 2010.

742
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:18,966
The reason he had to wait
years to retaliate is he had

743
00:29:18,992 --> 00:29:20,313
to wait for technology to catch up

744
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:22,259
to his plans. But now that it has,

745
00:29:22,285 --> 00:29:25,081
the same technology might
be the thing that stops him.

746
00:29:25,107 --> 00:29:25,639
Here.

747
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:26,974
Saved in the memory

748
00:29:26,976 --> 00:29:29,076
are the sequences for the killer genes.

749
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:31,618
And how does that help us?

750
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,314
We send this to CDC,

751
00:29:33,316 --> 00:29:35,876
they can follow the blueprint backwards

752
00:29:36,017 --> 00:29:37,751
to reverse-engineer what
Richter did in two hours.

753
00:29:37,753 --> 00:29:39,787
They can save the people he infected.

754
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:41,592
They can make an antidote.

755
00:29:42,825 --> 00:29:44,392
Before I send this...

756
00:29:44,418 --> 00:29:45,484
I'm positive.

757
00:29:45,837 --> 00:29:47,837
Great work.

758
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,366
Well, considering we just saved four kids,

759
00:29:52,368 --> 00:29:54,433
maybe we earned a celebratory toast.

760
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,826
Sylvester?

761
00:29:55,852 --> 00:29:58,013
Uh, you really think I'm
gonna drink something

762
00:29:58,039 --> 00:29:59,199
out of a bio lab's fridge?

763
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:03,577
Well... yeah.

764
00:30:03,579 --> 00:30:05,045
Don't celebrate just yet.

765
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,048
There's another sequence here.

766
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:10,050
There's a fifth target.

767
00:30:10,052 --> 00:30:11,752
- Fifth target?
Mm-hmm.

768
00:30:11,754 --> 00:30:14,655
That spam creep said he only
sent four e-mail viruses.

769
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:16,581
Well, maybe this guy didn't get an e-mail

770
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:18,201
'cause he's special to Richter.

771
00:30:18,227 --> 00:30:20,527
Special how?

772
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:22,396
This sequence also appears

773
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:25,432
in a file in Richter's
laptop referring to...

774
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:33,373
It's the governor.

775
00:30:35,977 --> 00:30:37,897
So, the last one is Governor Lane.

776
00:30:37,923 --> 00:30:39,412
But the sequence is
different from the others.

777
00:30:39,414 --> 00:30:41,948
The sequence targets a potassium channel

778
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,551
in the heart, killing the person instantly.

779
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,690
He's not at his house.

780
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:52,081
His wife said he ditched security,

781
00:30:52,107 --> 00:30:54,162
went out the back.
They don't know where he went.

782
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:56,638
The only thing that can keep a
man away from his dying child

783
00:30:56,664 --> 00:30:58,184
is if he thinks he can make her better.

784
00:30:58,232 --> 00:30:59,466
Richter called him.

785
00:30:59,468 --> 00:31:01,367
Promised him an antidote

786
00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:04,237
if the governor would meet
with him and just hear him out.

787
00:31:05,272 --> 00:31:07,273
He's not gonna give the
governor an antidote.

788
00:31:07,275 --> 00:31:08,608
He's gonna give him the virus.

789
00:31:08,849 --> 00:31:10,249
It's not just gonna make him suffer.

790
00:31:11,312 --> 00:31:12,846
It's gonna stop the governor's heart

791
00:31:12,848 --> 00:31:14,447
within seconds.

792
00:31:23,941 --> 00:31:27,039
I put an alarm on the governor's family car.

793
00:31:27,931 --> 00:31:29,597
Why the hell isn't he
answering his cell phone?

794
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:32,166
It's not on and even if it were,
he wouldn't answer.

795
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:33,401
Checking GPS.

796
00:31:33,403 --> 00:31:35,870
We'll track him soon.

797
00:31:35,872 --> 00:31:38,114
- Toby, what about Richter?
- I'm getting a bead

798
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:38,910
on his phone, too.

799
00:31:38,936 --> 00:31:40,539
I got Richter's cell records.

800
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,195
Last call was to Governor Lane,
15 minutes ago.

801
00:31:43,221 --> 00:31:45,222
I warned the governor 
about irrational behavior.

802
00:31:45,248 --> 00:31:47,292
I told him not to do anything stupid.

803
00:31:47,983 --> 00:31:49,743
Got him! Got the governor.

804
00:31:50,485 --> 00:31:51,752
- He's at Marina Beach Plaza.
- Really?

805
00:31:51,754 --> 00:31:53,995
Well, then we got a problem,
'cause so is Richter.

806
00:32:02,564 --> 00:32:04,832
Spread out! We need to find the governor!

807
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:15,943
I got nothing up here!

808
00:32:16,678 --> 00:32:19,179
Ditto that in the...

809
00:32:19,181 --> 00:32:20,981
rotunda.

810
00:32:20,983 --> 00:32:22,249
Lower level's clear.

811
00:32:22,617 --> 00:32:23,417
Okay, okay.

812
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:24,836
Think about how this would go down.

813
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:27,964
He sees the police and knows it's
got to happen fast but private.

814
00:32:32,827 --> 00:32:34,027
Toby, anything?

815
00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:35,229
He wouldn't wait in the open.

816
00:32:35,255 --> 00:32:36,376
Not with all the police.

817
00:32:36,402 --> 00:32:38,373
Someplace in here, but someplace quiet.

818
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:39,963
Side hallways maybe.

819
00:32:43,971 --> 00:32:45,105
I found Richter!

820
00:32:45,107 --> 00:32:47,541
We're on our way.

821
00:32:53,714 --> 00:32:55,081
He's moving towards the target.

822
00:32:55,136 --> 00:32:56,727
I got eyes on him!

823
00:32:59,086 --> 00:33:01,421
Cabe, if he even gets close,
Governor Lane is dead!

824
00:33:02,156 --> 00:33:04,157
Homeland Security! Don't move!

825
00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:10,163
He expelled the virus!

826
00:33:10,165 --> 00:33:12,085
- It'll be aerosolized in...
- Ten seconds!

827
00:33:12,196 --> 00:33:13,905
Based on where the governor is standing,

828
00:33:13,931 --> 00:33:14,810
the interior wind patterns

829
00:33:14,836 --> 00:33:16,836
and s-scattergrams!

830
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:18,539
Now, you have seven seconds.

831
00:33:19,212 --> 00:33:20,993
- What are you doing?
- Making it rain.

832
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:23,271
- What? 
- To take down the virus.

833
00:33:23,556 --> 00:33:25,171
Two seconds, Walter!

834
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:40,627
How do we know this worked?

835
00:33:40,629 --> 00:33:43,296
Well, if it didn't, he'd be dead by now.

836
00:33:52,272 --> 00:33:55,341
- He said he had an antidote! 
- No, sir.

837
00:33:55,343 --> 00:33:57,677
We already sent the
antidote for your daughter.

838
00:33:57,703 --> 00:33:59,297
He was trying to kill you.

839
00:34:02,683 --> 00:34:04,450
Agent Gallo,

840
00:34:04,452 --> 00:34:05,851
she's gonna be fine.

841
00:34:05,853 --> 00:34:07,620
So glad to hear it, Governor.

842
00:34:07,622 --> 00:34:09,121
I'll tell my team.

843
00:34:12,893 --> 00:34:16,696
The antidote the CDC synthesized is working.

844
00:34:16,698 --> 00:34:19,332
Helena's fever broke.

845
00:34:19,334 --> 00:34:22,009
We're getting reports of the
same from the other victims.

846
00:34:24,704 --> 00:34:26,939
You think I care... getting caught?

847
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:28,908
Dying in prison?

848
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:31,110
I died when my daughter did.

849
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:32,545
I just didn't feel

850
00:34:32,547 --> 00:34:34,246
that I should be the only one

851
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:35,823
to feel the pain I experienced.

852
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:37,383
You're not.

853
00:34:37,385 --> 00:34:39,485
I know what it feels like to sit

854
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:41,712
at your child's bedside.

855
00:34:42,256 --> 00:34:45,791
Watching each breath they take,
praying it won't be their last.

856
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:48,961
To hold your daughter's hand,

857
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:52,498
trying to memorize what it feels like

858
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,200
so you won't forget.

859
00:34:57,537 --> 00:35:00,272
Your daughter

860
00:35:00,274 --> 00:35:02,141
too scared to close her eyes,

861
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:05,077
even when she's so tired,
because she's worried

862
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:07,379
she won't be able to open them again.

863
00:35:08,081 --> 00:35:11,049
Some things you just can't fix.

864
00:35:11,051 --> 00:35:14,152
You got to live with them.

865
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,456
You don't take innocent lives.

866
00:35:18,691 --> 00:35:20,859
We shouldn't be listening to this.

867
00:35:25,598 --> 00:35:27,432
That man deserved to die.

868
00:35:27,434 --> 00:35:31,069
They all deserved to feel my pain!

869
00:35:31,071 --> 00:35:34,539
No, they didn't.

870
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:36,741
No one deserves it.

871
00:35:39,582 --> 00:35:42,117
Hey, I'm going to get Ralph.

872
00:35:42,143 --> 00:35:43,876
I got him a new telescope.

873
00:35:43,878 --> 00:35:46,478
And I thought we might set
it up on the roof and grill.

874
00:35:46,504 --> 00:35:47,679
Want to join us?

875
00:35:47,681 --> 00:35:49,915
Uh, maybe later, but thanks.

876
00:35:49,917 --> 00:35:51,550
Okay.

877
00:35:51,552 --> 00:35:54,286
Isn't that called "trying to unring a bell"?

878
00:35:55,777 --> 00:35:58,860
Sometimes it's okay to admit
you don't have all the answers.

879
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:02,361
You know about my sister, don't you?

880
00:36:02,363 --> 00:36:04,329
How she's still sick?

881
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:06,265
It's not really my business.

882
00:36:06,267 --> 00:36:09,768
I was just trying to help you today.

883
00:36:11,537 --> 00:36:13,868
For me, my mind...

884
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:17,676
every problem has a solution.

885
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:22,647
There must be a solution for her.

886
00:36:27,627 --> 00:36:29,027
Hey.

887
00:36:31,657 --> 00:36:34,013
I should never have yelled at you earlier.

888
00:36:35,162 --> 00:36:37,195
You're the bravest person I've ever met.

889
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,406
That girl would've died today without you.

890
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:43,935
Without us.

891
00:36:46,613 --> 00:36:51,576
Federal transpo just came
around back and picked up Richter.

892
00:36:51,578 --> 00:36:52,717
I'm on my way out.

893
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:55,357
Ralph and I were gonna barbecue
some burgers up on the roof.

894
00:36:55,383 --> 00:36:56,863
It would really help if you could keep

895
00:36:56,889 --> 00:36:58,901
an eye on him while I work the grill.

896
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,298
<i>Can I help you?</i>

897
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,799
Yes, uh, this is for the kids.

898
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:18,236
But nothing for the biology department.

899
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:21,406
Or a-a lab of any kind.

900
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:23,608
Something fun?

901
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:28,479
And safe.

902
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:55,132
<i>- Hi. This is</i> <i>Dr. Tobias M. Curtis.</i>
<i>- Please leave a message.</i>

903
00:37:55,158 --> 00:37:57,029
<i>Hi, Toby. It's me.</i>

904
00:37:57,055 --> 00:37:59,590
<i>I'm really glad things
are going well for you.</i>

905
00:37:59,616 --> 00:38:02,327
<i>But I don't care</i> <i>about the money you owe.</i>

906
00:38:02,353 --> 00:38:04,254
<i>I moved on.</i>

907
00:38:04,256 --> 00:38:05,855
<i>Please do the same.</i>

908
00:38:05,857 --> 00:38:08,832
<i>And don't call again. Bye.</i>

909
00:38:08,858 --> 00:38:10,363
All in.

910
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:12,056
You didn't even see your cards yet.

911
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:12,815
I don't have to.

912
00:38:13,565 --> 00:38:16,432
I see you.

913
00:38:25,175 --> 00:38:26,275
Hey.

914
00:38:26,277 --> 00:38:28,744
Hi, Walter.

915
00:38:31,336 --> 00:38:33,951
Your sister is the best patient we have.

916
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,614
Never quits.

917
00:38:37,827 --> 00:38:39,312
I got my first paycheck.

918
00:38:39,381 --> 00:38:41,348
Well, I hope you're gonna do something fun.

919
00:38:41,374 --> 00:38:42,241
You deserve it.

920
00:38:42,651 --> 00:38:44,918
Yeah, I'm gonna do something for you.

921
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,119
Hey.

922
00:38:47,588 --> 00:38:51,224
MS is my fight, not yours.

923
00:38:51,226 --> 00:38:53,359
I'm not gonna let you die, Megan.

924
00:38:53,361 --> 00:38:55,795
I'm going to fix you.

925
00:38:59,033 --> 00:39:01,868
Cabe, another medium-well?

926
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,036
"Another"?

927
00:39:03,038 --> 00:39:04,437
The last one was raw.

928
00:39:06,106 --> 00:39:07,307
Hi, Walter.

929
00:39:07,309 --> 00:39:09,876
Ralph.

930
00:39:09,878 --> 00:39:11,945
There, I think I'm done, Ralph.

931
00:39:11,947 --> 00:39:13,746
Come check this out.

932
00:39:18,018 --> 00:39:19,452
See all the stars?

933
00:39:19,454 --> 00:39:22,488
There's millions of them up there.

934
00:39:25,826 --> 00:39:27,427
You got a notepad?

935
00:39:32,966 --> 00:39:34,567
Thank you.

936
00:39:42,075 --> 00:39:45,578
You know, having a family
can be a hard thing.

937
00:39:47,447 --> 00:39:50,282
Makes you vulnerable.

938
00:39:50,284 --> 00:39:52,451
I know.

939
00:39:57,891 --> 00:40:00,025
It can be a good thing, too.

940
00:40:02,729 --> 00:40:04,330
I know.

941
00:40:07,734 --> 00:40:10,936
Hey. Hey.

942
00:40:18,879 --> 00:40:21,180
Hey, Ralph? If you look at the curvature

943
00:40:21,206 --> 00:40:24,434
of the moon's surface, Orion's belt makes

944
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,094
a perfect horizontal tangent line.

945
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,554
- Isn't that cool?
- It is cool!

946
00:40:29,924 --> 00:40:31,323
Thank you.

947
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:34,429
No problem.

YOU DESERVE IT.

954
00:41:50,035 --> 00:41:53,156
When was the last time your wireless
company made you feel like this?

955
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,610
The new Cricket Wireless believes you
should be doing a lot more of this.

956
00:41:59,445 --> 00:42:02,347
So we don't have any of
those silly annual contracts.

957
00:42:03,015 --> 00:42:04,882
But we do have a whole lot of coverage...

958
00:42:04,917 --> 00:42:06,084
..for not a lot of money.

959
00:42:06,618 --> 00:42:08,653
So everyone can feel like this.

The new Cricket Wireless.

964
00:42:17,563 --> 00:42:18,763
Something to smile about.

965
00:42:19,064 --> 00:42:21,632
MUSICAL CHAIRS. FUN, RIGHT?

966
00:42:21,634 --> 00:42:23,401
WELLLLLLLLL,
NOT WHEN YOUR TRAVEL REWARDS CARD

967
00:42:23,403 --> 00:42:25,870
MAKES IT SO HARD TO GET
A SEAT USING YOUR MILES.

968
00:42:25,872 --> 00:42:27,104
THAT'S THEIR GAME.

969
00:42:27,106 --> 00:42:28,839
THE FLIGHTS YOU WANT ARE BLACKED OUT.

970
00:42:28,841 --> 00:42:31,609
OR THEY ASK FOR SOME
RIDICULOUS NUMBER OF MILES.

971
00:42:31,611 --> 00:42:33,544
HONESTLY, IT'S TIME TO SWITCH

972
00:42:33,546 --> 00:42:35,112
TO THE VENTURE CARD FROM CAPITAL ONE.

973
00:42:35,114 --> 00:42:37,581
WITH VENTURE, USE YOUR MILES ON ANY AIRLINE,

974
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:38,983
ANY FLIGHT, ANY TIME.

975
00:42:38,985 --> 00:42:40,451
NO BLACKOUT DATES.

976
00:42:40,453 --> 00:42:43,454
AND WITH EVERY PURCHASE,
YOU'LL EARN UNLIMITED DOUBLE MILES.

977
00:42:43,456 --> 00:42:46,690
FROM NOW ON, NO ONE'S TAKING YOUR SEAT AWAY.

978
00:42:46,692 --> 00:42:48,559
WHAT'S IN YOUR WALLET?
