1
00:00:04,386 --> 00:00:06,058
<i>My name is Walter O'Brien.</i>

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,441
<i>I have the fourth highest IQ</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

3
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:12,210
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

4
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:14,820
<i>When I was 11, the FBI</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking NASA</i>

5
00:00:14,822 --> 00:00:17,524
<i>to get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

6
00:00:17,526 --> 00:00:19,597
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

7
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:22,669
<i>tackling worldwide threats</i>
<i>only we can solve.</i>

8
00:00:22,671 --> 00:00:24,438
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,211
<i>Sylvester's a human calculator.</i>

10
00:00:26,213 --> 00:00:28,516
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

11
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:30,813
<i>Agent Cabe Gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

12
00:00:30,815 --> 00:00:32,981
<i>And Paige?</i>
<i>Well, Paige isn't like us.</i>

13
00:00:32,983 --> 00:00:35,558
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

14
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,127
<i>while we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

15
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:39,831
<i>Together, we are Scorpion.</i>

16
00:00:51,408 --> 00:00:53,271
Think we should go east.

17
00:00:53,273 --> 00:00:55,209
That's west.

18
00:00:55,211 --> 00:00:57,480
Well, still should go that way.

19
00:00:57,482 --> 00:00:59,752
Yeah?
Based on what?

20
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:02,751
This is your fault!

21
00:01:02,753 --> 00:01:04,286
You had to take us
off the trail.

22
00:01:04,288 --> 00:01:05,686
You had to see
that damn waterfall!

23
00:01:05,688 --> 00:01:06,886
I thought I knew
where I was going.

24
00:01:06,888 --> 00:01:09,191
Oh, well, a lot of good
that does us now, huh?

25
00:01:09,193 --> 00:01:12,025
Day and a half with no water,
food or cell reception.

26
00:01:12,027 --> 00:01:13,463
And the kids are terrified.

27
00:01:13,465 --> 00:01:14,463
And you two
aren't helping.

28
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:16,094
Let's just keep moving

29
00:01:16,096 --> 00:01:17,661
and try to get
back to a road.

30
00:01:17,663 --> 00:01:20,363
We'll get you out of here.
I promise.

31
00:01:25,466 --> 00:01:26,735
Whoa!

32
00:01:27,736 --> 00:01:30,332
Winds of Santa Ana.

33
00:01:30,334 --> 00:01:32,571
She's a-blowin' a-leeward
and a-windward.

34
00:01:33,772 --> 00:01:35,601
That is sailor talk.

35
00:01:35,603 --> 00:01:37,873
Actually, those terms
just relate

36
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:40,135
to one's position
to the wind.

37
00:01:40,137 --> 00:01:41,974
It's not exclusive
to sailing.

38
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,972
In fact,
I'm about to show you

39
00:01:43,974 --> 00:01:45,972
how it applies
to aeronautics.

40
00:01:45,974 --> 00:01:47,212
State the wager.

41
00:01:47,214 --> 00:01:51,117
Down the telephone wires,
straighten at ground level,

42
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,750
then across the street
and through that window.

43
00:01:53,752 --> 00:01:55,685
You're on.
If I win, dinner date.

44
00:01:55,687 --> 00:01:57,525
If you win, I do your laundry
for a month.

45
00:01:57,527 --> 00:02:01,356
You'd probably like that
more than the dinner, perv.

46
00:02:13,402 --> 00:02:16,031
I'm feeling Greek,
maybe Tex-Mex.

47
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:19,606
The bet is null and void
on account of that truck.

48
00:02:19,608 --> 00:02:21,038
You said you'd get
it in the window,

49
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,205
and it ain't
in the window.

50
00:02:22,207 --> 00:02:23,876
I'm the gambling expert.

51
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:26,075
We be datin'.

52
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:29,105
Ooh, great.

53
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,471
Coffee's ready.

54
00:02:30,473 --> 00:02:31,471
Oh.

55
00:02:31,473 --> 00:02:33,911
Yes.

56
00:02:33,913 --> 00:02:35,543
Mmm. Perfect.

57
00:02:35,545 --> 00:02:36,879
Thanks, Walter.

58
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:38,383
Walter, a minute of your time.

59
00:02:38,385 --> 00:02:40,687
Mm-hmm.

60
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:42,222
Yeah. Mmm.

61
00:02:51,358 --> 00:02:53,124
Oh. What is this?

62
00:02:53,126 --> 00:02:54,795
This is outreach.

63
00:02:54,797 --> 00:02:57,266
Now, as you know, Drew comes
back from Portland soon.

64
00:02:57,268 --> 00:02:59,697
He's gonna come back full
of confidence and swagger.

65
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:01,728
And what did those alpha-jocks
all want?

66
00:03:02,602 --> 00:03:04,967
The cheerleader.

67
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:07,336
AKA Paige Dineen.

68
00:03:07,338 --> 00:03:09,671
Why is Paige's personal life
my concern?

69
00:03:09,673 --> 00:03:11,575
Right here is why.
I've been collecting data

70
00:03:11,577 --> 00:03:12,639
on your shifting
behavior patterns

71
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:14,847
the past few months,
and the result is

72
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:18,752
an iron-clad theorem that proves
you have feelings for Paige.

73
00:03:20,723 --> 00:03:22,186
That's preposterous.

74
00:03:22,188 --> 00:03:23,154
Said the climate-change denier

75
00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:24,627
in the face of
scientific evidence.

76
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,795
While you're at it, how 'bout
you get no vaccines today?

77
00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:31,764
You want to take
this for a spin?

78
00:03:35,102 --> 00:03:37,173
Remember the reservation
you made for

79
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,574
a Valentine's Day
“work dinner”?

80
00:03:39,576 --> 00:03:40,910
We never ended up
having the meal.

81
00:03:40,912 --> 00:03:42,077
Okay.

82
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,044
How about the new

83
00:03:43,046 --> 00:03:44,748
lavender diffuser
in your office?

84
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,348
That is to mask the smell

85
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,915
of experiment-generated
mouse urine.

86
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:48,947
That's disgusting.

87
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:49,914
But also a lie.

88
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,785
Paige loves lavender.

89
00:03:51,787 --> 00:03:54,184
That hand cream of hers
is always stinking up the van.

90
00:03:55,258 --> 00:03:56,551
Finally...

91
00:03:58,354 --> 00:03:59,856
<i>...Coffea arabica.</i>

92
00:03:59,858 --> 00:04:02,096
Why do you think I've
been getting my Joe

93
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:03,359
at Kovelski's?

94
00:04:03,361 --> 00:04:06,490
Because you put cinnamon
in our pot here.

95
00:04:06,492 --> 00:04:10,256
It has antioxidants
and improves brain function.

96
00:04:10,258 --> 00:04:11,464
Cinnamon's for elves.

97
00:04:11,466 --> 00:04:12,664
You put cinnamon
in the coffee

98
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,230
because she likes it.

99
00:04:14,232 --> 00:04:16,430
You're giving her
special treatment,

100
00:04:16,432 --> 00:04:18,102
which can only mean...

101
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:22,572
And how old are you?

102
00:04:22,574 --> 00:04:24,004
13 months older than you,

103
00:04:24,006 --> 00:04:25,306
so show your elders respect.

104
00:04:25,308 --> 00:04:27,401
What is...

105
00:04:27,403 --> 00:04:30,375
What is with
the almost constantly commenting

106
00:04:30,377 --> 00:04:32,271
on me and Paige lately?

107
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,309
It's borderline obsessive.

108
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:36,045
As a student of human behavior,

109
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:38,475
I find emotional dishonesty
offensive.

110
00:04:38,477 --> 00:04:40,676
And also, you're
my friend.

111
00:04:40,678 --> 00:04:42,715
Also, I don't like Drew.

112
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:46,985
You're not saved
by the bell.

113
00:04:49,354 --> 00:04:50,752
Yeah, Cabe.

114
00:04:50,754 --> 00:04:52,015
Got a case, urgent.

115
00:04:52,017 --> 00:04:53,949
<i>We got six hikers</i>
<i>from a church group</i>

116
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:55,684
<i>lost in Los Angeles</i>
<i>National Forest.</i>

117
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:57,052
Been missing for 36 hours.

118
00:04:57,054 --> 00:04:58,989
Santa Ana winds are kicking up

119
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:01,727
<i>the forest floor,</i>
<i>killing visibility.</i>

120
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:03,495
<i>Search and rescue</i>
<i>is damn near impossible.</i>

121
00:05:03,497 --> 00:05:06,431
<i>LAFD and the Forest Service</i>
<i>need an assist.</i>

122
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:07,231
I was thinking

123
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:08,638
<i>your tracking software</i>

124
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,806
<i>from the Baghdad operation</i>
<i>years back--</i>

125
00:05:10,808 --> 00:05:13,342
<i>maybe dusting that off.</i>

126
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,290
Winds have gotten
worse since we spoke.

127
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:31,796
We don't have
any time to waste.

128
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:34,566
Must be the hikers' families.

129
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,774
Alongside members

130
00:05:36,776 --> 00:05:38,503
of their church.

131
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:43,216
My system uses a camera
and laser scanners

132
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,648
to conduct advanced
ground imaging

133
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,783
that can penetrate
tree cover

134
00:05:46,785 --> 00:05:49,781
and recognize ground patterns
at high altitudes.

135
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,253
Basically, our
stuff sees good.

136
00:05:51,255 --> 00:05:53,084
You built this for fun?

137
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,987
Well, let's just say I, uh...

138
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:59,123
I modified an old system
from way back.

139
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,596
My guys will
locate the hikers,

140
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:04,262
radio in the coordinates;
the rescue team can do its job.

141
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:05,936
We need
to see whatever

142
00:06:05,938 --> 00:06:07,369
your people have done so far.

143
00:06:11,011 --> 00:06:13,945
It's an interesting use
of my Baghdad software.

144
00:06:13,947 --> 00:06:16,249
How did you think to apply it
to this situation?

145
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,513
The truth is,

146
00:06:17,515 --> 00:06:19,986
I think about what happened
in Baghdad a lot.

147
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:21,290
What happened
between us.

148
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:22,523
Maybe your tech--

149
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:24,188
some good can come from it now.

150
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,397
Walter, you got to see this.

151
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,430
One of the kids
tweeted a picture

152
00:06:27,432 --> 00:06:29,166
right before they went
on the hike.

153
00:06:29,168 --> 00:06:30,999
They've been out of cell range
ever since.

154
00:06:31,001 --> 00:06:32,936
Well, that's all we need
to find the hikers.

155
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,038
How?

156
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,639
You've been looking
for where the hikers are.

157
00:06:35,641 --> 00:06:38,006
That's one specific place
in a specific moment in time,

158
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:39,110
and it's constantly moving.

159
00:06:39,112 --> 00:06:40,509
The footprints, however,

160
00:06:40,511 --> 00:06:42,413
they can last for hours,
even in this wind,

161
00:06:42,415 --> 00:06:44,509
and they could be
a road map right to them.

162
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:45,677
Breakdown?

163
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:48,684
Okay, so these treads
are the kids' sneakers.

164
00:06:48,686 --> 00:06:50,388
Two are piece-wise lines,

165
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,454
other is
a cross-hatch pattern.

166
00:06:52,456 --> 00:06:55,424
Approximate sizes:
two boys' size nine

167
00:06:55,426 --> 00:06:57,160
and a girls' six.

168
00:06:57,162 --> 00:06:58,929
The adults are
wearing hiking boots

169
00:06:58,931 --> 00:07:00,770
with standard waffle patterns,

170
00:07:00,772 --> 00:07:02,971
and the woman's got
an outside heel break.

171
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:04,507
Scan the images.

172
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:06,643
One of the men will be in
front, one of them in back.

173
00:07:06,645 --> 00:07:09,310
It's standard defense formation,
wired into animal DNA--

174
00:07:09,312 --> 00:07:11,087
they don't even know
they're doing it.

175
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:12,688
That woman will
most likely be

176
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,592
with the youngest girl-- a
mothering instinct to protect.

177
00:07:15,594 --> 00:07:17,392
If you look at the,
uh, body language

178
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:19,424
of these two youngsters here,
they're in love.

179
00:07:19,426 --> 00:07:20,896
They're side by side.

180
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,129
You can tell they're in love
just from the photo?

181
00:07:23,131 --> 00:07:25,865
Oh, I can tell
lots of ways.

182
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:27,865
The others will
follow standard

183
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:30,304
pack formation and fall in
here and here.

184
00:07:30,306 --> 00:07:32,839
We'll be looking
for a shape like this

185
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:34,175
filled with tread patterns

186
00:07:34,177 --> 00:07:36,206
that we can distinguish from
mountain lion drag marks,

187
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,374
windswept debris.

188
00:07:37,376 --> 00:07:39,079
That'll let us
find our folks.

189
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:42,213
Uh, where's our workstation?

190
00:07:43,352 --> 00:07:45,150
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

191
00:07:45,152 --> 00:07:47,349
no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

192
00:07:47,351 --> 00:07:48,749
Walter, I am not
going up in that thing.

193
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:50,422
Helicopters have
zero aerodynamics

194
00:07:50,424 --> 00:07:52,560
and no glide ability
in case of engine failure.

195
00:07:52,562 --> 00:07:53,529
That's our
only choice.

196
00:07:53,531 --> 00:07:54,961
It's a box
held up in the sky

197
00:07:54,963 --> 00:07:57,234
by a lawnmower blade. Pass.

198
00:07:57,236 --> 00:07:59,434
Hope you're up for a
little handholding today.

199
00:08:02,972 --> 00:08:04,970
Sly, we need you.

200
00:08:04,972 --> 00:08:06,274
No one can run

201
00:08:06,276 --> 00:08:08,178
the analytics
as fast as you can.

202
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,643
Walter, I want to help,

203
00:08:09,645 --> 00:08:12,147
but I can't willingly
board a death trap

204
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:13,282
designed by
Leonardo da Vinci

205
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,881
500 years ago.

206
00:08:14,883 --> 00:08:16,048
Then stay here!

207
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:19,983
'Cause I got a strict
no-crybabies policy.

208
00:08:19,985 --> 00:08:22,592
Meet your pilot,
Marcus Bronson.

209
00:08:22,594 --> 00:08:24,456
Look, you
don't want to come,

210
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,097
don't come,
but once you get on board,

211
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:27,793
you need keep it together,
you understand?

212
00:08:28,698 --> 00:08:30,128
It's serious
business up there.

213
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,368
I can't have anyone
freaking out in my bird.

214
00:08:33,937 --> 00:08:35,800
Hey, what'd you mean,
our pilot? You're not coming?

215
00:08:35,802 --> 00:08:37,240
There's no room in the cabin.

216
00:08:37,242 --> 00:08:39,545
So I'll stay back and
gear up with the rescue team.

217
00:08:39,547 --> 00:08:42,178
Once you send in
the hikers' locations, we go in.

218
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,780
This is a sat phone.

219
00:08:43,782 --> 00:08:46,115
Works where the
cell phones don't.

220
00:08:46,117 --> 00:08:48,724
Keep it close to you.
It's your lifeline.

221
00:08:48,726 --> 00:08:50,389
Hey!

222
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:53,230
You scratch it, you buy it.

223
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,766
He's fun.

224
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,229
Are you good?

225
00:08:57,231 --> 00:08:58,197
Sure.

226
00:08:58,199 --> 00:08:59,531
Okay. Let's go.

227
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:02,202
Okay.

228
00:09:02,204 --> 00:09:05,065
<i> We know you have</i>
<i>a lot of choices when you fly,</i>

229
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:08,801
so we want to thank you
for flying with Air Scorpion.

230
00:09:08,803 --> 00:09:10,977
Please, no
unnecessary words.

231
00:09:10,979 --> 00:09:12,905
Big guy barfs, you guys
are cleaning it up.

232
00:09:14,211 --> 00:09:15,882
Everything's going to be fine.

233
00:09:15,884 --> 00:09:19,020
Just look at your laptop and
avoid peripheral vision, okay?

234
00:09:24,926 --> 00:09:26,356
Now, our predictive model

235
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,228
says they headed downhill
west-southwest,

236
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,396
with a statistical
likelihood of 94%,

237
00:09:30,398 --> 00:09:32,130
so bank west here.

238
00:09:34,698 --> 00:09:35,832
I got a hit.

239
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:37,968
Happy, you seeing this?

240
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,368
Yup.

241
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,633
The treads match our hikers.

242
00:09:40,635 --> 00:09:41,873
The formation they're walking in

243
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,441
is spot on with my prediction.

244
00:09:43,443 --> 00:09:44,737
Okay, pilot,
stay the current course

245
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:46,145
while we close in on them.

246
00:09:46,979 --> 00:09:48,210
Ooh.

247
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,450
Everything okay?

248
00:09:49,452 --> 00:09:50,747
Wind's up to 50 knots.

249
00:09:50,749 --> 00:09:51,788
It's gonna get bumpy.

250
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,748
Hold on.

251
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,852
Cabe, do you copy?

252
00:09:53,854 --> 00:09:55,124
Copy, Walter.

253
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:56,420
It's good news.

254
00:09:56,422 --> 00:09:57,620
We found the hikers' trail.

255
00:09:57,622 --> 00:09:59,259
Within minutes, we find them.

256
00:09:59,261 --> 00:10:01,595
That's great work.
What's your location?

257
00:10:01,597 --> 00:10:03,696
Hey, Captain Charisma,
where are we?

258
00:10:03,698 --> 00:10:04,792
Damn it!

259
00:10:04,794 --> 00:10:06,927
Wind shear! Hold on!

260
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,765
Base, this is Eagle!
Do you copy?

261
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:13,029
Copy. Copy. We copy.

262
00:10:13,031 --> 00:10:14,997
Do you read?
Do you read?

263
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:16,133
We have equipment fail...

264
00:10:16,135 --> 00:10:18,173
Wind's wreaking havoc
on the comms.

265
00:10:18,175 --> 00:10:20,875
Walter! Walter, do you copy?!

266
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,939
We're gonna die!
No one's gonna die.

267
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:26,379
Mayday!

268
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:29,147
Base, this is Eagle!
We are in distress!

269
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:30,812
Repeat-- we are in distress!

270
00:10:30,814 --> 00:10:32,988
We're heading right
for those trees!

271
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,155
No, no, no, no, no!

272
00:10:34,157 --> 00:10:35,219
You steer away from the pines!

273
00:10:35,221 --> 00:10:36,452
Aim for that! The Sheoak!

274
00:10:36,454 --> 00:10:38,556
It's softer!
We'll have a much better

275
00:10:38,558 --> 00:10:39,861
chance of survival!

276
00:10:39,863 --> 00:10:42,061
Walter, 500 feet! 400 feet!

277
00:10:42,063 --> 00:10:43,798
You got to trust me!
Do it now! Do it now!

278
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,102
- Oh, my God! Oh!
- Oh, my God.

279
00:10:47,536 --> 00:10:49,838
What the hell
are you doing?!

280
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,669
Heads down! Heads down now!

281
00:10:51,671 --> 00:10:53,172
Everybody, hold on!
We're going in!

282

My duodenum.

- Everyone all right?
- I'm okay.

287
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,837
Check.

288
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,679
Terrified,
but breathing.

289
00:11:27,577 --> 00:11:29,049
Okay.

290
00:11:29,051 --> 00:11:30,114
Watch our weight
distribution

291
00:11:30,116 --> 00:11:32,084
or the bow breaks
and this cradle falls.

292
00:11:33,454 --> 00:11:35,020
You okay, boss?

293
00:11:35,022 --> 00:11:36,693
I've been better.

294
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:37,557
How bad?

295
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,557
Uh, bright blood,

296
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,862
outer left side of the thigh.

297
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:42,103
Looks like he nicked
the femoral artery,

298
00:11:42,105 --> 00:11:43,367
but it's clotted off,
stabilized.

299
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,935
How would you
know that?

300
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,535
If it hadn't,
you'd be dead.

301
00:11:46,537 --> 00:11:48,071
But that cut could expand.

302
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:49,775
We need to leave the metal in.

303
00:11:49,777 --> 00:11:51,543
You do a tourniquet,
and I'll clean it up

304
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:52,847
when we get on the ground.

305
00:11:52,849 --> 00:11:55,046
We need to get you
to a hospital ASAP.

306
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,677
Great in theory, but we are
40-feet high in a tree.

307
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,246
And our comms are dead.

308
00:11:59,248 --> 00:12:00,749
I doubt they got
a location on

309
00:12:00,751 --> 00:12:02,481
our crash site.
I can take care of that,

310
00:12:02,483 --> 00:12:04,983
but I'm gonna need everyone
to cut off their seatbelts.

311
00:12:04,985 --> 00:12:06,078
Sly, I need you to do
some math for me.

312
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,453
Okay, based on
the angle of the tree

313
00:12:08,455 --> 00:12:10,381
and the weight
distribution, uh,

314
00:12:10,383 --> 00:12:12,422
estimated by the
barycenter balancing point,

315
00:12:12,424 --> 00:12:15,189
as well as the relatively
weak tensile strength of

316
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:18,060
the River Sheoak, which is
really no more than a weed...

317
00:12:18,062 --> 00:12:19,260
Focus.
Okay.

318
00:12:19,262 --> 00:12:21,029
Bottom line is we need to remove

319
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:24,071
the weight strategically, or
we're all going to topple over--

320
00:12:24,073 --> 00:12:25,567
like Don't Tip the Waiter.

321
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:28,607
So, best guess is Happy,
then me, then Toby,

322
00:12:28,609 --> 00:12:31,072
then Marcus needs to take
some weight off the nose,

323
00:12:31,074 --> 00:12:32,143
then Walter,

324
00:12:32,145 --> 00:12:33,911
and then lastly Paige,

325
00:12:33,913 --> 00:12:36,415
because the weight displacement
in the cabin is less.

326
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:37,417
Happy,

327
00:12:37,418 --> 00:12:38,649
make it happen.

328
00:12:40,187 --> 00:12:41,785
Whoa!

329
00:12:41,787 --> 00:12:44,191
We're fine!

330
00:12:44,193 --> 00:12:45,991
Everything's fine.

331
00:12:51,998 --> 00:12:54,660
When I go down,
this thing is gonna shake.

332
00:12:54,662 --> 00:12:56,827
Just keep
your heads straight.

333
00:12:56,829 --> 00:12:58,361
We should be good.

334
00:12:58,363 --> 00:13:00,529
“Should.” Fantastic.

335
00:13:21,856 --> 00:13:23,291
Made it!

336
00:13:23,293 --> 00:13:25,093
You're up, Sylvester!

337
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,366
You know what?

338
00:13:26,368 --> 00:13:28,664
I think my calculations
were off, Happy!

339
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,602
I should go last!

340
00:13:30,604 --> 00:13:32,243
No, your calculations
were perfect,

341
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,044
and this thing's not gonna
hold much longer, okay?

342
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,149
So you go now.

343
00:13:35,151 --> 00:13:36,749
You're gonna be fine, Sly.

344
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:38,485
Okay.

345
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:39,917
Think happy thoughts.

346
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,685
Okay.

347
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,756
Geez.

348
00:13:43,758 --> 00:13:46,292
Oh, my God.

349
00:13:48,357 --> 00:13:49,491
Come on! You can do it!

350
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:51,890
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

351
00:13:54,765 --> 00:13:57,234
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

352
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,298
I can't go any further!

353
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,137
I can't... I can't go
any further!

354
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,033
Just straighten your legs.

355
00:14:11,687 --> 00:14:12,781
Hurry, guys!

356
00:14:12,783 --> 00:14:14,149
All this movement
is cracking

357
00:14:14,151 --> 00:14:15,285
the support branches!

358
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:16,485
Okay, you're up.

359
00:14:16,487 --> 00:14:17,621
Sylvester said I go last.

360
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:18,621
You're going. Now.
No.

361
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,925
No, we should do...
we should do

362
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:21,191
what Sylvester said.
No, you go.

363
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,864
Now. Go.

364
00:14:22,866 --> 00:14:23,897
Go!

365
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:26,104
Oh, my God.

366
00:14:28,073 --> 00:14:29,735
Okay.

367
00:14:33,074 --> 00:14:35,345
That's the wrong order!
That is the wrong order!

368
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,384
Hey, Walt, you better hustle!

369
00:14:39,386 --> 00:14:42,784
Walter, you've got seconds until
that helicopter is in free fall!

370
00:14:42,786 --> 00:14:44,615
The support branches
are breaking!

371
00:14:49,025 --> 00:14:50,625
- Walter!
- Walter! Walter!

372
00:14:57,894 --> 00:15:00,198
Uh...

373
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,132
looks as if things haven't
gone according to plan.

374
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,802
We call in our location

375
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:08,906
on the SAT phone,
Cabe gets us, we regroup.

376
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:18,714
We might not get the reception
we're looking for on this model.

377
00:15:26,754 --> 00:15:27,920
I have to tighten the tourniquet

378
00:15:27,922 --> 00:15:29,349
almost on top of the wound;
it's gonna hurt.

379
00:15:29,351 --> 00:15:32,251
I think you and I have
different definitions of pain.

380
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,921
Okay. So we're here.

381
00:15:35,923 --> 00:15:37,888
And with the tree cover,

382
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,894
there's no way a chopper
can land or airlift us out.

383
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:42,221
Only suitable
evac point is here.

384
00:15:42,223 --> 00:15:44,396
It's Fiddler's Basin;
it's due east.

385
00:15:47,798 --> 00:15:48,796
It's that way.

386
00:15:48,798 --> 00:15:50,268
How do you know that?

387
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,468
I point the hour hand
at the sun, I bisect the angle

388
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,339
between the hand
and the 12 to find south.

389
00:15:54,341 --> 00:15:56,805
I know south,
I know every other direction.

390
00:15:56,807 --> 00:15:58,245
Okay, so...

391
00:15:58,247 --> 00:16:00,013
we can't contact Cabe,
but we have to assume

392
00:16:00,015 --> 00:16:01,382
that he's
thinking like us

393
00:16:01,384 --> 00:16:04,015
and he knows that Fiddler's
Basin is our only shot.

394
00:16:04,017 --> 00:16:07,822
So, we follow the
hikers' footprints.

395
00:16:07,824 --> 00:16:11,686
We find them, and then we send
an overground rescue team back

396
00:16:11,688 --> 00:16:13,157
for Sylvester
and the pilot.

397
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:15,157
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

398
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,493
You're leaving me here with him?
No way.

399
00:16:16,495 --> 00:16:18,429
You can't walk.
Toby has to come with us

400
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,629
just in case there are
any injured hikers.

401
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:22,028
I do not like this plan.

402
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,234
We're in desolate woods--
no food, limited water

403
00:16:24,236 --> 00:16:25,802
and no comms.
Right.

404
00:16:25,804 --> 00:16:28,033
Then you two can work on
getting a radio sorted

405
00:16:28,035 --> 00:16:29,737
while we're gone.

406
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,241
Well, we're well aware
things would be easier

407
00:16:32,243 --> 00:16:36,208
if we still had that SAT phone,
but that is not the case.

408
00:16:41,618 --> 00:16:43,618
What was with
the swipe at me?

409
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,954
Well, if you had been
holding on

410
00:16:44,956 --> 00:16:46,322
to the SAT phone
instead of me,

411
00:16:46,324 --> 00:16:47,819
we would never be
in this mess right now.

412
00:16:47,821 --> 00:16:50,323
I was protecting you.
It was instinctive.

413
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:51,491
It was stupid.

414
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:53,964
You were an unbuckled,
150-pound projectile.

415
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:56,364
154-- I've been
working out.

416
00:16:56,366 --> 00:16:58,236
Let's get moving!

417
00:16:58,238 --> 00:17:00,436
Sun sets in
47 minutes.

418
00:17:00,438 --> 00:17:04,173
Okay, so... I'll just stay here
in the middle of the woods

419
00:17:04,175 --> 00:17:05,541
with the grumpy guy.

420
00:17:05,543 --> 00:17:07,510
Hey, stop your bellyaching,

421
00:17:07,512 --> 00:17:09,677
go fix that radio.

422
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,884
Go on!

423
00:17:25,451 --> 00:17:26,552
Sir, we spotted
the chopper's tail

424
00:17:26,554 --> 00:17:27,751
through a break
in the tree canopy.

425
00:17:27,753 --> 00:17:28,814
Cover's too thick.

426
00:17:28,816 --> 00:17:30,181
Can't make out any survivors.

427
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:32,022
Show me a topo map!
Yes, sir.

428
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:33,453
If they survive,
you think they'll try

429
00:17:33,455 --> 00:17:34,852
to keep with the mission?

430
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:36,059
There's no “if.”

431
00:17:36,061 --> 00:17:37,426
My guys survived.

432
00:17:39,028 --> 00:17:41,289
Here, Fiddler's Basin.

433
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,057
Only viable evac point.

434
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:45,234
Three miles from the crash site.
That's where we land.

435
00:17:45,236 --> 00:17:46,330
Not in this wind.

436
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:48,499
At 55 knots,
everything is grounded.

437
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:49,835
Transport helo
can handle it.

438
00:17:49,837 --> 00:17:51,404
County doesn't
have one.

439
00:17:51,406 --> 00:17:53,075
Then I'm reaching out
to Pendleton.

440
00:17:53,077 --> 00:17:56,674
There's no way I'm leaving
my guys down there!

441
00:17:58,317 --> 00:18:01,813
Hikers, we're here
to rescue you!

442
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,386
Whoa, whoa.

443
00:18:06,388 --> 00:18:09,017
So, based on the prints,

444
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:11,121
one of them
is favoring the right foot,

445
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,228
partly dragging the other;
they're probably injured.

446
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,893
Yeah, that's a
size six shoe

447
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:16,301
with a shallow depression.

448
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,301
That's Caitlin, the lightest.

449
00:18:17,303 --> 00:18:18,532
If she's hurt, they can't

450
00:18:18,534 --> 00:18:19,732
be traveling that fast.

451
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:21,602
We will find them.

452
00:18:21,604 --> 00:18:23,537
Oh, by the way,
uh, they really

453
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:26,074
stuck to that
cluster pattern you predicted.

454
00:18:26,076 --> 00:18:27,306
You were right on the money.

455
00:18:27,308 --> 00:18:30,241
Most of my behavioral
predictions turn out to be true.

456
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:33,744
For instance, what you did for
Paige up in the copter. Huh?

457
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:37,413
Letting her go first, putting
yourself at risk for her.

458
00:18:37,415 --> 00:18:40,275
I was not giving Paige
special treatment.

459
00:18:40,277 --> 00:18:42,914
I watched you almost get
pancaked by a falling aircraft.

460
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,848
You ignored Sylvester's
calculations--

461
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,213
math and science-- so that
she could descend first.

462
00:18:47,215 --> 00:18:48,885
Can we focus
on finding the hikers?

463
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:50,347
Of course.
Okay.

464
00:18:50,349 --> 00:18:51,914
May I have some of water?

465
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,584
Oh, yeah.

466
00:18:54,586 --> 00:18:57,117
The... agreed-upon ration.

467
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,284
Same as
everyone else gets.

468
00:18:59,286 --> 00:19:00,619
We're all equal.

469
00:19:01,884 --> 00:19:03,217
Thank you.

470
00:19:06,387 --> 00:19:09,658
Wow, you really
learned me there, boss.

471
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,531
You clearly
don't like her.

472
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:13,963
Guys, we got a problem!

473
00:19:13,965 --> 00:19:15,635
The trail ends here.

474
00:19:15,637 --> 00:19:17,300
The hikers crossed this field.

475
00:19:17,302 --> 00:19:19,699
They could've entered
up those woods at any point,

476
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:20,636
headed in any direction.

477
00:19:20,638 --> 00:19:22,308
We have no way
of finding them now.

478
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,475
Wait, shh, shh, shh.

479
00:19:25,941 --> 00:19:27,377
Over there.

480
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:28,913
How do you know?

481
00:19:28,915 --> 00:19:31,178
It's very scientific.
I heard them.

482
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,059
These kids
can't go much further.

483
00:19:38,061 --> 00:19:39,828
Maybe we split--

484
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,230
increase the odds
of some of us getting rescued.

485
00:19:42,232 --> 00:19:43,462
Yeah, maybe.

486
00:19:43,464 --> 00:19:44,630
I don't know.

487
00:19:44,632 --> 00:19:46,766
I don't know
what to do.

488
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,839
Hey.

489
00:19:49,673 --> 00:19:51,808
Heard you guys are lost.

490
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:54,214
Oh, thank God.
Thank you!

491
00:19:54,216 --> 00:19:55,919
Okay. Okay.

492
00:19:55,921 --> 00:19:59,085
How come he always gets the hug?
I'm standing right next to him.

493
00:19:59,087 --> 00:20:00,875
Are you guys with
the Forestry Service?

494
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:01,353
No, no.

495
00:20:01,357 --> 00:20:03,290
We're here with the government;
we're here to bring you home.

496
00:20:03,292 --> 00:20:04,491
How?

497
00:20:04,493 --> 00:20:06,355
Well, we're gonna take you
to a nearby clearing;

498
00:20:06,357 --> 00:20:07,995
there are people
who will meet us there.

499
00:20:07,997 --> 00:20:09,362
Okay, let's go.
Toby, can you check

500
00:20:09,364 --> 00:20:10,858
on the girl
with the hurt leg?

501
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,865
Let me get them some water.

502
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:15,929
Okay, let's go, kid.

503
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:17,536
What is this?

504
00:20:17,538 --> 00:20:18,431
I collect rocks.

505
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:19,598
These have
boracite in them.

506
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,366
I'm bringing them
home with me.

507
00:20:21,368 --> 00:20:23,005
Not anymore you're not.

508
00:20:23,007 --> 00:20:25,870
We're hiking for miles--
no extra weight.

509
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,172
Okay, one rock.

510
00:20:30,174 --> 00:20:32,346
Okay, are we ready?

511
00:20:32,348 --> 00:20:34,473
Yeah?

512
00:20:34,475 --> 00:20:36,682
Okay, let's go.

513
00:20:38,418 --> 00:20:39,848
Toby?

514
00:20:50,122 --> 00:20:52,919
Okay, you need to strip
those input wires.

515
00:20:52,921 --> 00:20:54,285
I don't have any wire strippers.

516
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:56,555
Just use your teeth
and your fingernails.

517
00:20:56,557 --> 00:20:58,650
This is incredibly unsanitary.

518
00:20:58,652 --> 00:21:00,522
Unsanitary? Really?

519
00:21:00,524 --> 00:21:01,922
I ate grubs and worms
for five days

520
00:21:01,924 --> 00:21:04,362
on a military exercise
when I was your age.

521
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:05,562
Good for you.
No, great for me,

522
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,393
because I learned to do
what needs to be done.

523
00:21:07,395 --> 00:21:09,193
Copy. Come in.
Oh, my God.

524
00:21:09,195 --> 00:21:10,129
Hello?

525
00:21:10,131 --> 00:21:11,529
Oh, my God,
you hear that?!

526
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:13,336
Don't talk to me,
talk to them! Talk to them!

527
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:15,871
Hello, do you
copy? Hello?

528
00:21:15,873 --> 00:21:17,166
Come in, please.

529
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,239
Hello? Come
in, please.

530
00:21:20,241 --> 00:21:22,670
Come on, come
on, come on.

531
00:21:27,175 --> 00:21:29,015
I'm sorry.

532
00:21:36,222 --> 00:21:37,716
What?

533
00:21:37,718 --> 00:21:38,884
You're not gonna
say anything?

534
00:21:38,886 --> 00:21:40,588
I already said
I'm sorry.

535
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,557
Okay.

536
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:43,292
I get it. I get it.

537
00:21:43,294 --> 00:21:45,492
Maybe if I rewired
the entire radio

538
00:21:45,494 --> 00:21:47,595
with my mouth
full of beetle larvae,

539
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,594
maybe then I would have
done a better job for you.

540
00:21:49,596 --> 00:21:51,361
Kid, kid, look, look.

541
00:21:51,363 --> 00:21:53,369
Oh, no.

542
00:21:55,307 --> 00:21:56,601
You smell smoke?

543
00:21:56,603 --> 00:21:57,936
There must be
a fire somewhere.

544
00:21:57,938 --> 00:21:59,302
Is that an ember?

545
00:21:59,304 --> 00:22:01,205
Whoa.

546
00:22:02,342 --> 00:22:03,708
Ah, that was close.

547
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,004
Um, Walter.

548
00:22:05,006 --> 00:22:06,539
Yeah?

549
00:22:13,308 --> 00:22:14,769
Oh, boy.

550
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,134
You need to hurry up kid!

551
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,127
I'm well aware that a
forest fire can spread

552
00:22:30,127 --> 00:22:31,294
at 22 feet per second.

553
00:22:31,296 --> 00:22:32,558
Fire's circling
around us.

554
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,326
That loop closes,
then we're cooked, literally.

555
00:22:34,328 --> 00:22:36,367
Okay, I just need to
secure one more seat belt.

556
00:22:36,369 --> 00:22:37,567
All right.

557
00:22:37,569 --> 00:22:39,239
And you're okay to lay
on this on your back?

558
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:40,303
Of course I am.
Great.

559
00:22:41,537 --> 00:22:44,073
Hey, take my arm,
take my arm, okay?

560
00:22:44,075 --> 00:22:46,082
Your leg has a lot
more blood on it.

561
00:22:46,084 --> 00:22:47,611
Are you okay?
I'm fine, I'm fine.

562
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:48,915
Just get me on there.

563
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:50,050
Easy, easy.

564
00:22:50,052 --> 00:22:52,320
Strap yourself
in there.

565
00:22:53,489 --> 00:22:55,316
You sure this is gonna hold?

566
00:22:55,318 --> 00:22:57,282
It only needs to hold us
for three miles

567
00:22:57,284 --> 00:22:58,554
until Fiddler's Basin.

568
00:22:58,556 --> 00:23:00,521
Your friends took the map.
You remember where it is?

569
00:23:00,523 --> 00:23:02,184
I have a photographic memory.

570
00:23:02,186 --> 00:23:03,784
Of course you do. Let's go!

571
00:23:03,786 --> 00:23:05,856
Let's go!

572
00:23:07,161 --> 00:23:08,823
My eyes are burning.

573
00:23:08,825 --> 00:23:10,189
It's getting
hard to breathe.

574
00:23:10,191 --> 00:23:13,355
Okay, hold on.

575
00:23:13,357 --> 00:23:14,691
Will you grab that out?

576
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:16,658
Grab that.

577
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,194
Okay, now hold that up
to your nose and mouth.

578
00:23:25,107 --> 00:23:26,337
Here you go.

579
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:28,303
Whoa, what the hell
are you doing?

580
00:23:28,305 --> 00:23:31,006
I'm helping you, like I was
trying to on the helicopter.

581
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:32,502
That's all, just help.

582
00:23:32,504 --> 00:23:34,373
I do not need someone
to take care of me.

583
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:35,676
Hey.

584
00:23:35,678 --> 00:23:37,307
You kissed me.

585
00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:39,210
And now that
I'm responding to that,

586
00:23:39,212 --> 00:23:40,577
you're scared
and shutting down.

587
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:42,112
I am surrounded by fire.

588
00:23:42,114 --> 00:23:44,007
We have kids to save,
not to mention ourselves.

589
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:45,646
Not the time.

590
00:23:56,582 --> 00:23:57,715
What's up?

591
00:23:57,717 --> 00:23:59,345
See for yourself.

592
00:24:01,745 --> 00:24:03,814
What now?

593
00:24:03,816 --> 00:24:05,685
There's got to
be a way around.

594
00:24:05,687 --> 00:24:09,348
We'd be moving laterally as
the fire proceeds in this way.

595
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,683
If we pick the wrong
direction, then...

596
00:24:10,685 --> 00:24:11,851
We're dead.

597
00:24:11,853 --> 00:24:14,050
How long would
you say we have?

598
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:15,386
We've got
about ten minutes.

599
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:16,890
We've got
to get across.

600
00:24:16,892 --> 00:24:19,923
Start looking for long branches
strong enough to hold us.

601
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,964
Maybe we, uh,
we bind them together,

602
00:24:21,966 --> 00:24:23,163
then we reach across.

603
00:24:23,165 --> 00:24:25,098
Oh, bro, that sounds
like suicide.

604
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,665
Staying here is suicide.

605
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:28,337
Come on,
start looking.

606
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:30,368
Walter, I'm sorry,
this is all my fault.

607
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,936
You didn't start the wildfire.

608
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:33,935
I took everyone off the
trail, got everyone lost,

609
00:24:33,937 --> 00:24:35,806
all because I wanted to
find the perfect spot

610
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,037
for Jenna, to
propose to her.

611
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,676
And now she's gonna
die, everyone,

612
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:39,843
because of me.

613
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,170
You want to undo that?

614
00:24:41,172 --> 00:24:42,874
Help us get over that ravine.

615
00:24:42,876 --> 00:24:44,506
All right?

616
00:24:44,508 --> 00:24:46,074
What's she doing?

617
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,680
Any of you guys ever rope-swing?

618
00:24:59,516 --> 00:25:01,586
I-I got to catch my breath.

619
00:25:01,588 --> 00:25:03,289
It's on account
of the smoke.

620
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:05,025
You got to push
through it, kid,

621
00:25:05,027 --> 00:25:06,793
'cause I'm looking at a blaze
coming over that hill

622
00:25:06,795 --> 00:25:08,289
right toward us.

623
00:25:10,026 --> 00:25:12,294
It's faster than I am.
I can't outrun it.

624
00:25:12,296 --> 00:25:13,996
Like hell you can't!

625
00:25:13,998 --> 00:25:16,223
Now get your ass
in gear now! Move!

626
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:17,191
Don't yell at me.

627
00:25:17,193 --> 00:25:18,622
I'm about to burn to death!

628
00:25:18,624 --> 00:25:21,426
Now grow a pair, son,
and Oscar Mike now!

629
00:25:21,428 --> 00:25:23,059
Stop.

630
00:25:23,061 --> 00:25:26,763
Military talk and berating
won't work with me.

631
00:25:26,765 --> 00:25:28,227
It never has.

632
00:25:28,229 --> 00:25:30,203
I have done the calculations!

633
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:32,267
My fastest rate of speed,
the decline angle of this hill,

634
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:34,171
the pace of the fire,
the dryness of the underbrush--

635
00:25:34,173 --> 00:25:37,443
a gazelle would be
taken in minutes.

636
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:39,579
You and I have seconds!

637
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:44,079
Son, doing nothing isn't
an option for either of us.

638
00:25:44,081 --> 00:25:46,711
Listen to me.

639
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:49,782
We got to figure a way
to move faster than this fire,

640
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:51,484
or we're both dead.

641
00:25:51,486 --> 00:25:54,148
Do you understand?

642
00:25:56,917 --> 00:25:59,450
We can't,
but we may not need to.

643
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,559
Okay, at least the
hold is secure.

644
00:26:04,561 --> 00:26:06,990
Can't help but notice
you haven't swung out yet.

645
00:26:06,992 --> 00:26:08,261
Yeah, about that--

646
00:26:08,263 --> 00:26:09,988
this tree could totally
be rotted out inside.

647
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,753
A person's weight
could snap it in half.

648
00:26:11,755 --> 00:26:13,792
Yeah, and fall 50 feet to their death.
Yup.

649
00:26:13,794 --> 00:26:16,096
We've got to do something;
the fire's getting closer.

650
00:26:16,098 --> 00:26:17,528
Well, unless we got
a human guinea pig

651
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,833
who wants to test
this thing out...

652
00:26:23,604 --> 00:26:25,371
Whoa.

653
00:26:27,173 --> 00:26:29,179
Yeah.

654
00:26:29,181 --> 00:26:31,115
It'll hold.

655
00:26:35,453 --> 00:26:36,955
It's getting closer.

656
00:26:36,957 --> 00:26:39,019
We got to move faster.
I know, I know.

657
00:26:39,021 --> 00:26:40,052
Let's go!

658
00:26:40,054 --> 00:26:41,619
Okay. Here.

659
00:26:41,621 --> 00:26:43,089
Are you sure
about this?

660
00:26:43,091 --> 00:26:45,425
Yes. Back in here.
Watch your head.

661
00:26:45,427 --> 00:26:46,625
Thanks.

662
00:26:48,827 --> 00:26:51,296
Oh. Okay, okay.

663
00:26:55,435 --> 00:26:57,737
We're gonna be baked alive in here.
No.

664
00:26:57,739 --> 00:27:00,273
The door's made of titanium;
it's a low conductor of heat.

665
00:27:00,275 --> 00:27:01,840
You better be
right, kid.

666
00:27:01,842 --> 00:27:02,775
Oh, my God!

667
00:27:02,777 --> 00:27:04,142
Get down!
Get down! Cover!

668
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,761
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

669
00:27:31,763 --> 00:27:34,663
Careful with your leg.
Careful with your leg.

670
00:27:34,665 --> 00:27:36,364
Okay.

671
00:27:39,628 --> 00:27:41,025
You okay?

672
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:42,800
Breathing.

673
00:27:42,802 --> 00:27:44,127
Barely.

674
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,703
Oh, man, your leg's
losing a lot of blood.

675
00:27:46,705 --> 00:27:48,967
I have to tighten
your tourniquet.

676
00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:51,271
Do your worst.

677
00:27:54,242 --> 00:27:57,743
That should hold
it for a bit.

678
00:27:57,745 --> 00:27:58,975
Thanks.

679
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:01,311
I got to hand it to you,
that was quick thinking

680
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:02,783
with the pipe.

681
00:28:02,785 --> 00:28:04,183
We got to move.

682
00:28:04,185 --> 00:28:06,150
This door has been
warped by the heat.

683
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:08,189
I think I can fix it.

684
00:28:08,191 --> 00:28:09,685
Hey, hey.

685
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,756
Use this.

686
00:28:11,758 --> 00:28:13,458
Thank you.

687
00:28:19,396 --> 00:28:21,425
So I take it your dad
was military?

688
00:28:21,427 --> 00:28:23,393
Very.

689
00:28:23,395 --> 00:28:25,528
You guys didn't
get along too well?

690
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:28,799
Well, my father comes from a
world where a man is measured by

691
00:28:28,801 --> 00:28:31,103
how many tackles
he made in high school

692
00:28:31,105 --> 00:28:34,337
or how many beer cans
he can crush against his skull.

693
00:28:35,979 --> 00:28:37,680
Same world that you come from.

694
00:28:39,712 --> 00:28:42,777
Okay, guys, about a
quarter mile, we dogleg right,

695
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:44,577
then it's a straight
shot from there.

696
00:28:44,579 --> 00:28:48,080
About, uh, 500 feet,
five percent grade.

697
00:28:48,082 --> 00:28:50,822
Okay, Toby?
Follow. Great.

698
00:28:50,823 --> 00:28:52,352
Come on, guys, got to
make it to the clearing.

699
00:28:52,354 --> 00:28:54,615
Let's start rationing out the
water-- give us a little lift.

700
00:28:54,617 --> 00:28:56,287
You can take my share
if you want.

701
00:28:56,289 --> 00:28:57,919
No. You need
as much as anyone.

702
00:28:57,921 --> 00:28:59,423
Thank you though.

703
00:28:59,425 --> 00:29:03,093
Walter, get down here! The
basin's just around that bend.

704
00:29:03,095 --> 00:29:04,524
This is the only way through.

705
00:29:04,526 --> 00:29:06,293
This gully is
creating a funnel effect

706
00:29:06,295 --> 00:29:07,630
that's pulling
the fires together.

707
00:29:07,632 --> 00:29:08,861
We got to run.
Okay, okay.

708
00:29:08,863 --> 00:29:10,068
Come on. Come on, guys.

709
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,964
You heard her.

710
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:18,805
Come on!

711
00:29:20,647 --> 00:29:22,846
Hurry, the wall's closing!

712
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,449
You're okay.
You're okay.

713
00:29:30,428 --> 00:29:31,194
Walter!

714
00:29:31,196 --> 00:29:33,497
Walter!

715
00:29:33,499 --> 00:29:34,826
Jimmy, you're okay!

716
00:29:34,828 --> 00:29:36,793
I'm fine, I'm fine.
You got to be careful.

717
00:29:36,795 --> 00:29:38,297
You don't want
to burn out.

718
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:40,297
Too soon?

719
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:43,200
Guys, the fire's gonna fill up
the clearing before we know it.

720
00:29:43,202 --> 00:29:46,039
We got to move.
Over there, come on!

721
00:29:52,312 --> 00:29:54,340
Hold up! Wait.

722
00:29:54,342 --> 00:29:55,905
We're stuck.

723
00:29:55,907 --> 00:29:57,378
All right.

724
00:29:58,348 --> 00:30:00,345
Stop, stop, stop.

725
00:30:00,347 --> 00:30:02,912
This contraption of yours
isn't going anywhere.

726
00:30:02,914 --> 00:30:04,814
Okay.

727
00:30:04,816 --> 00:30:07,381
Give me a second.
Let me see if I can fix it.

728
00:30:07,383 --> 00:30:08,413
No, no.

729
00:30:08,415 --> 00:30:09,685
Stop. Just stop.

730
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:12,453
Look, I'm dead weight.

731
00:30:12,455 --> 00:30:14,557
You're dead on your feet.
We're out of water.

732
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,324
You're cramping up.

733
00:30:16,326 --> 00:30:18,090
At this rate,
we're not gonna go

734
00:30:18,092 --> 00:30:20,089
another ten inches,
let alone another mile.

735
00:30:20,091 --> 00:30:22,425
I'm not going to abandon you.

736
00:30:22,427 --> 00:30:24,068
It's not your call.

737
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:27,300
This gully is filling up
with smoke.

738
00:30:27,302 --> 00:30:29,867
There will not be
enough oxygen left.

739
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,370
If I leave you, you will die.

740
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,778
We both die if you stay.

741
00:30:42,349 --> 00:30:44,146
What are you doing?

742
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:48,048
I'm saving your life, son. Go!

743
00:30:49,089 --> 00:30:50,790
Go.

744
00:30:53,822 --> 00:30:55,851
We're coming up
on the crash site.

745
00:30:57,061 --> 00:30:59,355
Light it up!

746
00:31:05,958 --> 00:31:07,428
I'm sorry, Agent.

747
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:10,261
<i>Staying ahead of this fire,</i>
<i>even for smoke jumpers,</i>

748
00:31:10,263 --> 00:31:11,934
would be damn near impossible.

749
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,007
Take us to Fiddler's Basin.

750
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:18,640
We'll be flying right
into the fire front.

751
00:31:18,642 --> 00:31:20,679
Visibility will be low to nil.

752
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:23,013
I don't see any bodies
by the chopper.

753
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:25,308
Now, my guys are survivors.

754
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,716
Don't make me ask again.

755
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,051
Let's head to the basin.

756
00:31:34,453 --> 00:31:36,588
We can't make it to the basin.

757
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,788
We can't go back.

758
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,460
Oh, my God.
We're trapped.

759
00:31:39,462 --> 00:31:41,261
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

760
00:31:41,263 --> 00:31:42,333
Shh, shh.

761
00:31:42,335 --> 00:31:43,597
Listen. Listen.

762
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,836
A helicopter.

763
00:31:45,838 --> 00:31:47,365
It's Cabe.

764
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:49,270
Hey!

765
00:31:49,272 --> 00:31:50,941
They're never gonna see us
through the smoke.

766
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:53,109
Flashlights. Flashlights!

767
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:54,446
Hey!

768
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,244
I don't see anybody.

769
00:31:59,246 --> 00:32:00,411
You?
Not yet.

770
00:32:00,413 --> 00:32:02,580
That fire line
to the west

771
00:32:02,582 --> 00:32:05,757
is cutting off any
route into that basin.

772
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:06,885
Wherever they are,

773
00:32:06,887 --> 00:32:09,590
they are not making
it to the clearing.

774
00:32:09,592 --> 00:32:12,729
Sir, soot can
choke our engine.

775
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:15,098
Respectfully,
there is no point

776
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,105
in all of us dying.

777
00:32:17,107 --> 00:32:19,273
We need to go, sir.

778
00:32:26,914 --> 00:32:27,944
Hey!

779
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,844
Come on!

780
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,061
Pete, Pete, Pete.
Her hand.

781
00:32:46,063 --> 00:32:48,229
Give me the ring that you
were gonna put on that hand.

782
00:32:48,231 --> 00:32:50,102
The engagement ring.
I need that diamond.

783
00:32:50,104 --> 00:32:51,198
Give me the diamond.

784
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,302
Congratulations.

785
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:53,967
Toby.

786
00:32:53,969 --> 00:32:55,841
What are you thinking?

787
00:32:57,811 --> 00:32:59,810
We need to create
a signal flare.

788
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:01,018
And what is
the one element

789
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,386
that we have
in spades around here?

790
00:33:02,388 --> 00:33:03,386
That would be fire.

791
00:33:03,388 --> 00:33:05,080
Exactly.
And thanks to Jimmy,

792
00:33:05,082 --> 00:33:07,014
we have boron.

793
00:33:07,016 --> 00:33:09,222
Now, fires out there
are burning upwards

794
00:33:09,224 --> 00:33:10,854
of 4,000 degrees.

795
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:13,958
Boron melts at 3,700.

796
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,022
You insured that, right?

797
00:33:15,024 --> 00:33:17,389
Boron also has
a deoxidizing effect...

798
00:33:18,358 --> 00:33:20,429
...on white gold,
all of which

799
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:24,435
combine to form
a green plume of smoke!

800
00:33:33,504 --> 00:33:35,437
Come on. Come on.

801
00:33:43,215 --> 00:33:44,949
There!

802
00:33:44,951 --> 00:33:46,549
Right there! A signal!

803
00:33:46,551 --> 00:33:48,350
Where?
Right there! Green smoke!

804
00:33:48,352 --> 00:33:49,982
They're still alive!
Turn it around!

805
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:51,390
Turn around!

806
00:33:51,392 --> 00:33:53,726
Douse those in water
and hold over your faces.

807
00:33:53,728 --> 00:33:55,423
This one's empty.

808
00:33:55,425 --> 00:33:57,991
So is my canteen.
Oh, we're losing the signal.

809
00:33:57,993 --> 00:33:59,359
Oh, God, this is it.

810
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:27,914
Happy, I'm not
gonna apologize

811
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:29,618
for what I did earlier,
'cause I wanted to protect you.

812
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,546
By now, I figured
you'd know why,

813
00:34:31,548 --> 00:34:34,083
but in case you don't know,
I want my last words

814
00:34:34,085 --> 00:34:35,186
to have some meaning.

815
00:34:35,188 --> 00:34:36,657
So, Happy Quinn, I am in love...

816
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,489
Perfect timing.

817
00:34:40,491 --> 00:34:41,761
Let's go! Let's go!

818
00:34:41,763 --> 00:34:42,929
Got our chopper 20 yards south!

819
00:34:42,931 --> 00:34:45,066
Where's Sylvester?

820
00:34:45,068 --> 00:34:46,163
I thought he was with you.

821
00:34:46,165 --> 00:34:47,803
No, we left him
at the crash site.

822
00:34:47,805 --> 00:34:49,697
Crash site got burned over,
Walter. Let's go.

823
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:51,633
Come on. Let's go, son!

824
00:34:53,704 --> 00:34:55,102
We got to evac now!

825
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,838
We have to wait
for Sylvester.

826
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,806
Fire's too close.

827
00:34:58,808 --> 00:35:00,174
We got to go!

828
00:35:00,176 --> 00:35:01,445
Not without our man!

829
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:02,772
I know Sylvester.

830
00:35:02,774 --> 00:35:04,379
He thinks like us.
He will make it here.

831
00:35:04,381 --> 00:35:05,641
And I'm not gonna leave
without him.

832
00:35:05,643 --> 00:35:07,607
We can look
for him when we're back

833
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:10,175
up top again.
We need to go now, sir.

834
00:35:10,177 --> 00:35:12,344
Negative! Not an option!

835
00:35:20,492 --> 00:35:21,394
There! There! There! There!

836
00:35:21,396 --> 00:35:22,531
Walter!

837
00:35:22,533 --> 00:35:24,596
Put him down. Put him down.
It's okay, buddy.

838
00:35:33,374 --> 00:35:35,812
Toby, he's lost
a lot of blood.

839
00:35:39,646 --> 00:35:41,612
All right,
let's move out!

840
00:35:59,232 --> 00:36:01,429
Sounds like they're getting
a handle on the fire.

841
00:36:01,431 --> 00:36:03,228
Should have it contained
by nightfall.

842
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:07,268
Look, I know we've had some
close calls together, but...

843
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,869
today was extra dicey.

844
00:36:08,871 --> 00:36:10,142
Aw.

845
00:36:10,144 --> 00:36:11,743
You were worried about us.

846
00:36:11,745 --> 00:36:14,081
In so many words, yes.

847
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:16,282
I'm glad you're all okay.

848

Guys, we're
growing on him.
