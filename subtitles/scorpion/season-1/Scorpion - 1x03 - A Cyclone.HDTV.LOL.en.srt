1
00:00:06,274 --> 00:00:07,941
<i>My name is Walter O'Brien.</i>

2
00:00:07,943 --> 00:00:12,312
<i>I have the fourth highest IQ</i>
<i><i><i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

3
00:00:12,314 --> 00:00:14,114
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

4
00:00:14,116 --> 00:00:16,649
<i>When I was 11,
the FBI</i> <i>arrested me for hacking NASA</i>

5
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:19,352
<i>to get their blueprints</i> <i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

6
00:00:19,354 --> 00:00:21,554
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

7
00:00:21,556 --> 00:00:22,989
<i>tackling worldwide threats</i>

8
00:00:22,991 --> 00:00:24,557
<i>only we can solve.</i>

9
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:26,359
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

10
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:28,127
<i>Sylvester's a human calculator.</i>

11
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:30,430
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

12
00:00:30,432 --> 00:00:32,599
<i>Agent Cabe Gallo's</i> <i>our government handler.</i>

13
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:34,834
<i>And Paige?</i> <i>Well, Paige isn't like us.</i>

14
00:00:34,836 --> 00:00:37,303
<i>She's normal</i> <i>and translates the world for us</i>

15
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:39,973
<i>while we help her understand</i> <i>her genius son.</i>

16
00:00:39,975 --> 00:00:42,075
<i>Together, we are Scorpion.</i>

17
00:00:43,077 --> 00:00:44,577
Sylvester only seconds behind!

18
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:45,611
Oh, my!

19
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:47,580
But he is displaying facial stressors.

20
00:00:47,582 --> 00:00:48,681
Will he choke?

21
00:00:48,683 --> 00:00:49,949
Will... he... choke?

22
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:51,617
Toby! Just. J... okay?

23
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:52,885
The pace is breakneck.

24
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:54,454
The tension is high.

25
00:00:54,456 --> 00:00:55,555
Children.

26
00:00:55,557 --> 00:00:56,789
Ladies and Gentlemen,

27
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:59,392
This is not for the
pregnant or faint of heart.

28
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,396
Oh, oh, oh!

29
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:05,631
It's the old blind-bomber trick!

30
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:08,834
It's gutsy, it's cocky,
it could serve to psych out Dodd!

31
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:10,369
- No. 
- What? N-No.

32
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:11,937
No. Oh, no! Dodd rallies!

33
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,139
Dodd rallies!

34
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:14,407
Time!

35
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:16,842
Oh, oh. Ooh.

36
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:20,279
What the hell's going on?

37
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:21,914
Walter wins. As usual.

38
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,883
By a hair, pal. By a hair.

39
00:01:23,885 --> 00:01:26,051
Team of Einsteins,
none of you could tell time?!

40
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:27,653
Turn that noise off! We're late!

41
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:28,687
Let's move!

42
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,055
Oh, we were just blowing off steam, Cabe.

43
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:31,390
We're ready. Well, you better be.

44
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,092
The future of the team depends on it.

45
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:34,660
Director Merrick already thinks I'm crazy

46
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:36,061
for forming a team of geniuses.

47
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:38,497
We got to prove him wrong.

48
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:39,765
Guys, guys, guys.

49
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:41,700
He's right.

50
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:42,868
This exercise is a huge opportunity

51
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,937
for our company; for all of us.

52
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,072
I know we can do this. We're ready.

53
00:01:47,098 --> 00:01:48,297
All right.

54
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,377
Forgot my hat.

55
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:53,178
Are you kidding me?!

56
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,613
Let's go!

57
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,116
Hurry up already!

58
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:59,572
Come on, come on.

59
00:01:59,598 --> 00:02:00,898
What's the delay?

60
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,399
These have been here since yesterday!

61
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:03,434
Move!

62
00:02:03,436 --> 00:02:05,102
Nemos, I just wanted to return my uniform

63
00:02:05,104 --> 00:02:06,503
and get my last check.

64
00:02:08,273 --> 00:02:10,607
I don't understand this new job of yours.

65
00:02:10,609 --> 00:02:12,009
Brilliant people.

66
00:02:12,011 --> 00:02:14,611
- I mean, what are they? Scientists?
- Geniuses.

67
00:02:14,613 --> 00:02:16,647
Kind of a liaison to regular people.

68
00:02:16,649 --> 00:02:19,116
You know me... good with customers.

69
00:02:19,118 --> 00:02:20,083
Yes, I know.

70
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:21,885
That's why you should stay.

71
00:02:21,887 --> 00:02:24,021
How many times does an opportunity like this

72
00:02:24,023 --> 00:02:25,222
come along for me...

73
00:02:25,224 --> 00:02:26,857
for my son?

74
00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:29,473
And I never know what this job will bring,

75
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:32,796
but it's always exciting.

76
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,246
Walter, this is a mistake.

77
00:02:49,248 --> 00:02:50,413
I'm not prepared for this.

78
00:02:50,415 --> 00:02:51,581
I've got your back, buddy.

79
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:52,749
I've always got your back, okay?

80
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:53,917
Approaching the hot point.

81
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,585
Delta Team quells the insurgency.

82
00:02:55,587 --> 00:02:57,287
Omega, locate the comm room.

83
00:02:57,289 --> 00:02:58,688
Shepherds, the SMACKs.

84
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,323
You got 30 seconds to download that file.

85
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:01,791
You copy?

86
00:03:01,793 --> 00:03:02,926
I'm clear on everything,

87
00:03:02,928 --> 00:03:04,794
except why you keep calling us “SMACKS”"

88
00:03:04,796 --> 00:03:06,963
<i>It's an army funny.</i>

89
00:03:06,965 --> 00:03:10,667
SMACK... Soldier, minus ability,
coordination and knowledge.

90
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:13,236
The Federal Government,
good at acronyms and nothing else.

91
00:03:13,238 --> 00:03:15,705
Does he know that I'm
Director of Homeland Security?

92
00:03:15,707 --> 00:03:16,873
Your superior?

93
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,342
They're just civilians.

94
00:03:20,511 --> 00:03:22,245
<i> Got eyes on the compound.</i> <i>Moving in.</i>

95
00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:23,980
Move, move, move, move, move, move.

96
00:03:23,982 --> 00:03:26,816
I have plantar fasciitis.

97
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:28,685
Go. All right.

98
00:03:29,887 --> 00:03:32,422
I designed the
breach-device for a hard torque,

99
00:03:32,424 --> 00:03:34,490
so put your back into it.

100
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,637
Down, down! Get down!

101
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,539
Come on, SMACKs. Move!

102
00:03:49,565 --> 00:03:50,864
30 seconds to download the file!

103
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,627
All right.
Sylvester, you take the right.

104
00:03:52,653 --> 00:03:54,019
Faster than that! Let's go, boys!

105
00:03:54,045 --> 00:03:56,112
Yeah, okay. Are you in?

106
00:03:56,114 --> 00:03:59,649
Walter, there is encryption
at the firmware level.

107
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:01,984
Damn it. This thing's in 
Arabic-Sudanese Unicode.

108
00:04:01,986 --> 00:04:03,619
I'm panicking! I-I-I'm panicking!

109
00:04:03,621 --> 00:04:05,921
We don't have time for this!
-  Okay, okay, okay, okay.

110
00:04:05,923 --> 00:04:07,223
Let's go, SMACKs! Come on!
Okay, we'll adapt.

111
00:04:07,225 --> 00:04:08,591
Perimeter breach! 15 seconds!

112
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:10,159
- I'm done.
- I can't concentrate.

113
00:04:10,161 --> 00:04:12,641
I can't do this.
I-I got you, buddy. I got ya.

114
00:04:14,331 --> 00:04:15,898
Three seconds! You hear me?!

115
00:04:17,764 --> 00:04:19,335
I got the file.

116
00:04:19,337 --> 00:04:20,503
- I got the file. 
- Okay.

117
00:04:20,505 --> 00:04:21,637
- Okay. Okay.
- We're overdue!

118
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,738
Come on! Go, go, go...!

119
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,440
All right! All right, where are we going?

120
00:04:24,442 --> 00:04:26,909
- Where are we going? 
- Go straight! Go!

121
00:04:28,278 --> 00:04:30,246
Oh, God.

122
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:34,016
I'm so sorry, Walter.

123
00:04:34,018 --> 00:04:36,251
They're captured.

124
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:40,356
What's with the full contact, Agent Gallo?

125
00:04:43,705 --> 00:04:45,463
Fall out!

126
00:04:45,544 --> 00:04:47,711
All right! Break it up, break it up!

127
00:04:47,713 --> 00:04:50,114
This is meant to impress me.

128
00:04:50,116 --> 00:04:51,415
Your human calculator froze.

129
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:54,518
Your engineer has no
concept of following orders.

130
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,652
And your shrink...

131
00:04:55,654 --> 00:04:56,887
I don't know where to begin.

132
00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:58,689
You can start by being nicer.

133
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:01,491
We were doing fine until
that jarhead got handsy.

134
00:05:01,493 --> 00:05:03,594
Where'd he touch you, exactly?

135
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:04,995
Guys, uh... Director Merrick...

136
00:05:04,997 --> 00:05:06,730
...the, uh, Marines

137
00:05:06,732 --> 00:05:10,901
talking smack in the Humvee
caused a distraction.

138
00:05:10,903 --> 00:05:13,637
Questioning our entry point cost us time.

139
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,671
26 seconds.

140
00:05:14,673 --> 00:05:15,706
To be exact.

141
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,208
Their approach slowed us down.

142
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,057
The purpose of this exercise was to see

143
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,390
if your purported group of geniuses

144
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,446
could contribute to a
high-end military operation.

145
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:31,459
I have seen nothing that makes
me believe that that's possible.

146
00:05:31,485 --> 00:05:33,018
And I'm starting to wonder

147
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,053
if funding this group was a mistake.

148
00:05:35,055 --> 00:05:38,490
They have no further duties
until you hear from me.

149
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:45,530
Ralph, we talked about this.

150
00:05:45,532 --> 00:05:48,095
Going to school is your job. 
You need to go.

151
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:51,736
I'm still nervous about my new job,
but I need to go, too.

152
00:05:51,738 --> 00:05:56,608
Be determined to have a
great day and you will.

153
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,277
And do you know what I see over there?

154
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,946
I see that little boy wearing a t-shirt

155
00:06:00,948 --> 00:06:03,882
from L.A. Science and Cultural Center.

156
00:06:03,884 --> 00:06:05,650
You love that place.

157
00:06:05,652 --> 00:06:08,212
I'd call that an ice breaker, right?

158
00:06:09,355 --> 00:06:11,423
You're gonna be okay.

159
00:06:11,425 --> 00:06:12,590
Are you sure?

160
00:06:12,592 --> 00:06:13,872
Mm-hmm.

161
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,828
Okay. Go.

162
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,963
I love you.

163
00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:32,944
Hey.

164
00:06:32,946 --> 00:06:34,012
How'd it go?

165
00:06:34,014 --> 00:06:35,079
For a Government Endeavor?

166
00:06:35,081 --> 00:06:36,948
About how you'd expect.

167
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,350
Time for me to get chewed out again.

168
00:06:39,352 --> 00:06:41,019
Yes, sir. Director Merrick.

169
00:06:41,021 --> 00:06:42,353
Oh, okay.

170
00:06:42,355 --> 00:06:46,024
Uh... I-I brought bagels from
Kovelsky's on the corner.

171
00:06:46,026 --> 00:06:47,659
You're not a waitress, Paige.

172
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:49,427
Though you may be again soon,

173
00:06:49,429 --> 00:06:52,497
if we don't iron out our issues.

174
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:54,699
The training mission report.

175
00:06:59,872 --> 00:07:01,346
She hit a Marine?

176
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:03,941
Yeah, this was our chance
to prove ourselves,

177
00:07:03,943 --> 00:07:05,510
and we end up, uh,

178
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:07,578
self-destructing like we always do.

179
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,981
What... what can I do?

180
00:07:09,983 --> 00:07:12,416
Find a way to fix us.

181
00:07:21,226 --> 00:07:22,827
Hey, Happy.

182
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:25,096
I appreciate what you're doing,

183
00:07:25,098 --> 00:07:28,232
but I just need to settle down first.

184
00:07:28,234 --> 00:07:29,934
Check in with me Saturday.

185
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:33,637
<i> You still don't</i> <i>know us that well.</i>

186
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:36,574
Happy suffers from hostility
and anger dissonance syndrome.

187
00:07:36,576 --> 00:07:38,509
Sylvester's anxiety, OCD,

188
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:40,377
and more phobias than you shake a stick at.

189
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:44,381
Walter is textbook intellectualmegolomania

190
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,650
and anti-obedience syndrome.

191
00:07:46,652 --> 00:07:49,019
That should be fun to see
how that plays out with Cabe.

192
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:51,255
Me? I am a narcissist

193
00:07:51,257 --> 00:07:53,691
with a slight dusting
of addiction tendencies.

194
00:07:53,693 --> 00:07:55,893
So, welcome aboard.

195
00:08:05,771 --> 00:08:07,504
Yeah!

196
00:08:07,506 --> 00:08:09,373
The Scorpions!

197
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,108
It's our theme song!

198
00:08:12,877 --> 00:08:15,679
Is this how Ralph feels,
being boxed out by other kids?

199
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:18,949
You just need a little more time to fit in.

200
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:20,851
You'll be fine.

201
00:08:20,853 --> 00:08:22,119
And so will Ralph.

202
00:08:22,121 --> 00:08:24,321
What is happening?

203
00:08:24,323 --> 00:08:26,356
Our wireless is down.

204
00:08:26,358 --> 00:08:27,491
How on earth is our wireless down?

205
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:29,526
That call from Merrick was about a bomb.

206
00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:31,294
Took out a law firm at One Wilton.

207
00:08:31,296 --> 00:08:33,029
Homeland responds to all bombings.

208
00:08:33,031 --> 00:08:35,165
The big commercial building down by Sixth?

209
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:36,366
How bad?

210
00:08:36,368 --> 00:08:38,535
Took out the law firm and
the basement beneath it.

211
00:08:38,537 --> 00:08:39,870
Six folks in intensive care.

212
00:08:39,872 --> 00:08:41,004
Can we tag along?

213
00:08:41,006 --> 00:08:43,240
Merrick has you on ice.

214
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,647
One Wilton.

215
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:51,848
One Wilton.

216
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:57,253
They may have a problem a lot
bigger than a lawyer's office.

217
00:09:07,832 --> 00:09:09,265
So, it was a big blast,

218
00:09:09,267 --> 00:09:11,167
but they weren't trying
to take out the building.

219
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:12,335
Just the law firm.

220
00:09:12,524 --> 00:09:15,015
Mark Brown, Family Law.

221
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:18,374
Pretty drastic step to
settle a custody dispute.

222
00:09:18,376 --> 00:09:20,910
LAPD said the lawyer
found a note on his door.

223
00:09:20,912 --> 00:09:23,012
“You ruined my life, hope I ruined yours.”

224
00:09:23,014 --> 00:09:24,080
Who's that?

225
00:09:24,082 --> 00:09:25,548
Said he's assessing collateral damage...

226
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,716
Thank you.

227
00:09:26,718 --> 00:09:29,052
The destroyed Internet
equipment in the basement.

228
00:09:29,054 --> 00:09:30,360
Showed me an FSG badge.

229
00:09:30,386 --> 00:09:31,886
I've never seen one before.

230
00:09:33,424 --> 00:09:35,358
Cabe Gallo, Homeland Security.

231
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,293
Agent Thomas Keeler. FSG.

232
00:09:37,295 --> 00:09:39,562
Didn't know you guys
operated out in the open.

233
00:09:39,564 --> 00:09:40,897
Doesn't your jurisdiction only cover

234
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:42,598
online communications and surveillance?

235
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,866
And when the internet goes down,

236
00:09:43,868 --> 00:09:45,535
we'd like it back up and running ASAP.

237
00:09:45,537 --> 00:09:47,236
Cabe.

238
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:48,638
Who's contaminating my crime scene?

239
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,873
I think this is an act of terrorism.

240
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:51,908
Friends of yours?

241
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,743
Independent contractors.

242
00:09:54,746 --> 00:09:56,646
Excuse me.

243
00:09:56,648 --> 00:09:58,414
Why are you here?

244
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,783
That's Agent Thomas Keeler,

245
00:10:00,785 --> 00:10:02,084
Federal Surveillance Group.

246
00:10:02,086 --> 00:10:04,954
They analyze all domestic
data and communications

247
00:10:04,956 --> 00:10:07,436
- for security purposes.
- That's unconstitutional.

248
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,260
Their agency has a direct line to Merrick,
the Joint Chiefs,

249
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:12,728
the President.

250
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,330
Any of them hear shouting about terrorism...

251
00:10:14,332 --> 00:10:17,166
This intentionally nondescript building

252
00:10:17,168 --> 00:10:20,402
houses the hard cables that
support Internet service

253
00:10:20,404 --> 00:10:21,770
throughout the Southwest.

254
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:23,272
That right there is what's left of them.

255
00:10:23,274 --> 00:10:24,974
There was a note left on the lawyer's door.

256
00:10:24,976 --> 00:10:26,442
That was a decoy.

257
00:10:26,444 --> 00:10:29,044
If the bomber was targeting the
lawyer over something emotional,

258
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,446
divorce or child custody,

259
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:32,381
the killing mechanism
would have been intimate...

260
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:34,249
stabbing or strangulation.

261
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:37,019
Structurally, you'd put the
explosive in that light fixture.

262
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:39,154
Take the whole office out
instead of just a section.

263
00:10:39,156 --> 00:10:41,123
Whoever did this had to know that there was

264
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,025
a seven-millimeter fiber trunk cable

265
00:10:43,027 --> 00:10:45,627
in the air vent so they
could wedge a bomb behind.

266
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:47,563
That's the vent configuration
if everything is up to code.

267
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:49,631
Normally, there's no place to
even plant an explosive.

268
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:51,500
I worked in the Building Commission

269
00:10:51,502 --> 00:10:53,235
for a day until I got fired

270
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:55,838
for spilling some hand
sanitizer on some blueprints.

271
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,739
With the Web down

272
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,108
between here and Scottsdale, everything,

273
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,111
from banking to emergency
services is affected.

274
00:11:03,113 --> 00:11:04,313
No access to cash.

275
00:11:04,315 --> 00:11:06,848
Traffic will grind to a standstill by night.

276
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,751
Even the DWP runs online,
and in less than a week,

277
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,019
fresh water goes away.

278
00:11:11,021 --> 00:11:13,588
This is about more than
just people losing e-mail.

279
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,890
He's right about that.

280
00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:16,091
If you let us help,

281
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,692
we can eventually

282
00:11:17,694 --> 00:11:18,860
restore full service.

283
00:11:18,862 --> 00:11:19,961
In the meantime,

284
00:11:19,963 --> 00:11:21,596
we can help catch this bomber.

285
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:25,476
Who exactly are these independent
contractors of yours?

286
00:11:25,502 --> 00:11:29,013
They're a team of high-IQ personnel
that I've been working with.

287
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:31,940
Give me a second.

288
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:35,410
You're trying to make up
for blowing it earlier,

289
00:11:35,412 --> 00:11:37,512
but you guys are still brand-new at this.

290
00:11:37,514 --> 00:11:39,981
You screw it up like you did this morning,

291
00:11:39,983 --> 00:11:42,951
it's over for all of us.

292
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,085
You.

293
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:45,854
You need to keep these guys in check.

294
00:11:45,856 --> 00:11:47,022
That's your job.

295
00:11:47,024 --> 00:11:49,190
Capisce?

296
00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:54,142
Be determined to have 
a great day, and you will.

www.addic7ed.com

298
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:13,171
The bomb in downtown LA

299
00:12:13,197 --> 00:12:15,064
continues to have ripple effects.

300
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:17,901
Jerry Dowdell reports live
from Olympic and La Brea.

301
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,969
Security footage almost set up.

302
00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:21,971
All right, well, if that's the best
you can do, we'll take it.

303
00:12:21,973 --> 00:12:24,707
Happy, a 2000 Series Aggregation Router

304
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:26,676
is being overnighted from Berlin.

305
00:12:26,678 --> 00:12:28,177
Can we get it sooner?

306
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:29,779
We're not buying a mouse pad.

307
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:32,048
No, it's high-end product
only made in Germany.

308
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,650
So we get it installed tomorrow.

309
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,952
Internet's up; everything is back to normal.

310
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:37,553
Far from it in the meantime.

311
00:12:37,555 --> 00:12:39,455
Traffic lights are not working,

312
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:41,324
causing near gridlock.

313
00:12:41,326 --> 00:12:44,494
And now reports of a
train crossing malfunction

314
00:12:44,496 --> 00:12:47,296
in Moore Park that's resulted
in the death of two pedestrians.

315
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:48,498
Agent Gallo,

316
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,333
I have a psychotic bomber to catch,

317
00:12:50,335 --> 00:12:51,634
and I don't have all day.

318
00:12:51,636 --> 00:12:53,102
Surveillance footage is ready.

319
00:12:53,104 --> 00:12:54,537
All right, Happy, can you run

320
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:56,205
the films simultaneously?

321
00:12:56,207 --> 00:12:57,543
So, first thing

322
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,710
we're gonna do is run a
Gaussian filter algorithm.

323
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:03,337
That way, you get rid of all the
film where nothing moves.

324
00:13:03,363 --> 00:13:05,691
It's a big problem with
surveillance footage.

325
00:13:05,717 --> 00:13:10,028
There. We just cut down the number
of hours to search by 80%.

326
00:13:10,054 --> 00:13:11,554
Where did you get this “Goss-ian...”

327
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:12,788
Gaussian.

328
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,761
Gaussian algorithm thing?

329
00:13:15,787 --> 00:13:17,993
Photoshop. Toby, you're up.

330
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:19,597
We're gonna get a little un-PC up in here.

331
00:13:19,897 --> 00:13:21,864
Traditional bomber profile means we lose

332
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:23,065
Asians

333
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:24,366
and Latinos.

334
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:26,335
Cut anyone over 60 and under 12.

335
00:13:26,337 --> 00:13:28,771
That's not how this software
is meant to operate.

336
00:13:28,773 --> 00:13:30,206
Explosives are traditionally a boys' club,

337
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,740
so let's lose the women

338
00:13:31,742 --> 00:13:34,777
and anyone not wearing a hat or sunglasses.

339
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:37,379
All right, now who's ready 
for a little hustle and flow?

340
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:38,380
What's that?

341
00:13:38,382 --> 00:13:39,748
Flow dynamics, study of herd think.

342
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,116
Actions, reactions.

343
00:13:41,118 --> 00:13:42,951
When one gazelle's ears perk up,
so do all the others,

344
00:13:42,953 --> 00:13:44,086
then they all run from the cheetah

345
00:13:44,088 --> 00:13:45,287
with the same urgency.

346
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:46,288
But... ah!

347
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,258
That guy in the hat and sunglasses.

348
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,459
White male, 30s,

349
00:13:50,461 --> 00:13:52,060
fits the domestic terrorist M.O.

350
00:13:52,062 --> 00:13:54,530
See, he's calm, 'cause he knows
no other bombs are gonna go off.

351
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:56,265
Run him through the program.

352
00:13:56,267 --> 00:13:58,834
I did. It's no match.

353
00:13:58,836 --> 00:14:01,236
Well, we'll take it back to the FSG lab.

354
00:14:01,238 --> 00:14:03,615
We can clarify the photo.

355
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:05,440
You know, your software is decent,

356
00:14:05,442 --> 00:14:06,675
but it relies on three-point

357
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:08,043
bone structure ratio,

358
00:14:08,045 --> 00:14:09,711
and that's pretty hard to compute

359
00:14:09,713 --> 00:14:11,279
when half of someone's face is covered.

360
00:14:11,281 --> 00:14:14,282
How do you know so much about
top-secret government software?

361
00:14:14,284 --> 00:14:16,885
I may know someone who hacked into it.

362
00:14:16,887 --> 00:14:18,420
Be that as it may,

363
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:20,722
I'll rely on my technology.

364
00:14:21,811 --> 00:14:24,159
Cabe, let's go,

365
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:25,727
but I'm done with your friends.

366
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:28,296
Pump your brakes before you
say something brilliant.

367
00:14:28,298 --> 00:14:30,221
The truth is

368
00:14:30,247 --> 00:14:31,911
his $80 million software

369
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:35,237
was beaten by a hat and sunglasses.

370
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:37,606
What did we say earlier
about a chain of command?

371
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:39,307
You need to follow it.

372
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:40,642
Okay.

373
00:14:42,945 --> 00:14:44,713
This is illogical.

374
00:14:44,715 --> 00:14:46,848
We have a much better chance
of finding that bomber

375
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,049
than Cabe does.

376
00:14:48,051 --> 00:14:49,084
Okay, let's go.

377
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:50,685
That's not what Cabe wants.

378
00:14:50,687 --> 00:14:52,921
All right, the bottom line is

379
00:14:52,923 --> 00:14:54,656
Cabe wants this team to work,

380
00:14:54,658 --> 00:14:56,558
so if we find the guy that
everyone's looking for,

381
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,625
we won't ever have to worry

382
00:14:57,627 --> 00:14:58,993
about Director Merrick
shutting us down again.

383
00:14:58,995 --> 00:15:00,495
All right?

384
00:15:00,497 --> 00:15:02,697
All right.

385
00:15:04,867 --> 00:15:08,203
The bomber could have had
a car waiting for him,

386
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:11,005
but a co-conspirator,
it increases the odds of capture.

387
00:15:11,007 --> 00:15:12,540
Now there's a bus stop a street over,

388
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:14,509
but that gives people too
much time to see his face.

389
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:17,812
The plaza was full of people fleeing.

390
00:15:17,814 --> 00:15:20,748
I mean, it was far too crowded
for anybody to even get through.

391
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,816
Is he right about this?

392
00:15:21,818 --> 00:15:24,352
Normal mathematicians run probabilities,

393
00:15:24,354 --> 00:15:26,487
the odds of a given set
of facts taking place.

394
00:15:26,489 --> 00:15:29,824
Sylvester's mind runs all
potentialities, the odds

395
00:15:29,826 --> 00:15:31,626
of almost any possible
scenario taking place.

396
00:15:31,628 --> 00:15:32,727
That's incredible.

397
00:15:32,729 --> 00:15:34,595
- That's Sylvester. 
- That's Sylvester.

398
00:15:34,597 --> 00:15:36,063
Bargain Nation. Okay, so,

399
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:37,632
he enters in the chaos.

400
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:38,799
He walks to the back,

401
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:40,468
and he exits out the loading dock.

402
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,904
Now he's three blocks away
with little public exposure.

403
00:15:42,906 --> 00:15:44,205
That is his best play.

404
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:45,740
That's why we don't wait for Cabe.

405
00:15:45,742 --> 00:15:47,475
All right, we're gonna do this ourselves.

406
00:15:47,477 --> 00:15:49,176
Those stores take great close-ups

407
00:15:49,178 --> 00:15:50,544
when you go in to prevent shoplifters.

408
00:15:50,546 --> 00:15:51,712
They'll have him on camera.

409
00:15:51,714 --> 00:15:53,648
Why would they give us a photo?

410
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,915
Because I lifted Cabe's badge.

411
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:56,283
- Oh, Toby. 
- Oh, please.

412
00:15:56,285 --> 00:15:57,885
The way you two were fighting this morning,

413
00:15:57,887 --> 00:15:59,720
I figured we would have
gone rogue hours ago.

414
00:15:59,722 --> 00:16:03,100
You should thank me for anticipating.

415
00:16:03,126 --> 00:16:05,126
Now we have a close-up of our bomber.

416
00:16:05,128 --> 00:16:06,861
That's still doesn't help us.

417
00:16:06,863 --> 00:16:08,662
Hold on.

418
00:16:08,664 --> 00:16:10,664
Hey, dude, are you done with that?

419
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,133
Okay, you look pretty done with that. Whoa!

420
00:16:13,135 --> 00:16:15,269
Give me the photo.

421
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:17,271
This guy's got something to offer.

422
00:16:17,273 --> 00:16:18,606
Lens effect.

423
00:16:18,608 --> 00:16:20,641
Convex bottle and water to refract.

424
00:16:20,643 --> 00:16:23,844
His key chain's a bottle
opener with something on it.

425
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:26,747
Is that a turtle in a racing helmet?

426
00:16:26,749 --> 00:16:27,948
That's McAdoo's Tavern.

427
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,616
They have turtle races on Saturday nights.

428
00:16:29,618 --> 00:16:30,718
I lost four grand there.

429
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,019
Word to the wise,

430
00:16:32,021 --> 00:16:33,420
don't bet on Yertle McQuickShell.

431
00:16:33,422 --> 00:16:35,589
She's misnamed.

432
00:16:36,424 --> 00:16:37,691
What?

433
00:16:48,642 --> 00:16:49,976
Hey.

434
00:16:50,002 --> 00:16:51,848
We're, uh, looking for someone

435
00:16:51,874 --> 00:16:53,573
who might be one of your customers.

436
00:16:53,575 --> 00:16:54,708
You know the guy?

437
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,443
My shifts vary.

438
00:16:56,445 --> 00:16:57,511
I'm in and out.

439
00:16:57,513 --> 00:16:59,046
I don't really know a lot of the regulars.

440
00:16:59,048 --> 00:17:01,081
Really? Because you stop cutting
lemon wedges when you answered.

441
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,249
You want to know why?

442
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:03,550
Because I had enough?

443
00:17:03,552 --> 00:17:05,786
No, that's clearly not enough lemon wedges.

444
00:17:05,788 --> 00:17:06,887
You stopped because the part

445
00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:08,155
of your brain that handles the details

446
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:10,323
of small tasks like cutting lemon wedges

447
00:17:10,325 --> 00:17:12,159
also engages when someone's creating lies.

448
00:17:12,161 --> 00:17:14,060
“I'm in and out.
My shifts vary,” and so on.

449
00:17:14,062 --> 00:17:16,563
I'm assuming you're lying
because you're on parole

450
00:17:16,565 --> 00:17:18,498
like the majority of bartenders
working the day shift.

451
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,600
Your no-snitching criminal
code is only gonna result

452
00:17:20,602 --> 00:17:21,668
in trouble that you don't want.

453
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,236
So why don't you answer our questions?

454
00:17:23,238 --> 00:17:25,638
Hey, aren't you the guy who
lost a fortune on that turtle?

455
00:17:27,141 --> 00:17:30,052
What I do when I'm off-duty is my business.

456
00:17:30,078 --> 00:17:31,678
The fact that you're lying
means you know this guy

457
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,151
or where in town he might lay his head.

458
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,881
So go grab a pen and write it down,

459
00:17:34,883 --> 00:17:36,483
or the next thing I'm
gonna pull out of my hat

460
00:17:36,485 --> 00:17:38,218
is gonna be my cuffs. You got it, dish rag?

461
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,505
I know a waitress he took home one night.

462
00:17:40,531 --> 00:17:42,331
I'll make a call.

463
00:17:42,357 --> 00:17:43,890
You know you're not a cop.

464
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:47,217
You're a cop if you believe you're a cop.

465
00:17:49,163 --> 00:17:51,998
<i>Something's bothering you.</i>

466
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,568
Yes, Walter, we're outside the
house of a possible terrorist.

467
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,103
You guys might not be the best people

468
00:17:57,105 --> 00:17:58,371
to handle a situation like this.

469
00:17:58,373 --> 00:18:00,239
And if I'm going to
translate situations for you

470
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:01,574
like you asked me to,

471
00:18:01,576 --> 00:18:03,209
I think you're making a huge mistake.

472
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:04,477
You want me to call Cabe.

473
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:06,479
I will do it for sure when
we know the guy's in there.

474
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:08,858
Hold on a second.

475
00:18:08,983 --> 00:18:12,285
I have a way to find out if he's in there.

476
00:18:12,287 --> 00:18:13,352
Oh!

477
00:18:13,354 --> 00:18:14,954
Oh, I like this idea.

478
00:18:14,956 --> 00:18:15,922
Be right back!

479
00:18:15,924 --> 00:18:17,623
- That's my money.
- Yes?

480
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,959
Hi, Ralph. How are you, sweetie?

481
00:18:19,961 --> 00:18:22,195
Yeah, okay, I know there's no Internet,

482
00:18:22,197 --> 00:18:25,831
but maybe spend recess outside
and play with the other kids.

483
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,533
Can you give me the phone, please?

484
00:18:27,535 --> 00:18:30,369
Ralph occupy yourself with this.

485
00:18:30,371 --> 00:18:32,238
I have a riddle for you to figure out.

486
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,907
You can tell your mom the
answer at the end of the day.

487
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:36,842
So, what kind of punch

488
00:18:36,844 --> 00:18:38,044
does a jellyfish like?

489
00:18:38,046 --> 00:18:39,278
You got it? Okay, cool.

490
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,580
All right, hold on one second.
Any dreams you have

491
00:18:41,582 --> 00:18:44,550
of him making a team or
being in student council,

492
00:18:44,552 --> 00:18:46,886
it's just, uh, not gonna happen.

493
00:18:46,888 --> 00:18:49,655
I thought you told me
he'd eventually fit in.

494
00:18:49,657 --> 00:18:50,828
No, he will, just not at school.

495
00:18:50,854 --> 00:18:53,058
Ralph? Excuse me.

496
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,227
Hey.

497
00:18:56,663 --> 00:18:58,597
She's very sweet.
I know you think she can help,

498
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:00,299
but purely from an analytical point of view,

499
00:19:00,301 --> 00:19:01,533
what exactly is her purpose here?

500
00:19:01,535 --> 00:19:02,601
Oh, take it easy.

501
00:19:02,603 --> 00:19:04,270
Sylvester, come on, help me out here.

502
00:19:04,272 --> 00:19:06,438
She's pretty.

503
00:19:07,717 --> 00:19:10,552
Do I need to remind you guys that

504
00:19:10,578 --> 00:19:11,777
when I found Happy, she was paying people

505
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:13,746
to be her stand-in at
fabrication competitions

506
00:19:13,748 --> 00:19:15,080
because she can't stand to be judged?

507
00:19:15,082 --> 00:19:17,216
When I first met you,

508
00:19:17,218 --> 00:19:20,152
you were about to get beaten
by an Atlantic City pit boss,

509
00:19:20,154 --> 00:19:22,888
and do we even need to discuss
the state that you were in?

510
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,223
It wasn't pleasant.

511
00:19:24,225 --> 00:19:26,225
I-I saw something in you guys.

512
00:19:26,227 --> 00:19:27,426
I see something in her.

513
00:19:27,428 --> 00:19:29,394
She'll thrive at this job.

514
00:19:29,396 --> 00:19:30,996
You just, you have to trust me.

515
00:19:30,998 --> 00:19:32,231
Hold this.

516
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:33,632
I need a parabola.

517
00:19:33,634 --> 00:19:35,500
Give me that tape!

518
00:19:35,502 --> 00:19:37,035
That's the only thing

519
00:19:37,037 --> 00:19:38,937
holding my seat together. I need the mic.

520
00:19:38,939 --> 00:19:40,339
Here.

521
00:19:42,476 --> 00:19:44,276
This umbrella is disgusting.

522
00:19:44,278 --> 00:19:46,912
Okay, everyone quiet.

523
00:19:49,949 --> 00:19:51,316
Footsteps.

524
00:19:51,318 --> 00:19:52,751
Walter, you really need to call Cabe.

525
00:19:55,732 --> 00:19:57,366
Hold on.

526
00:19:57,891 --> 00:19:59,958
I think it's him.

527
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,027
Be cool, guys.

528
00:20:11,137 --> 00:20:12,604
- Come on! 
- Oh! Happy, Happy!

529
00:20:12,606 --> 00:20:13,938
We can nail this guy! Happy, Happy!

530
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,173
Happy!

531
00:20:15,175 --> 00:20:17,342
You do a loop around the
block and make sure that he

532
00:20:17,344 --> 00:20:18,943
doesn't come under the bridge.
Paige, get in with me now.

533
00:20:18,945 --> 00:20:20,078
Chasing bad guys

534
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,414
- isn't out thing.
-  It is now!

535
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,315
No one will ever know if
we just don't do anything.

536
00:20:24,317 --> 00:20:26,084
Goddamn it.

537
00:20:30,222 --> 00:20:33,124
I'm right on your six,
you dumb son of a bitch!

538
00:20:35,728 --> 00:20:38,263
There he is. We got him.

539
00:20:38,265 --> 00:20:40,498
Walter, it's a dead end.

540
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,733
Dead end!

541
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:53,010
Halt! Stop!

542
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:02,693
There he is!

543
00:21:03,355 --> 00:21:04,622
Oh, my God! He's got a gun!

544
00:21:04,624 --> 00:21:06,190
Aah!
Get down, get down, get down! Aah!

545
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:16,708
Oh... oh, no...

546
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:19,665
Not good.

547
00:21:37,525 --> 00:21:38,859
Blown pupil.

548
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:42,639
Spinal fluid coming out of
his nose. Comatose.

549
00:21:42,665 --> 00:21:44,998
Well, the good news is we found the guy.

550
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,560
Really?

551
00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:49,369
Is that good news?

552
00:21:49,371 --> 00:21:52,239
'Cause I thought we might want
to question our only witness,

553
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:54,274
find out his agenda.

554
00:21:54,276 --> 00:21:55,976
Where some more bombs might be.

555
00:21:55,978 --> 00:22:00,447
But we can't do that when
the guy's in a damn coma.

556
00:22:00,449 --> 00:22:02,516
Great job, Mensa.

557
00:22:02,518 --> 00:22:03,750
Mensa?! Please.

558
00:22:03,752 --> 00:22:05,519
There are porn stars in Mensa.

559
00:22:05,521 --> 00:22:07,487
I will write all of you up

560
00:22:07,489 --> 00:22:10,523
for hindering a Federal investigation.

561
00:22:10,525 --> 00:22:14,060
You hitched your wagon to
some real stars, here, Gallo.

562
00:22:17,732 --> 00:22:19,532
Thank you, Toby.

563
00:22:19,534 --> 00:22:20,633
Hey...

564
00:22:20,635 --> 00:22:22,168
Where the hell do you think you're going?

565
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:24,104
You're going to the suspect's
house to gather evidence,

566
00:22:24,106 --> 00:22:25,171
I can help you.

567
00:22:25,173 --> 00:22:27,841
If I want your help, I'll ask you for it.

568
00:22:41,422 --> 00:22:43,356
You have the same look Ralph does

569
00:22:43,358 --> 00:22:45,024
when he can't figure something out.

570
00:22:45,026 --> 00:22:47,226
Right. All I know is that...

571
00:22:47,228 --> 00:22:50,496
if the only suspect dies,
and we don't get

572
00:22:50,498 --> 00:22:51,964
the whole story on what's going on,

573
00:22:51,966 --> 00:22:55,902
then more people could get hurt
and that would be our fault.

574
00:22:58,139 --> 00:23:00,706
I don't think this experiment
with Cabe survives,

575
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:02,008
and we need this.

576
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:05,344
The mentally-enabled don't
find a home this easily.

577
00:23:05,346 --> 00:23:07,547
It's safe for us here, you know?

578
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:10,883
I overheard you and the guys
talking about me earlier...

579
00:23:10,885 --> 00:23:13,286
Oh, they-they didn't mean anything by it.

580
00:23:13,288 --> 00:23:16,088
I don't think you guys
say things you don't mean.

581
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,391
But I quit a job to be here.

582
00:23:18,393 --> 00:23:21,560
I have a kid and bills and no other options.

583
00:23:21,562 --> 00:23:24,563
Now, I heard you tell them that
you believe in me... well...

584
00:23:24,565 --> 00:23:28,134
I believe in you, too,
but you guys don't listen.

585
00:23:29,336 --> 00:23:30,636
You think you're always right

586
00:23:30,638 --> 00:23:32,104
because you are almost always right,

587
00:23:32,106 --> 00:23:33,572
but if you keep boxing me out,

588
00:23:33,574 --> 00:23:37,352
like the cool kids on the playground,
then... you're correct...

589
00:23:37,378 --> 00:23:40,079
this won't survive.

590
00:23:56,963 --> 00:23:58,572
Would it buy them any good will

591
00:23:58,598 --> 00:24:00,566
if I told you they know they screwed up?

592
00:24:00,568 --> 00:24:02,201
Barely.

593
00:24:03,903 --> 00:24:06,472
Bits and pieces from the guy's garage.

594
00:24:06,474 --> 00:24:08,373
- Assume it's IEDs.
- I'll take a look.

595
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:10,042
Need a hand.

596
00:24:11,511 --> 00:24:13,445
Bomber's computer.

597
00:24:13,447 --> 00:24:16,381
It has some kind of security setup.

598
00:24:16,383 --> 00:24:18,250
The only reason we're
getting a shot at this,

599
00:24:18,252 --> 00:24:20,452
is 'cause Keeler's men couldn't
get through the firewall.

600
00:24:20,454 --> 00:24:21,853
And it's important we do,

601
00:24:21,855 --> 00:24:23,589
because the guy's fingerprints
aren't in the system,

602
00:24:23,591 --> 00:24:25,857
and all five of his
aliases have come up empty.

603
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:27,559
All right, I'll get into it.

604
00:24:35,903 --> 00:24:37,335
Craftsmanship on the wiring

605
00:24:37,337 --> 00:24:39,771
indicates U.S. Special Forces training.

606
00:24:39,773 --> 00:24:42,307
But there's only one reason
to have these other pieces.

607
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:46,811
And these things here...
are leftover sequencers.

608
00:24:46,813 --> 00:24:50,815
But they were all set for some
time within the half hour,

609
00:24:50,817 --> 00:24:53,852
all coordinated via local
frequency transmitters.

610
00:24:53,854 --> 00:24:56,121
And what does that mean?

611
00:24:56,123 --> 00:24:57,322
There are more bombs.

612
00:24:57,324 --> 00:24:59,024
But they were all supposed to go off

613
00:24:59,026 --> 00:25:00,458
in LA at the same time.

614
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,361
I think the bomb at One Wilton malfunctioned

615
00:25:03,363 --> 00:25:04,929
and went off early, and more bombs

616
00:25:04,931 --> 00:25:06,531
are coming down the pike real soon.

617
00:25:06,533 --> 00:25:08,533
You think or you know?

618
00:25:11,505 --> 00:25:12,737
I know.

619
00:25:39,713 --> 00:25:43,307
He hit a mall,
a radio tower and an armored car.

620
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,177
I don't get it.

621
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:45,576
What he's doing is random.
It makes no sense.

622
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:46,744
- Um, guys...
- I've been to every one of these sights,

623
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:48,579
and I still don't see a pattern.

624
00:25:48,581 --> 00:25:50,815
- Guys, maybe it isn't meant...
- See, it's terrorism without focus,

625
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:52,483
- and that's not how these guys work.
- Hey, I'm talking.

626
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:56,045
- We're trying to figure something out.
- Don't interrupt me, Toby.

627
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:58,482
The armored truck wasn't the target.

628
00:25:58,508 --> 00:26:00,324
I was a cashier at a Pic 'N Save.

629
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:02,193
When the truck shows up depends on how much

630
00:26:02,195 --> 00:26:04,028
extra cash double-coupon
Wednesdays brings in.

631
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,863
So it shows up at different times each week.

632
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:07,231
There's no way to plan bombing something

633
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,899
if you don't know when it'll be there.

634
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,268
So maybe he put the bomb in the garbage can

635
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,704
to take out that building, not the truck.

636
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,774
She might be right.

637
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,810
Remember when I said you'd thrive?

638
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:22,513
Feels good being right again.

639
00:26:22,515 --> 00:26:24,148
So if the building was a target,

640
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,216
the next logical question is “why?”

641
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:28,485
Well, it has to be some business
in that building, right?

642
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:29,786
I'm gonna call Information.

643
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:30,821
That's a good idea.

644
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:32,122
Oh, afterwards, let's write on

645
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:33,257
one of those zeppelins I've heard about.

646
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,158
Yeah, hi.

647
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,229
My name is Federal agent Cabe Gallo,
badge number 2835.

648
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:40,397
I want to get a rundown

649
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:43,166
on all the numbers running from 939 Conklin.

650
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:45,168
Thank you.

651
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:50,327
Before computers, people had
to actually talk to each other.

652
00:26:51,442 --> 00:26:53,643
Yeah, I'm ready.

653
00:26:54,227 --> 00:26:56,413
Casperson Film and Print.

654
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:59,516
Lynchfield Printing... Greytech.

655
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:02,486
- Greytech... that's it. That's it.
- Thank you for your help.

656
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:04,947
Greytech specialize in slow storage servers,

657
00:27:04,973 --> 00:27:07,991
places that hold old data
that's rarely accessed on-line,

658
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:10,594
like, uh... five-year- old
bank statements...

659
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:13,263
So he bombed the Internet hub
and then a slow server but...

660
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:14,798
that doesn't explain the other targets.

661
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,366
They're red herrings.

662
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,335
The bomber wanted his attacks

663
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:20,136
to appear random, to hide his real motive.

664
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,171
But what is it?

665
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:23,306
He's taking out sites where...

666
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,041
data would be stored long-term

667
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:27,210
and the ability to distribute it on-line,

668
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,678
so maybe the bomber's got a secret

669
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,013
he doesn't want getting out

670
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,575
and he's willing to blow
up the city to erase it.

671
00:27:33,684 --> 00:27:36,386
There's an increasing
sense of panic in the city.

672
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:38,288
Traffic signals are still sporadic.

673
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,523
And now, overloading electrical transformers

674
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:42,759
have erupted into flames,

675
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:45,495
igniting several homes and a brush fire.

676
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,163
Director Merrick's all over my ass

677
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,725
because the damn city's falling apart.

678
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,801
I hope to God you're making progress

679
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:52,902
with the bomber's computer.

680
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,103
Oh, I am.

681
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:55,605
It shows a failed attempt

682
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,640
to hack into a file at a slow server.

683
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,675
Now, the file belonged to an e-mail account

684
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,344
by the name of Frank Turner.

685
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,279
Frank Turner died two weeks ago.

686
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,414
I printed out this article for you.

687
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,682
A hit and run?

688
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,017
More like “Hit and run”"

689
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,952
The car that actually killed
him was never even found.

690
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,854
But if someone is willing
to blow up buildings

691
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,089
to erase Frank Turner's files,

692
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:15,858
it has to contain something
very incriminating.

693
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,493
On someone very important.

694
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:19,228
But how in the hell do you erase a file

695
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,730
once it's on the Web?

696
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,732
Oh, it can be done.

697
00:28:24,368 --> 00:28:25,534
You got it, right?

698
00:28:25,536 --> 00:28:26,602
Right.

699
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:28,571
Okay. Yeah.

700
00:28:31,174 --> 00:28:35,311
First, you'd need to destroy
the means of distribution.

701
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,880
He did that when he blew up
the building this morning.

702
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,248
Next... you need to get rid

703
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,983
of where it's stored... the slow server.

704
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:43,452
He did that when he blew up Greytech.

705
00:28:43,454 --> 00:28:46,155
Now, if you want to get 
really anal about it,

706
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:48,290
- you take out the router hub.
- What's that?

707
00:28:48,292 --> 00:28:49,625
Most people don't know this,

708
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:51,093
but when you send a file on-line,

709
00:28:51,095 --> 00:28:52,695
it sits at a small router

710
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:55,230
before moving on to a slow sever.

711
00:28:55,232 --> 00:28:58,634
But even as it goes,
it leaves a copy of itself.

712
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:00,002
A shadow file.

713
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,370
And that remains for a few weeks,

714
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:03,138
and then...  disappears.

715
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,209
Now, the problem is there's
thousands of router hubs,

716
00:29:07,211 --> 00:29:09,778
but millions of files going in.

717
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,548
So we're tracing Frank Turner's IP address,

718
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,317
trying to track down the right router hub.

719
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:17,637
It's like looking for
a needle in a haystack.

720
00:29:17,663 --> 00:29:19,721
I got it. And it's actually

721
00:29:19,723 --> 00:29:22,658
more like trying to find a
needle in a pile of needles.

722
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,293
Ladies and gentlemen,

723
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:25,294
who wants to sew?

724
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:27,195
Because I just found that needle.

725
00:29:27,197 --> 00:29:28,797
Frank Turner's IP address leads

726
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,699
to a router hub in sunny Tarzana.

727
00:29:30,701 --> 00:29:31,700
Come on, follow me.

728
00:29:31,702 --> 00:29:33,068
I just saved a whole bunch of people.

729
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,536
We find what's in that e-mail,

730
00:29:34,538 --> 00:29:37,098
we'll know who wants to destroy it.

731
00:29:42,979 --> 00:29:45,614
Exactly what are you looking for?

732
00:29:45,616 --> 00:29:46,848
If we explained it to you,

733
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,283
your mind would melt into your socks.

734
00:29:48,285 --> 00:29:49,784
It's official government business.

735
00:29:49,786 --> 00:29:52,120
Just... give us some room.

736
00:29:53,756 --> 00:29:56,424
Normals, huh?

737
00:29:56,426 --> 00:29:57,892
No offense.

738
00:29:57,894 --> 00:29:59,027
None taken.

739
00:29:59,029 --> 00:30:00,061
Got it.

740
00:30:00,063 --> 00:30:03,932
E-mail from Frank Turner to 
a heavily encrypted account.

741
00:30:06,802 --> 00:30:08,636
Whoa.

742
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,272
All right, “My name is Frank Turner.

743
00:30:11,274 --> 00:30:13,775
I was a member of FSG...”

744
00:30:13,777 --> 00:30:15,710
The agency Agent Keeler's with.

745
00:30:15,712 --> 00:30:18,446
“In violation of
U.S. and international law,

746
00:30:18,448 --> 00:30:21,749
“FSG, under Agent Thomas Keeler

747
00:30:21,751 --> 00:30:23,518
“has been spying on the White House,

748
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,153
- the State Department..”" 
- Stop right there.

749
00:30:25,155 --> 00:30:27,422
So Keeler found out about this,
took Turner out,

750
00:30:27,424 --> 00:30:29,424
and then went after that data.

751
00:30:29,426 --> 00:30:31,526
Just copy it onto the drive.

752
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:34,362
I'll get it to the DOJ,
get a warrant to arrest Keeler.

753
00:30:34,364 --> 00:30:35,596
That son of a bitch.

754
00:30:35,598 --> 00:30:37,799
He brought you in just
to keep an eye on you.

755
00:30:37,801 --> 00:30:39,500
- Keeler hired the bomber? 
- A black ops ghost,

756
00:30:39,502 --> 00:30:41,269
who couldn't be traced back to him.

757
00:30:41,271 --> 00:30:43,171
Here's the file, Cabe.

758
00:30:43,173 --> 00:30:46,641
FSG's a black budget funded operation.

759
00:30:46,643 --> 00:30:49,243
They recruit out of the
CIA and the Special Forces.

760
00:30:49,245 --> 00:30:52,765
They're
plugged in with no oversight.

761
00:30:53,982 --> 00:30:56,560
- Happy, what are you doing?
- I just heard something.

762
00:30:56,586 --> 00:30:58,546
What are you...? Happy?

763
00:31:02,758 --> 00:31:04,558
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

764
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,693
- Oh, my God. 
- Where's she going?

765
00:31:05,695 --> 00:31:07,762
Hey, hey, hey... ...just be careful, okay?

766
00:31:07,764 --> 00:31:08,963
Where's she going?

767
00:31:26,781 --> 00:31:29,617
Guys, big problem.

768
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,990
It's mean-looking.

769
00:31:35,992 --> 00:31:37,558
Enough plastique for this building

770
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,892
and the one next door.

771
00:31:38,894 --> 00:31:41,228
Uh, based on the speed 
of the blinking light,

772
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,629
and the acceleration of the beep,

773
00:31:42,631 --> 00:31:44,598
I would say that we have approximately

774
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,166
five minutes and 31 seconds.

775
00:31:46,168 --> 00:31:48,702
I thought said there's no chance
he'd choose this building.

776
00:31:48,704 --> 00:31:50,104
He didn't.

777
00:31:50,106 --> 00:31:51,438
There are no sequencers on this device.

778
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,606
It was put here recently.

779
00:31:52,608 --> 00:31:54,374
Did someone tell Keeler
we were going to be here?

780
00:31:54,376 --> 00:31:56,009
I told Merrick.

781
00:31:56,011 --> 00:31:57,377
Yeah, who kept the FSG in the loop

782
00:31:57,379 --> 00:31:58,378
because he doesn't trust us.

783
00:31:59,648 --> 00:32:01,782
There's no time to call in the bomb squad.

784
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,419
All right, we're gonna have to
evacuate the building ourselves.

785
00:32:05,421 --> 00:32:08,364
Have the maintenance 
man pull the fire alarm.

786
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,423
That leaves the building 20% full.

787
00:32:09,425 --> 00:32:10,390
They'll think it's a drill.

788
00:32:10,392 --> 00:32:11,925
All right, then go floor to floor.

789
00:32:11,927 --> 00:32:14,437
- But just keep an eye on time, okay? 
- Uh-huh.

790
00:32:14,463 --> 00:32:16,163
Cabe, you gotta get that drive

791
00:32:16,165 --> 00:32:17,831
to the DOJ. If this place goes up,

792
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:19,700
it's the last existing version of the file.

793
00:32:19,702 --> 00:32:22,102
- Sylvester, make sure he knows how to open it.
- Happily.

794
00:32:22,104 --> 00:32:23,737
You're gonna need this to get into the DOJ.

795
00:32:23,739 --> 00:32:25,105
Where'd you get that?

796
00:32:25,107 --> 00:32:27,152
You dropped it.

797
00:32:36,151 --> 00:32:37,551
<i>Are there a lot of people</i>

798
00:32:37,553 --> 00:32:39,152
working for the government
like Agent Keeler?

799
00:32:39,154 --> 00:32:42,889
It makes it kind of hard to trust officials.

800
00:32:42,891 --> 00:32:44,624
He's a rarity.

801
00:32:44,626 --> 00:32:46,459
There's no sense going around

802
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:49,021
terrified that the government's after you.

803
00:33:08,016 --> 00:33:10,884
The file. Now.

804
00:33:25,988 --> 00:33:27,422
I'll put a hole in your head.

805
00:33:27,424 --> 00:33:28,723
You give me that file.

806
00:33:28,725 --> 00:33:30,525
Okay, you want to get smart, huh?

807
00:33:30,527 --> 00:33:32,294
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait wait.

808
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:46,241
Don't you move!

809
00:33:46,243 --> 00:33:47,976
<i>Everybody needs to exit!</i>

810
00:33:47,978 --> 00:33:50,145
- Guys, evacuate the building!
- This is not a drill!

811
00:33:50,147 --> 00:33:52,747
- Come on, go, go go!
- Everybody get out of the building, now.

812
00:33:52,749 --> 00:33:54,015
- Evacuate now! 
- Hey, you guys!

813
00:33:54,017 --> 00:33:55,450
- You need to run!
- This is not...

814
00:33:55,452 --> 00:33:57,418
I can't defuse this.

815
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:01,689
We're down to 3:40, 39, 38...

816
00:34:01,691 --> 00:34:02,857
This wiring is all jerry-rigged,

817
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:04,359
pure guerilla IED thinking.

818
00:34:04,361 --> 00:34:05,493
Anything could trip it.

819
00:34:05,495 --> 00:34:07,128
Well, if we don't run now, we're dead;

820
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,097
if we do run now,
everyone else left in the building is dead,

821
00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:10,999
- so... any ideas?
- If it were 1840,

822
00:34:11,001 --> 00:34:12,734
- we could drop it down a well.
- What about the roof?

823
00:34:12,736 --> 00:34:14,016
No time.

824
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,170
Wait!

825
00:34:16,172 --> 00:34:17,238
Janitor supplies.

826
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,440
Joint compound.

827
00:34:19,442 --> 00:34:20,708
This bomb's gonna blow,

828
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:23,211
but we can lessen the impact.

829
00:34:23,213 --> 00:34:25,246
If this, uh, janitor likes his grub salty,

830
00:34:25,248 --> 00:34:26,714
we might be able to mute the bomb.

831
00:34:26,716 --> 00:34:28,850
Salt speeds up the hardening process,

832
00:34:28,852 --> 00:34:30,718
- but you gotta mix it in thoroughly.
- Ah! Ha ha!

833
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,496
Salt packets! We're in business.

834
00:34:44,164 --> 00:34:46,367
Guys, hurry, hurry, hurry!

835
00:34:46,369 --> 00:34:47,768
Get out of the building!

836
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:50,471
Sir, get out of the building!

837
00:34:51,306 --> 00:34:52,706
Toby!

838
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:54,542
You're bleeding. You're bleeding.

839
00:34:54,544 --> 00:34:57,104
Oh, my God. We gotta go.

840
00:34:59,414 --> 00:35:00,548
If this works,

841
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,582
the blast will take out the garage,

842
00:35:01,584 --> 00:35:02,816
but save the building.

843
00:35:02,818 --> 00:35:06,453
Ah... we're down to a minute 30.

844
00:35:08,657 --> 00:35:10,157
Here we go.

845
00:35:12,628 --> 00:35:14,828
If the salt works,

846
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,664
it should harden pretty quick.

847
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:18,499
It'll mute the blast enough

848
00:35:18,501 --> 00:35:19,967
to contain damage to this garage.

849
00:35:19,969 --> 00:35:22,102
If it's not stirred until
it's hard as a rock,

850
00:35:22,104 --> 00:35:23,504
it won't mute anything.

851
00:35:23,506 --> 00:35:26,373
Happy, you gotta go find Paige and Toby.

852
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:27,741
Get 'em out of the building.

853
00:35:27,743 --> 00:35:28,842
You got about a minute left.

854
00:35:28,844 --> 00:35:30,144
I run when you do.

855
00:35:30,146 --> 00:35:31,845
Do it now, okay?

856
00:35:31,847 --> 00:35:34,014
I'm right behind you.

857
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,417
You better be.

858
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:58,505
We have seconds to get clear!

859
00:35:58,507 --> 00:36:00,707
One in front of the other, dimwit.

860
00:36:00,709 --> 00:36:02,242
In half a minute, this building goes.

861
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:03,376
Where's Walter?

862
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:06,304
He's coming. He promised.

863
00:36:22,663 --> 00:36:24,197
Cabe...

864
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,896
I don't want to shoot anyone,

865
00:36:56,898 --> 00:36:58,164
but I will if I have to!

866
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,066
And honestly, I don't know

867
00:37:00,068 --> 00:37:01,701
who I'd hit, so, so please...

868
00:37:01,703 --> 00:37:03,783
put the pipe down!

869
00:37:12,859 --> 00:37:14,193
He'll get out.

870
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:16,779
He knows the time left.

871
00:37:53,252 --> 00:37:54,619
Okay.

872
00:37:54,645 --> 00:37:57,356
I still don't know what it is,
exactly, you do here.

873
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,851
But... I'm glad you're here.

874
00:37:59,846 --> 00:38:02,013
You're welcome.

875
00:38:04,664 --> 00:38:07,132
You could've left him in
the building, you know.

876
00:38:07,134 --> 00:38:09,301
I'd be tempted.

877
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:12,337
Can you get anything from your computer?

878
00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:13,405
No, it's ruined.

879
00:38:13,407 --> 00:38:16,775
Blast destroyed and shredded the hard drive.

880
00:38:16,777 --> 00:38:18,810
Thumb drive is dust.

881
00:38:18,812 --> 00:38:20,345
So he erased all the evidence

882
00:38:20,347 --> 00:38:22,848
that could tie Keeler to these bombings.

883
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:25,183
He might be in custody now,

884
00:38:25,185 --> 00:38:27,129
but he'll be gone by morning.

885
00:38:27,155 --> 00:38:30,155
What if someone knew that on December 17

886
00:38:30,157 --> 00:38:32,457
Keeler and the U.S. Secretary of Defense

887
00:38:32,459 --> 00:38:35,927
had a meeting about illegal
drone strikes in Pakistan

888
00:38:35,929 --> 00:38:39,264
and Keeler recorded it to use as blackmail?

889
00:38:39,266 --> 00:38:41,867
I'd say it's admissible evidence.

890
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:43,468
What-what are you getting at, son?

891
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,870
Sylvester was standing over my shoulder

892
00:38:44,872 --> 00:38:46,976
when the unencrypted file scrolled through.

893
00:38:47,002 --> 00:38:48,907
He memorized the whole thing.

894
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,108
It was almost 30 pages, though.

895
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,910
It only took a second.

896
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:54,312
There are a lot of
incriminating things in there.

897
00:38:54,314 --> 00:38:56,147
Dirty things.

898
00:38:56,149 --> 00:38:57,882
You're coming with me to Homeland.

899
00:38:57,884 --> 00:38:59,918
We're getting what you know down on paper.

900
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,562
- Okay.
- We got Keeler.

901
00:39:01,616 --> 00:39:03,083
He's going away.

902
00:39:03,085 --> 00:39:04,684
Maybe Merrick'll back off a bit now.

903
00:39:04,686 --> 00:39:07,153
Cabe... what about, um...

904
00:39:07,155 --> 00:39:09,489
your doubts?

905
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:14,119
I want this to work.

906
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:17,130
I need it to work.

907
00:39:17,132 --> 00:39:20,466
I wasn't promoted to Los Angeles.

908
00:39:20,468 --> 00:39:23,965
I flamed out in New York,
after the Baghdad incident.

909
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:26,773
The thought of 2,000 civilians dying

910
00:39:26,775 --> 00:39:28,441
and me carrying the blame...

911
00:39:28,443 --> 00:39:31,110
I was a hair away from forced retirement

912
00:39:31,112 --> 00:39:34,791
when I came up with the idea
to try to make cases with you.

913
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,484
So you thought that we would be

914
00:39:38,486 --> 00:39:40,086
the jolt that<i> your</i> career needs?

915
00:39:40,088 --> 00:39:43,122
I want some blood off my ledger.

916
00:39:43,124 --> 00:39:45,458
So even though you may not trust me,

917
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,160
you should know

918
00:39:48,162 --> 00:39:51,597
that I trust you so much

919
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,500
that I've put everything
into this team and you.

920
00:40:05,145 --> 00:40:08,841
How would a normal person
react to what he just said?

921
00:40:10,051 --> 00:40:12,184
Say “thanks,”

922
00:40:12,186 --> 00:40:13,719
and you appreciate it.

923
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:18,757
Maybe next time.

924
00:40:18,759 --> 00:40:21,327
My glucose level is plummeting.

925
00:40:21,329 --> 00:40:23,851
I just called for a transport for Keeler.

926
00:40:23,877 --> 00:40:26,398
We'll stop and get you a burger
on the way to Homeland, hero.

927
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,911
- We'll all get food.
- I can't.

928
00:40:29,937 --> 00:40:32,771
I've got to pick up Ralph from aftercare.

929
00:40:32,773 --> 00:40:34,973
Well, we'll all go.

930
00:40:37,645 --> 00:40:39,719
- How was your day?
- Okay.

931
00:40:52,025 --> 00:40:53,058
Hey, Ralph.

932
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:57,572
So... what kind of punch
does a jellyfish like?

933
00:40:57,598 --> 00:40:58,563
A smack.

934
00:40:58,565 --> 00:40:59,865
Because a group of them is called

935
00:40:59,867 --> 00:41:01,333
a “Smack” of jellyfish.

936
00:41:01,335 --> 00:41:04,436
You know a bunch of turtles is a “bale”?

937
00:41:04,438 --> 00:41:05,671
Don't ever bet on them.

938
00:41:05,673 --> 00:41:07,606
Hippos hang out in a “bloat.”

939
00:41:07,608 --> 00:41:10,542
A pride of lions and a parliament of owls.

940
00:41:10,544 --> 00:41:12,010
Army of ants.

941
00:41:12,012 --> 00:41:13,478
You know, um...

942
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,914
what a family of scorpions is called?

943
00:41:15,916 --> 00:41:17,682
A cyclone.

944
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:20,986
Now, scorpions are very
loyal to their cyclone.

945
00:41:20,988 --> 00:41:22,587
But if one of them is attacked,

946
00:41:22,589 --> 00:41:24,723
all the others dive in.

947
00:41:24,725 --> 00:41:26,424
And we, all of us,

948
00:41:26,426 --> 00:41:28,226
we're a cyclone.

949
00:41:28,228 --> 00:41:29,461
This cyclone is hungry.

950
00:41:29,463 --> 00:41:31,229
Let's get some food!

951
00:41:31,231 --> 00:41:35,576
You know, eventually, uh, everyone fits in.

952
