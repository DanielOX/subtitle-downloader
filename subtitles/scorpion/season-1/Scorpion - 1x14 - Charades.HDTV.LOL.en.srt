1
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:07,750
<i>My name is Walter O'Brien.</i>

2
00:00:07,752 --> 00:00:12,121
<i>I have the fourth highest IQ</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

3
00:00:12,123 --> 00:00:13,789
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

4
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:16,458
<i>When I was 11, the FBI</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking NASA</i>

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,128
<i>to get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,363
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

7
00:00:21,365 --> 00:00:22,831
<i>tackling worldwide threats</i>

8
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,299
<i>only we can solve.</i>

9
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:26,035
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

10
00:00:26,037 --> 00:00:27,803
<i>Sylvester's a human calculator.</i>

11
00:00:27,805 --> 00:00:30,105
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

12
00:00:30,107 --> 00:00:32,374
<i>Agent Cabe Gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

13
00:00:32,376 --> 00:00:34,643
<i>And Paige?</i>
<i>Well, Paige isn't like us.</i>

14
00:00:34,645 --> 00:00:37,112
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

15
00:00:37,114 --> 00:00:39,782
<i>while we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

16
00:00:39,784 --> 00:00:41,884
<i>Together, we are Scorpion.</i>

17
00:00:44,655 --> 00:00:47,690
Now that this
has happened between us,

18
00:00:47,692 --> 00:00:50,893
we can't let it
confuse Ralph, you know?

19
00:00:52,663 --> 00:00:56,598
Uh, you coming into Ralph's life
has been so important to him.

20
00:00:58,469 --> 00:00:59,935
You know what I'm saying, Drew?

21
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:06,275
Walter.

22
00:01:06,277 --> 00:01:07,743
What are you doing here?

23
00:01:07,745 --> 00:01:09,344
You know why I'm here.

24
00:01:09,346 --> 00:01:10,913
Because you've been
thinking about me.

25
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,551
What the hell?

26
00:01:18,022 --> 00:01:19,555
Book.

27
00:01:19,557 --> 00:01:20,756
Three words.

28
00:01:20,758 --> 00:01:21,724
Dead Sea Scrolls.

29
00:01:21,726 --> 00:01:23,559
Darn it, I knew
it'd be too easy.

30
00:01:25,062 --> 00:01:26,062
Morning.

31
00:01:26,063 --> 00:01:28,197
You look frazzled.
Thank you.

32
00:01:28,199 --> 00:01:29,932
Grumpy, too.

33
00:01:29,934 --> 00:01:32,267
Sorry, I didn't sleep.

34
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:33,635
I had a weird dream.

35
00:01:33,637 --> 00:01:35,037
About what?

36
00:01:36,207 --> 00:01:38,474
I don't remember the details.

37
00:01:38,476 --> 00:01:39,508
That's unsurprising.

38
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,111
Our brains often
protect us

39
00:01:42,113 --> 00:01:43,078
from disturbing dreams

40
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,747
by suppressing
our memories of them.

41
00:01:44,749 --> 00:01:47,816
What does it mean when
you remember a dream vividly?

42
00:01:47,818 --> 00:01:49,718
Means that we enjoyed it.

43
00:01:51,222 --> 00:01:52,908
Hey, relax, you can play
charades with us--

44
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:53,506
it'll be fun.

45
00:01:53,507 --> 00:01:56,174
Playing charades
with geniuses is never fun.

46
00:01:56,176 --> 00:01:58,042
Come on, we need
fresh blood.

47
00:01:58,044 --> 00:02:00,578
Okay.

48
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,946
Movie.

49
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:04,916
Three words.

50
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:06,251
<i>Sleepless in Seattle.</i>

51
00:02:06,253 --> 00:02:07,218
See what I mean?

52
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,354
Cabe, charades.

53
00:02:09,356 --> 00:02:11,022
I told you never again.

54
00:02:11,024 --> 00:02:13,424
Besides, we got a case.

55
00:02:13,426 --> 00:02:15,693
And this one's not
from Homeland.

56
00:02:15,695 --> 00:02:18,229
CIA?

57
00:02:18,231 --> 00:02:21,599
Their internal affairs division
intercepted an encrypted message

58
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:24,836
that was sent by someone in the
Agency's Los Angeles office.

59
00:02:24,838 --> 00:02:26,905
They have no idea
what it contains.

60
00:02:26,907 --> 00:02:28,873
A leak.
A leak...

61
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,208
that has given
classified information

62
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,943
to a very dangerous
foreign government.

63
00:02:31,945 --> 00:02:33,711
Yemen.

64
00:02:33,713 --> 00:02:35,380
Could be battle plans,
state secrets, or Intel

65
00:02:35,382 --> 00:02:36,881
that could jeopardize
national security.

66
00:02:36,883 --> 00:02:39,751
CIA wants you to find the leak
and recover whatever was given

67
00:02:39,753 --> 00:02:42,320
to the enemy before it becomes
a potential catastrophe.

68
00:02:42,322 --> 00:02:46,124
Why does one of the world's top
spy organizations need our help?

69
00:02:46,126 --> 00:02:48,426
They can't use their
own encryption analysts

70
00:02:48,428 --> 00:02:51,095
because the leak could be
anyone inside the agency.

71
00:02:51,097 --> 00:02:52,964
Bingo.

72
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:54,465
No more games.

73
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:56,768
It's time to get to work.

74
00:02:58,004 --> 00:03:00,071
This is a black box
combinatorial pointer tree

75
00:03:00,073 --> 00:03:01,639
encryption algorithm.

76
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:02,974
So you can't get in?

77
00:03:02,976 --> 00:03:04,709
No, I cracked it.

78
00:03:04,711 --> 00:03:05,910
Guys.

79
00:03:06,713 --> 00:03:07,845
Okay...

80
00:03:07,847 --> 00:03:10,281
no names or markers

81
00:03:10,283 --> 00:03:12,650
to identify the source
or recipients.

82
00:03:12,652 --> 00:03:14,786
But we do have the text
of the message.

83
00:03:14,788 --> 00:03:18,256
“A minute away from you
is a lifetime.

84
00:03:18,258 --> 00:03:20,625
“I love you with all my heart.

85
00:03:20,627 --> 00:03:22,460
“Soon we'll be together.

86
00:03:22,462 --> 00:03:23,728
B.O.O.”

87
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,496
It's a love letter.
It's a code.

88
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:27,231
“B.O.O.” could be
“base of operations.”

89
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:28,366
Or “black ops officer.”

90
00:03:28,368 --> 00:03:29,934
Or “boo,” like
a pet name.

91
00:03:29,936 --> 00:03:32,603
Maybe whoever sent it
is in love.

92
00:03:32,605 --> 00:03:34,238
Paige, I've read a lot
about espionage,

93
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,574
including every issue
of<i> Robo-Spies--</i>

94
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,076
definitely a
top-five comic

95
00:03:38,078 --> 00:03:40,111
of the spy robot genre--

96
00:03:40,113 --> 00:03:44,082
and “boo” is not how spies would
normally refer to one another.

97
00:03:44,084 --> 00:03:45,817
They encrypted
and anonymized the message perfectly.

98
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:49,620
If they were to add sentimental
verbiage, it would increase

99
00:03:49,622 --> 00:03:51,322
their odds of getting caught--
it would be illogical.

100
00:03:51,324 --> 00:03:53,324
Love is illogical.

101
00:03:53,326 --> 00:03:54,325
It's a code within a code.

102
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:55,259
But this has random text,

103
00:03:55,261 --> 00:03:56,894
it could take
days to break.

104
00:03:56,896 --> 00:03:58,162
So, to plug the leak,

105
00:03:58,164 --> 00:04:00,698
we first go to the
L.A. branch of the CIA

106
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,635
and selectively profile to see
who would betray their country.

107
00:04:04,637 --> 00:04:07,305
And once we have found them,
then we dive into their system.

108
00:04:07,307 --> 00:04:08,673
How do we
profile those guys?

109
00:04:08,675 --> 00:04:10,108
It's the Central
Intelligence Agency.

110
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,343
They have highly trained agents
and state-of-the-art technology.

111
00:04:12,345 --> 00:04:14,245
Yes, but we have you guys.

112
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,722
<i>Internal Affairs knows the leak</i>

113
00:04:24,724 --> 00:04:26,357
came from this CIA office,

114
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:28,359
but it could be anybody
in any division.

115
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:29,694
Division five--
psych ops,

116
00:04:29,696 --> 00:04:31,362
division nine--
languages,

117
00:04:31,364 --> 00:04:32,864
division 12--
skunkworks,

118
00:04:32,866 --> 00:04:34,866
where we create
our classified technology.

119
00:04:34,868 --> 00:04:36,200
But we have eight
more divisions,

120
00:04:36,202 --> 00:04:38,569
plus field agents
and support staff

121
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:40,505
that also...

122
00:04:40,507 --> 00:04:42,407
Shouldn't have mentioned
the technology.

123
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:44,275
Pen pick.

124
00:04:44,277 --> 00:04:45,777
Looks like a pen,

125
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:47,011
but can pick any lock.

126
00:04:47,013 --> 00:04:49,247
All I need is a paper clip.

127
00:04:51,718 --> 00:04:53,384
Gecko hands.

128
00:04:53,386 --> 00:04:54,719
For climbing walls.

129
00:04:54,721 --> 00:04:56,721
Even those made of glass.

130
00:04:56,723 --> 00:04:58,990
Catsuit not included.

131
00:04:58,992 --> 00:05:00,525
Do you own a catsuit?

132
00:05:04,197 --> 00:05:06,564
Wearable electromagnetic
bullet shield.

133
00:05:06,566 --> 00:05:08,433
It won't dampen
concussive force,

134
00:05:08,435 --> 00:05:10,301
but it does deflect the
path of a metal bullet

135
00:05:10,303 --> 00:05:12,737
by up to four inches.

136
00:05:12,739 --> 00:05:14,138
Which can be enough
to save a life.

137
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,207
Oh!

138
00:05:20,513 --> 00:05:23,414
Can you do<i> that</i>
with a paper clip?

139
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:26,818
Field trip's over, kids.

140
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,353
We got work to do.

141
00:05:29,355 --> 00:05:30,755
Hey, did you see that?

142
00:05:30,757 --> 00:05:31,923
A woman who's pretty,

143
00:05:31,925 --> 00:05:34,425
mechanically inclined
<i>and</i> nice.

144
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:36,961
Shut up.

145
00:05:38,331 --> 00:05:40,331
I brought in our top agents
from around the world.

146
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,666
You'll have carte Blanche
to question them.

147
00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:42,668
Send them home.

148
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:43,801
I'm sorry?

149
00:05:43,803 --> 00:05:46,237
Your top spies, the ones
in expensive suits

150
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:48,539
who travel the world
on exciting missions.

151
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,542
They may be experts at
disguise, charming people,

152
00:05:51,544 --> 00:05:54,545
chasing bad guys, but they
could never program the level

153
00:05:54,547 --> 00:05:55,747
of encryption
that message had.

154
00:05:55,748 --> 00:05:58,549
The leak isn't one
of the cool kids.

155
00:05:58,551 --> 00:05:59,884
It's someone like us.

156
00:05:59,886 --> 00:06:01,486
Someone who does the coding.

157
00:06:01,488 --> 00:06:03,821
The grunt work
that makes them look good.

158
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:05,790
Where are the guys
with the faces for radio?

159
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:11,963
Our people.

160
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:14,332
Toby, you getting anything
from these guys?

161
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:16,267
Did they rush Mozart
when he wrote a sonata?

162
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:17,401
You got nothing,
do you?

163
00:06:17,403 --> 00:06:18,369
Not a thing.

164
00:06:18,371 --> 00:06:19,371
Humor me a sec.

165
00:06:19,372 --> 00:06:20,738
What if the code
wasn't a code?

166
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,106
I mean, call me crazy,
but maybe

167
00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:23,741
“soon we will be together”
really meant

168
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,510
“soon we will be together.”

169
00:06:25,512 --> 00:06:27,879
If the leak was in love,

170
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:29,280
how would you profile him?

171
00:06:29,282 --> 00:06:31,282
Well, for one thing,
love increases serotonin,

172
00:06:31,284 --> 00:06:32,783
which means more
energy and alertness.

173
00:06:32,785 --> 00:06:35,386
So I would eliminate those
three guys along the east wall.

174
00:06:35,388 --> 00:06:37,488
They're exhausted;
no<i> joie de vivre.</i>

175
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,689
Probably married.

176
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:40,057
Has anyone here
recently lost

177
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:42,727
a lot of weight trying
to look good for someone?

178
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:45,496
Well, Tim, Leonard and Susan
have all dropped some weight.

179
00:06:45,498 --> 00:06:46,697
Any vacation days?

180
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:48,199
Especially Fridays and Mondays?

181
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:49,634
What would that indicate?

182
00:06:49,636 --> 00:06:51,269
Romantic three-day weekends.

183
00:06:51,271 --> 00:06:52,570
Ever had one?

184
00:06:52,572 --> 00:06:54,238
Kind of, yeah.

185
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,907
She left after one day.

186
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,311
Susan and Tim have taken just
four vacation days between them,

187
00:07:00,313 --> 00:07:01,913
but Leonard's taken
five personal days

188
00:07:01,915 --> 00:07:03,147
in the last
three months,

189
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:06,017
plus four sick days--
all on Fridays and Mondays.

190
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:09,520
Paige is right--
he is a man in<i> l'amour.</i>

191
00:07:09,522 --> 00:07:11,756
That's all the information you
needed to make that assessment?

192
00:07:11,758 --> 00:07:13,758
No, look at his nails--
he had a manicure.

193
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,160
Only one thing'll make a man
sit through one of those--

194
00:07:16,162 --> 00:07:17,261
a woman.

195
00:07:17,263 --> 00:07:19,463
So the guy's got
the hots for someone.

196
00:07:19,465 --> 00:07:21,532
Doesn't mean he'd do
anything unlawful.

197
00:07:21,534 --> 00:07:22,700
We need to talk to him.

198
00:07:22,702 --> 00:07:23,702
Leonard...

199
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,038
you got a moment?
Yes, of course.

200
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:33,277
<i>You're in trouble, Leonard.</i>

201
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,981
We searched your computer,
we searched all your files.

202
00:07:36,983 --> 00:07:39,483
Why would you be sending
encrypted forget-me-nots

203
00:07:39,485 --> 00:07:41,552
to someone
in a hostile government?

204
00:07:41,554 --> 00:07:42,820
Never heard of Hallmark?

205
00:07:42,822 --> 00:07:44,889
I know my rights,
I don't have to help you.

206
00:07:44,891 --> 00:07:46,958
We got your access card;
we read your magnetic code.

207
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,559
You've been making trips

208
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:49,961
to the CIA chem lab.

209
00:07:49,963 --> 00:07:52,463
Internal Affairs is searching
to find out what went missing.

210
00:07:52,465 --> 00:07:54,865
If we discover that you gave
dangerous materials

211
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:56,534
to foreign nationals,

212
00:07:56,536 --> 00:07:58,436
you'll face treason charges.

213
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,404
Okay.

214
00:08:00,406 --> 00:08:02,340
I did sneak out
some chemicals.

215
00:08:02,342 --> 00:08:04,742
But it was just to give them
to an aid worker.

216
00:08:04,744 --> 00:08:08,412
You're a CIA analyst admitting
to a major violation,

217
00:08:08,414 --> 00:08:10,881
yet show no markers
of shame or embarrassment.

218
00:08:10,883 --> 00:08:12,016
Why?

219
00:08:12,018 --> 00:08:14,051
Because I didn't do
anything wrong.

220
00:08:14,053 --> 00:08:16,220
Now, it's technically illegal,

221
00:08:16,222 --> 00:08:19,624
but it's for a legitimate
humanitarian cause.

222
00:08:19,626 --> 00:08:21,926
This is to help
poor people in Yemen.

223
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,030
What do the poor
need chemicals for?

224
00:08:26,032 --> 00:08:27,965
Because of embargos.

225
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:29,300
Yemeni farmers can't get
these chemicals

226
00:08:29,302 --> 00:08:31,235
to make basic pesticides.

227
00:08:31,237 --> 00:08:32,737
Which means that
they can't grow crops,

228
00:08:32,739 --> 00:08:34,972
which is why
they are starving.

229
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:37,908
Now, I-I got her two chemicals,
I was gonna get her one more,

230
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,744
so that she could save
millions.

231
00:08:39,746 --> 00:08:41,279
If they are used
to make pesticides,

232
00:08:41,281 --> 00:08:42,513
why can't she just buy them?

233
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:44,515
They're toxic--
they're tightly regulated.

234
00:08:44,517 --> 00:08:46,851
And-and I would do
anything to help her.

235
00:08:46,853 --> 00:08:48,586
We're in love.

236
00:08:50,423 --> 00:08:51,689
Love is imaginary.

237
00:08:51,691 --> 00:08:53,791
What's real are
those chemicals.

238
00:08:53,793 --> 00:08:55,426
Which ones did you give her?

239
00:08:55,428 --> 00:08:58,095
Phosphorus trichloride and
liquid trans-methyl propylaxine.

240
00:08:58,097 --> 00:09:00,298
Now, the third one that
I haven't brought her yet

241
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,599
is O-ethyl methyphonic acid.

242
00:09:01,601 --> 00:09:04,935
Combined, these chemicals
make pesticide.

243
00:09:04,937 --> 00:09:06,637
They can also
be adjusted.

244
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,572
If you methylate
the phosphorus trichloride,

245
00:09:08,574 --> 00:09:11,609
it forms methyl phosphorus
dichloride...

246
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:14,111
Which, when combined with the
liquid trans-methyl propylaxine

247
00:09:14,113 --> 00:09:15,479
and the O-ethyl
methyphonic acid,

248
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:17,181
creates tiny particles.

249
00:09:17,183 --> 00:09:19,483
Very deadly, easily aerosolized,

250
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:21,319
and completely different
from pesticides.

251
00:09:21,321 --> 00:09:22,620
It's nerve gas.

252
00:09:22,622 --> 00:09:24,155
What...?!

253
00:09:25,358 --> 00:09:26,657
I-I-I didn't know that.

254
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:27,992
N-No, it's irrelevant.

255
00:09:27,994 --> 00:09:29,327
Y-You guys have it all wrong.

256
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:30,494
Sima is a good person.

257
00:09:30,496 --> 00:09:32,363
She targeted you, man.

258
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:33,864
That's ridiculous!

259
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:34,999
No, Sima is...

260
00:09:35,001 --> 00:09:36,200
She's playing you.

261
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,003
She made you think that
she was in love with you

262
00:09:39,005 --> 00:09:40,471
so you would give her
those chemicals.

263
00:09:40,473 --> 00:09:41,672
You're wrong.

264
00:09:41,674 --> 00:09:43,307
And if I'm not,

265
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:45,142
we can't stop her...

266
00:09:45,144 --> 00:09:46,677
millions could die.

267
00:09:54,305 --> 00:09:58,305

Original Air Date on January 18, 2015

Sync, corrected by StoneSub

269
00:10:05,877 --> 00:10:08,722
CIA and Interpol are
checking Sima's background,

270
00:10:08,723 --> 00:10:10,723
but so far they've got
nothing on a woman

271
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:12,157
that might be
making nerve gas.

272
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:14,627
All you need is a few teaspoons
to kill tens of thousands.

273
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:16,228
He took<i> pounds</i> of this stuff.

274
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,330
Yet we show him strong evidence

275
00:10:18,332 --> 00:10:20,165
that Sima might be trying
to manipulate him,

276
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:22,601
and he's still blinded
by emotion-- I don't get it.

277
00:10:22,603 --> 00:10:24,470
Love makes you do
crazy things.

278
00:10:24,472 --> 00:10:26,805
That is why there are
so many songs written about it.

279
00:10:26,807 --> 00:10:28,073
“Crazy Love”
by Van Morrison,

280
00:10:28,075 --> 00:10:30,442
“Crazy in Love” by Beyoncé,

281
00:10:30,444 --> 00:10:32,878
just plain “Crazy”
by Patsy Cline and Aerosmith.

282
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,514
Love is a semi-euphoric,
temporary chemical reaction.

283
00:10:35,516 --> 00:10:36,782
Aw, how romantic.

284
00:10:36,784 --> 00:10:37,850
What is that
under your shirt?

285
00:10:37,852 --> 00:10:39,551
Nothing.
You stole

286
00:10:39,553 --> 00:10:41,453
the CIA's electromagnetic
bullet shield.

287
00:10:41,455 --> 00:10:43,255
The pretty science lady
gave me a prototype.

288
00:10:43,257 --> 00:10:45,124
I guess she likes
the cut of my jib

289
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:47,092
and my understated
sexual charisma.

290
00:10:47,094 --> 00:10:49,628
We don't need prototypes;
we need a plan.

291
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,963
Soon Sima will wonder why

292
00:10:50,965 --> 00:10:52,865
she hasn't heard from Leonard,
she'll get suspicious.

293
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:55,334
Once that happens,
we won't find her.

294
00:10:55,336 --> 00:10:56,802
Leonard's not cooperating.

295
00:10:57,538 --> 00:10:58,904
He may not talk to us,

296
00:10:58,906 --> 00:11:01,273
but we can make him talk to her.

297
00:11:01,275 --> 00:11:03,042
We're gonna
keep looking into this,

298
00:11:03,044 --> 00:11:04,276
but for now
we're letting you go.

299
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:05,878
But before we do,
we need evidence

300
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,112
that you were given your rights

301
00:11:07,114 --> 00:11:08,754
and were questioned
according to protocol.

302
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,016
Read it out loud.

303
00:11:11,018 --> 00:11:12,718
I'm recording it.

304
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,953
“My name is Leonard Carlton.

305
00:11:14,955 --> 00:11:18,090
“I admit to violating
CIA regulations

306
00:11:18,092 --> 00:11:20,159
“but no criminal wrongdoing.

307
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:22,127
Today I was questioned...”

308
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:24,196
Is this going to work?
Yes.

309
00:11:24,198 --> 00:11:25,998
When Walter was in high school,
he created

310
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,334
a similar voice converter
to sound just like his mother.

311
00:11:29,336 --> 00:11:31,503
He used it once
to call in sick to school.

312
00:11:31,505 --> 00:11:33,572
Walter O'Brien played hooky?

313
00:11:33,574 --> 00:11:35,207
There was a quantum physics
lecture in Dublin

314
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:36,308
that he didn't want to miss.

315
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,177
- Of course there was.
- Don't judge.

316
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:39,978
The heart wants
what the heart wants.

317
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,181
So does the brain.

318
00:11:47,588 --> 00:11:49,288
So...

319
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,989
this is sort of a weird request,

320
00:11:50,991 --> 00:11:55,027
but you are a shrink, and...

321
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:57,863
well, I-I need someone
to talk to.

322
00:11:57,865 --> 00:11:59,565
Of course.

323
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:01,567
Lie on my couch.

324
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:05,938
It's about a guy.

325
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,207
Go on.
See, I had a dream.

326
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:09,808
Some disturbing,

327
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:12,277
inappropriate thoughts
about someone I shouldn't,

328
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:15,447
someone who probably
isn't good for me.

329
00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:16,749
I get it.

330
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:17,816
Drew's handsome.

331
00:12:17,818 --> 00:12:19,418
Not bright or loyal,

332
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,886
but handsome.

333
00:12:20,888 --> 00:12:22,488
Right.

334
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,257
See, Leonard in there,

335
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:26,925
he is letting his feelings
cloud his judgment,

336
00:12:26,927 --> 00:12:28,193
and I don't want to do that.

337
00:12:28,195 --> 00:12:29,928
Any advice?
Paige,

338
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,897
I'm a brilliant doctor.

339
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:33,232
I'm brilliant enough to know

340
00:12:33,234 --> 00:12:34,633
you're not telling me everything
about this dream.

341
00:12:34,635 --> 00:12:36,935
Either you're being deceptive

342
00:12:36,937 --> 00:12:38,871
or you're embarrassed, but...

343
00:12:38,873 --> 00:12:41,140
I can't help you until you're
ready to tell me everything.

344
00:12:45,446 --> 00:12:47,913
A mason can't build
without bricks, Paige.

345
00:12:47,915 --> 00:12:50,182
I'm not a miracle worker.

346
00:12:50,184 --> 00:12:51,517
“I acknowledge
no wrongdoing

347
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,287
and hereby certify
the aforementioned is accurate”"

348
00:12:55,289 --> 00:12:57,289
Did we get everything?

349
00:13:00,628 --> 00:13:04,029
Here, read that.

350
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:05,364
“Purple monkey dishwasher.”

351
00:13:05,366 --> 00:13:06,398
What the hell does that mean?

352
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,432
Now we got everything.

353
00:13:07,434 --> 00:13:08,867
Hey, I thought
you were letting me go.

354
00:13:08,869 --> 00:13:10,969
Nope. See how easy it is
to get played?

355
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,773
Okay, I've downloaded

356
00:13:14,775 --> 00:13:16,041
his recording.
Within seconds

357
00:13:16,043 --> 00:13:18,377
my software will break it down

358
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:21,680
phonetically, and...
transmute my voice so that

359
00:13:21,682 --> 00:13:22,781
on the other end,

360
00:13:22,783 --> 00:13:24,049
it will sound exactly...

361
00:13:24,051 --> 00:13:26,351
like Leonard.

362
00:13:26,353 --> 00:13:28,287
Now, with Leonard's phone,

363
00:13:28,289 --> 00:13:30,589
I'll call Sima,
pretending to be him,

364
00:13:30,591 --> 00:13:31,990
and set a meeting

365
00:13:31,992 --> 00:13:33,091
so we can find out

366
00:13:33,093 --> 00:13:34,526
where she has the chemicals.

367
00:13:34,528 --> 00:13:36,428
Are you sure<i> you</i> should
be doing this?

368
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,630
She calls him “boo”"

369
00:13:38,632 --> 00:13:39,798
That's-That's
playful and fun.

370
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,166
Two words that don't exactly

371
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:42,734
describe Walter O'Brien.

372
00:13:42,736 --> 00:13:44,570
It's setting an appointment.
I can handle this.

373
00:13:44,572 --> 00:13:46,371
Now...

374
00:13:46,373 --> 00:13:47,573
his voice will come through

375
00:13:47,575 --> 00:13:49,675
her phone instead
of the speakers.

376
00:13:51,712 --> 00:13:52,878
Hey, baby.

377
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,046
Hello...

378
00:13:54,048 --> 00:13:56,148
you.

379
00:13:57,218 --> 00:13:58,517
Did you have a good day?

380
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:00,152
Average. I hope you've had

381
00:14:00,154 --> 00:14:01,987
an efficient day yourself.

382
00:14:01,989 --> 00:14:03,722
You're going
to give it away.

383
00:14:03,724 --> 00:14:05,090
Hold, please.

384
00:14:05,092 --> 00:14:07,359
What?
I'm making conversation.

385
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:09,895
Be romantic, tell her you can't
stop thinking about her.

386
00:14:09,897 --> 00:14:11,196
Leonard?

387
00:14:15,369 --> 00:14:16,869
I can't stop thinking about you.

388
00:14:16,871 --> 00:14:19,071
Aw... really?

389
00:14:19,073 --> 00:14:20,839
- That's what I just said.
- Oh.

390
00:14:21,675 --> 00:14:23,508
Honey,

391
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,110
I miss you so much,

392
00:14:25,112 --> 00:14:26,245
your face, your mind,

393
00:14:26,247 --> 00:14:28,347
your body...

394
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:30,382
I wish I were with you
right now just,

395
00:14:30,384 --> 00:14:33,852
just touching you,
kissing you.

396
00:14:35,756 --> 00:14:38,090
That sounds so good.

397
00:14:38,092 --> 00:14:40,792
We should be
recording this, too.

398
00:14:40,794 --> 00:14:43,362
When do I get to see you again?

399
00:14:43,364 --> 00:14:44,529
Soon,

400
00:14:44,531 --> 00:14:46,365
but, honey, uh,

401
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:48,066
I've hit a snag.

402
00:14:48,068 --> 00:14:49,835
We have a problem
with the final delivery.

403
00:14:49,837 --> 00:14:51,169
What happened?

404
00:14:51,171 --> 00:14:53,639
They moved the third chemical
to a higher security lab.

405
00:14:53,641 --> 00:14:54,740
I don't have clearance.

406
00:14:54,742 --> 00:14:56,074
The guy who does,

407
00:14:56,076 --> 00:14:57,776
Marvin, would never help us.

408
00:14:57,778 --> 00:14:59,311
He's by the book.

409
00:14:59,313 --> 00:15:01,513
Does he carry
the same security card as you,

410
00:15:01,515 --> 00:15:03,582
only with
the necessary clearance?

411
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:04,716
Yes.

412
00:15:04,718 --> 00:15:05,884
If I get you that card,

413
00:15:05,886 --> 00:15:06,985
can you get the chemical?

414
00:15:06,987 --> 00:15:08,420
Sure.

415
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:10,589
But...

416
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,857
how are you gonna get it?

417
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:13,425
Don't you worry about that.

418
00:15:13,427 --> 00:15:16,561
Just ask Marvin to meet you
for a drink at my hotel,

419
00:15:16,563 --> 00:15:18,730
and then,
at the last minute, cancel.

420
00:15:18,732 --> 00:15:19,898
Will you do that?

421
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,134
Anything for you, honey.

422
00:15:22,136 --> 00:15:25,537
You're such a good person.

423
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:27,406
I have to go now, my love,

424
00:15:27,408 --> 00:15:28,640
but I'll be in touch soon.

425
00:15:28,642 --> 00:15:31,209
I love you, baby.
I love you, too.

426
00:15:33,614 --> 00:15:34,746
That's how it's done.

427
00:15:34,748 --> 00:15:36,214
We have her on tape

428
00:15:36,216 --> 00:15:37,249
admitting to doing this.

429
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:38,817
We can arrest her now.

430
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:40,686
Well, we might have enough
to arrest her,

431
00:15:40,688 --> 00:15:42,587
but there's still two canisters
of dangerous chemicals

432
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:44,656
out there somewhere,
and that's two-thirds of the way

433
00:15:44,658 --> 00:15:45,891
to making nerve gas.

434
00:15:45,893 --> 00:15:47,225
We can't bring Sima in yet.

435
00:15:47,227 --> 00:15:49,628
We need her to lead us
to those chemicals.

436
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,263
Okay, so, who's gonna be Marvin?

437
00:15:51,265 --> 00:15:53,332
Well, Interpol's still doing
a background on Sima,

438
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:55,067
but there's no question
she's probably dangerous.

439
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:56,568
So I'll do it.

440
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,602
No, you're-you're Homeland.

441
00:15:57,604 --> 00:15:59,104
You're former FBI.

442
00:15:59,106 --> 00:16:01,139
She could have Intel
on our agents.

443
00:16:01,141 --> 00:16:02,674
We can't risk her
I.D.'ing you.

444
00:16:02,676 --> 00:16:04,242
Sylvester can't do it;
he's a nervous wreck.

445
00:16:04,244 --> 00:16:06,211
He'd barf all over her.
I would.

446
00:16:06,213 --> 00:16:09,948
Well, I guess
I'll have to do it.

447
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,017
I just hope she doesn't
fall in love with me, too.

448
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:14,186
No, Intel indicates
that she probably works alone,

449
00:16:14,188 --> 00:16:15,887
but we can't be too careful.

450
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:17,990
We need someone to profile
the crowd in that bar

451
00:16:17,992 --> 00:16:19,491
and make sure
she has no collaborators.

452
00:16:19,493 --> 00:16:20,959
So we're down to Walter?

453
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:23,228
Am I the only person
who just heard that phone call?

454
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,564
Oh, I learned a lot
from that exchange.

455
00:16:25,566 --> 00:16:27,499
Okay, we hack the
security cameras at the hotel,

456
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:29,668
we put an earbud
in Walter's ear, and we track

457
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,004
- the entire meeting.
- And while he distracts her,

458
00:16:32,006 --> 00:16:33,271
Toby and I search her room

459
00:16:33,273 --> 00:16:34,973
for evidence
of the stolen chemicals.

460
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,743
After hearing your
performance on the phone,

461
00:16:37,745 --> 00:16:39,177
you're gonna need help.

462
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:40,212
I'll be your Cyrano.

463
00:16:40,214 --> 00:16:42,247
The story of the guy
with the rhinophyma,

464
00:16:42,249 --> 00:16:43,815
the large nose disease.

465
00:16:43,817 --> 00:16:46,118
You missed
the whole love story?

466
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,587
I was focused
on his medical condition.

467
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:51,356
Come with me.

468
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:54,092
This is not gonna be easy.

469
00:16:54,094 --> 00:16:57,496
Here, this color's good on you.

470
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,803
That color<i> is</i> nice on you.

471
00:17:04,805 --> 00:17:06,138
Yeah?
Now, to give Happy and Toby

472
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,339
time to search her room,

473
00:17:07,341 --> 00:17:08,673
you'll need to
stall her in the bar.

474
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:10,075
If she detects anything off,

475
00:17:10,077 --> 00:17:12,077
she could flee or make a call

476
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,278
and those chemicals
could disappear forever,

477
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,348
and if she did what
we think she did,

478
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,583
she did it by using her allure.

479
00:17:18,585 --> 00:17:20,318
She'll do the same thing
with you,

480
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,889
so you'll need to pretend like
you're falling for her charms.

481
00:17:23,891 --> 00:17:25,757
Copy that.

482
00:17:26,927 --> 00:17:28,827
Engage with her
on a personal level.

483
00:17:28,829 --> 00:17:29,995
No.

484
00:17:29,997 --> 00:17:31,863
No engaging-- flirting.

485
00:17:31,865 --> 00:17:34,566
Do you even know how?

486
00:17:34,568 --> 00:17:36,935
Look, you need to pick up
her vibe and return it.

487
00:17:36,937 --> 00:17:39,337
Let's practice; I'll flirt
with you, and you flirt back.

488
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:49,748
Go ahead. Flirt back.

489
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:52,384
I am.

490
00:17:52,386 --> 00:17:54,186
I mean, you need
to give off a vibe

491
00:17:54,188 --> 00:17:55,687
like you're interested in me.

492
00:17:55,689 --> 00:17:57,289
Copy that.

493
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,491
How's this?

494
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:03,929
Okay, moving on.

495
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:06,364
Uh, she'll probably try to steal
an access card from you,

496
00:18:06,366 --> 00:18:07,933
even though you don't have one.

497
00:18:07,935 --> 00:18:10,969
She'll probably try to...

498
00:18:10,971 --> 00:18:12,737
touch you.

499
00:18:12,739 --> 00:18:13,972
Feel your pocket.

500
00:18:13,974 --> 00:18:16,708
No, I don't enjoy contact.

501
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,043
I know,
I've seen you hug people.

502
00:18:18,045 --> 00:18:19,811
It's like
you're in a leper colony.

503
00:18:19,813 --> 00:18:23,448
You need to be ready
for whatever she might do.

504
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,183
I can handle it.

505
00:18:25,185 --> 00:18:26,585
Can you?

506
00:18:31,425 --> 00:18:35,460
What if...
she does... this?

507
00:18:37,264 --> 00:18:39,464
Or...

508
00:18:42,035 --> 00:18:43,635
...this?

509
00:18:43,637 --> 00:18:46,605
Why, I would be okay with that.

510
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:49,141
And if she got...

511
00:18:49,143 --> 00:18:51,209
close?

512
00:18:54,748 --> 00:18:56,014
I...

513
00:18:56,016 --> 00:18:57,449
I think I could

514
00:18:57,451 --> 00:18:59,651
handle that.

515
00:19:01,088 --> 00:19:03,255
This could happen.

516
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,827
I will be r-ready.

517
00:19:08,829 --> 00:19:10,362
I will be ready.

518
00:19:11,465 --> 00:19:13,465
Good work.

519
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,980
Any sign of collaborators?

520
00:19:28,982 --> 00:19:30,715
Those three are
legitimately loaded.

521
00:19:30,717 --> 00:19:32,217
Spies do not get drunk
on the job.

522
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:33,818
That couple

523
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,920
has a baby.

524
00:19:34,922 --> 00:19:36,621
That's a definite
espionage no-no.

525
00:19:36,623 --> 00:19:38,557
And those guys
are actually USC fans.

526
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,958
You can tell
by how depressed they are.

527
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,992
So, coast is clear.

528
00:19:40,994 --> 00:19:42,227
Sima's alone.

529
00:19:42,229 --> 00:19:43,528
Speak of the devil.

530
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,996
That must be her.

531
00:19:44,998 --> 00:19:46,765
♪ ♪

532
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:48,366
Oh, my God.

533
00:19:48,368 --> 00:19:50,001
Walter's a dead man.

534
00:19:54,942 --> 00:19:57,209
Hi.
Hi.

535
00:19:58,178 --> 00:19:59,178
Meeting someone?

536
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:01,046
Yeah, I was supposed to. My...

537
00:20:01,048 --> 00:20:03,949
He, uh, texted me

538
00:20:03,951 --> 00:20:05,250
he can't make it.

539
00:20:05,252 --> 00:20:07,919
Good.

540
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:09,621
Then you can buy me a drink.

541
00:20:09,623 --> 00:20:10,689
I'm Sima.

542
00:20:10,691 --> 00:20:12,724
Sima, Marvin.
Pleasure.

543
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:14,159
What are you having?

544
00:20:14,161 --> 00:20:15,760
I'm having...

545
00:20:15,762 --> 00:20:16,695
water.

546
00:20:16,697 --> 00:20:17,963
He doesn't drink.

547
00:20:17,965 --> 00:20:20,365
But that's good,
because I want

548
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:22,434
to remember the moment
a beautiful woman

549
00:20:22,436 --> 00:20:24,502
asked me to have
a drink with her.

550
00:20:24,504 --> 00:20:26,805
But that is good, because
I want to remember the moment

551
00:20:26,807 --> 00:20:29,040
a beautiful woman asked me
to have a drink with her.

552
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:31,076
Smoother

553
00:20:31,078 --> 00:20:32,577
than the Scotch
they're serving.

554
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:34,379
Interpol report just came in.

555
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:35,914
Sima's just an alias.

556
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,148
Her real name is Fatima.

557
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,316
They tracked her activities.

558
00:20:38,318 --> 00:20:40,485
Tokyo, Berlin, Minsk?

559
00:20:40,487 --> 00:20:42,087
She has honey-trapped
half the agents

560
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:43,321
in the Western world.

561
00:20:43,323 --> 00:20:45,023
She's wanted for two
unsolved murders in Prague.

562
00:20:45,025 --> 00:20:46,758
You got to be careful, Walt.

563
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,994
Scratch your temple
if you copy.

564
00:20:50,864 --> 00:20:52,964
Sylvester, you're up.

565
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:55,300
Did you say she was wanted

566
00:20:55,302 --> 00:20:56,434
for two murders?

567
00:20:56,436 --> 00:20:57,602
Go!

568
00:21:02,075 --> 00:21:03,541
Come on!

569
00:21:03,543 --> 00:21:06,111
A shovel pass on
third and long?!

570
00:21:06,113 --> 00:21:08,546
That was an ineffective choice.

571
00:21:13,053 --> 00:21:15,086
It's not reading
the access card.

572
00:21:15,088 --> 00:21:16,454
Try moving the phone around.

573
00:21:18,091 --> 00:21:19,291
Get out of there!

574
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,494
Got it. She's in 1002.

575
00:21:22,496 --> 00:21:23,995
What the hell
are you waiting for?

576
00:21:23,997 --> 00:21:27,265
Go see if there's any sign
of those chemicals.

577
00:21:27,267 --> 00:21:29,467
So, then the eight
told the seven,

578
00:21:29,469 --> 00:21:31,569
“What do you expect from me?
I'm a square root”"

579
00:21:37,844 --> 00:21:39,477
So, you enjoy math humor.

580
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:40,679
I love it.

581
00:21:40,681 --> 00:21:42,614
Man, she's good.

582
00:21:44,318 --> 00:21:45,684
Uh, Walter,
she flipped her hair.

583
00:21:45,686 --> 00:21:47,018
That's a flirtation marker.

584
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,220
Smile back.

585
00:21:50,757 --> 00:21:53,525
Less.

586
00:21:53,527 --> 00:21:55,293
He looks like he's birthing.

587
00:21:55,295 --> 00:21:57,295
What do you do, Marvin?
I...

588
00:21:57,297 --> 00:21:58,330
work for the government.

589
00:21:58,332 --> 00:21:59,864
I'm an analyst.

590
00:21:59,866 --> 00:22:01,533
So, you're smart?

591
00:22:03,503 --> 00:22:05,337
I like smart guys.

592
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,840
Don't-don't-don't freeze.

593
00:22:08,842 --> 00:22:10,041
Put your hand on hers.

594
00:22:10,043 --> 00:22:11,443
Slowly move your fingers
back and forth.

595
00:22:11,445 --> 00:22:13,178
Slow down.

596
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,813
Just let her know you're there.

597
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,717
Perfect.

598
00:22:18,719 --> 00:22:19,884
Hold her gaze.

599
00:22:19,886 --> 00:22:21,186
And look at her like you want

600
00:22:21,188 --> 00:22:22,220
to know everything

601
00:22:22,222 --> 00:22:23,822
there is to know about her.

602
00:22:23,824 --> 00:22:26,725
Look at her
like you've never known

603
00:22:26,727 --> 00:22:28,093
a woman like her before

604
00:22:28,095 --> 00:22:30,462
and never will again.

605
00:22:30,464 --> 00:22:32,197
Tell her...

606
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:34,466
from the moment you saw her

607
00:22:34,468 --> 00:22:37,235
your definition
of “stunning” changed.

608
00:22:37,237 --> 00:22:40,605
You know, from the
moment I saw you...

609
00:22:40,607 --> 00:22:44,709
my definition of
“stunning” changed.

610
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:46,478
Perfect.

611
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,413
What's taking so long? Open it.

612
00:22:48,415 --> 00:22:51,082
I can't. She booby-trapped it.

613
00:22:51,084 --> 00:22:53,218
We open this,
an alarm will notify her.

614
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,552
We have no other way in.

615
00:22:54,554 --> 00:22:55,720
Actually, we do.

616
00:22:55,722 --> 00:22:57,889
Come on.

617
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,896
The gecko gloves from the CIA?

618
00:23:04,898 --> 00:23:07,198
She gave me those, too.

619
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,167
I'm charming like that.

620
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:20,678
Huh.

621
00:23:22,115 --> 00:23:23,615
It's a full moon out tonight.

622
00:23:23,617 --> 00:23:25,750
Not funny.

623
00:23:25,752 --> 00:23:27,919
You know, you look hot.

624
00:23:27,921 --> 00:23:29,187
Come on, why don't
we get that jacket

625
00:23:29,189 --> 00:23:30,755
off of you?
She wants to search your jacket

626
00:23:30,757 --> 00:23:33,124
for the access card.

627
00:23:33,126 --> 00:23:34,526
You need to stall.

628
00:23:34,528 --> 00:23:35,794
Do it.

629
00:23:35,796 --> 00:23:37,362
Yeah, why not?

630
00:23:38,598 --> 00:23:40,532
Beautiful jacket. Yes.

631
00:23:43,603 --> 00:23:45,570
You know, on second thought...

632
00:23:45,572 --> 00:23:47,505
do you want to get out of here?

633
00:23:47,507 --> 00:23:49,174
Oh, you want to go
to another bar?

634
00:23:49,176 --> 00:23:52,710
She means upstairs, Walter.

635
00:23:52,712 --> 00:23:55,647
You know, I never...
do this.

636
00:23:55,649 --> 00:23:57,982
Maybe it's the drink,
I don't know, but...

637
00:23:57,984 --> 00:24:00,652
I'm just going
to say how I feel.

638
00:24:00,654 --> 00:24:03,188
I want you
to come to my room.

639
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,856
She thinks the card's
in his pants.

640
00:24:04,858 --> 00:24:06,591
And those pants
won't stay on long.

641
00:24:06,593 --> 00:24:07,759
Happy! Toby!

642
00:24:07,761 --> 00:24:08,893
Where the hell are you?

643
00:24:08,895 --> 00:24:11,229
Happy's climbing up
the side of the building

644
00:24:11,231 --> 00:24:13,431
to Sima's room right now.

645
00:24:16,436 --> 00:24:17,635
Hurry up!

646
00:24:17,637 --> 00:24:19,170
I'm sorry.

647
00:24:19,172 --> 00:24:20,405
Am I not scaling the building

648
00:24:20,407 --> 00:24:23,708
by hand fast enough for you?

649
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,577
Where's Happy?

650
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,346
Oh, God...

651
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:32,917
Happy!
Aah! No, no,

652
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:34,018
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

653
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,253
Happy?

654
00:24:35,255 --> 00:24:36,821
The stupid glove
stopped sticking!

655
00:24:36,823 --> 00:24:39,324
You know your little girlfriend
at the CIA

656
00:24:39,326 --> 00:24:40,625
who designs this stuff?

657
00:24:40,627 --> 00:24:42,627
Yeah.
Yeah, she sucks!

658
00:24:45,031 --> 00:24:46,464
Oh, not good.

659
00:24:56,482 --> 00:24:58,648
- Come on, man.
- Sylvester?

660
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,383
We have got to catch
her if she falls.

661
00:25:00,385 --> 00:25:02,219
From 30 feet?
She could kill us.

662
00:25:02,221 --> 00:25:05,355
Sylvester, think of something!
Okay, okay! The force of gravity

663
00:25:05,357 --> 00:25:07,023
is 9.81 meters
per second squared.

664
00:25:07,025 --> 00:25:08,692
If she swings hard to her left,

665
00:25:08,694 --> 00:25:09,893
then her right hand
would completely

666
00:25:09,895 --> 00:25:10,927
disengage from the building.

667
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:12,529
And for 2/10 of a second

668
00:25:12,531 --> 00:25:13,997
she won't be
attached to anything.

669
00:25:13,999 --> 00:25:16,700
But she can use that time
to get to the balcony...

670
00:25:16,702 --> 00:25:18,134
or plummet to her death.

671
00:25:18,136 --> 00:25:20,136
Very reassuring!
Okay.

672
00:25:20,138 --> 00:25:23,306
If you get enough momentum,
it could work!

673
00:25:23,308 --> 00:25:24,508
Or not!

674
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,877
It's 50/50!
It's natural to be scared.

675
00:25:26,879 --> 00:25:28,678
You should be scared!

676
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,780
You're the one
who gave me these gloves!

677
00:25:30,782 --> 00:25:31,848
You're slipping!

678
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,917
Do it now!

679
00:25:37,489 --> 00:25:38,755
Ah...!

680
00:25:39,758 --> 00:25:41,625
How did she pull that off?

681
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:45,395
'Cause she's Happy
Frickin' Quinn.

682
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,644
Clock's ticking, Happy.
What do you got?

683
00:25:53,668 --> 00:25:54,839
Nothing.

684
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,740
You better hurry.
They're in the elevator.

685
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,910
Walter, Happy's
in the room right now.

686
00:25:59,912 --> 00:26:00,710
You have to stall.

687
00:26:00,712 --> 00:26:03,079
Mm...

688
00:26:03,782 --> 00:26:06,182
You're impatient.

689
00:26:06,184 --> 00:26:07,751
I like that.

690
00:26:07,753 --> 00:26:09,519
- Mm...
- Walter?

691
00:26:09,521 --> 00:26:11,922
Tell her there's another woman
that you care about.

692
00:26:11,924 --> 00:26:14,758
Listen, there's, um,

693
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,226
there's this other woman...

694
00:26:16,228 --> 00:26:18,795
and, um, what you and I

695
00:26:18,797 --> 00:26:20,797
are about to do
could complicate

696
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,267
an already complicated
situation.

697
00:26:25,938 --> 00:26:29,039
Marvin, let me assure you,

698
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:30,740
what you and I are about to do

699
00:26:30,742 --> 00:26:33,810
will be the least complicated
thing you'll ever experience.

700
00:26:36,381 --> 00:26:38,782
Okay.

701
00:26:38,784 --> 00:26:40,483
Uh, how much longer do I have?

702
00:26:41,219 --> 00:26:42,953
Two minutes. Tops.

703
00:26:43,855 --> 00:26:44,921
There are no cameras
in the room.

704
00:26:44,923 --> 00:26:46,656
Fill me in.
What are you doing?

705
00:26:49,528 --> 00:26:50,760
I'm checking her stuff.

706
00:26:50,762 --> 00:26:53,296
There might be a secret hollow
or something.

707
00:26:53,298 --> 00:26:55,131
Just leave everything
the way you found it.

708
00:26:55,133 --> 00:26:56,833
They're stepping off
the elevator.

709
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:02,606
I just found a key
for a Lock-Ur-Stuff facility.

710
00:27:03,408 --> 00:27:05,008
Now, why would
an international spy

711
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,244
who's always traveling the world
rent a storage facility?

712
00:27:08,246 --> 00:27:10,013
'Cause maybe that's where
she's keeping the chemicals.

713
00:27:10,015 --> 00:27:11,715
Happy, get the hell
out of there!

714
00:27:12,351 --> 00:27:13,650
And, uh, how do I do that?

715
00:27:13,652 --> 00:27:15,986
The gloves are useless.
I'm not Spiderwoman.

716
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:20,090
They're coming down the hall!
They're almost there!

717
00:27:20,092 --> 00:27:22,559
Hide now!
Uh, where?

718
00:27:22,561 --> 00:27:23,893
And do not tell me
under the bed,

719
00:27:23,895 --> 00:27:25,095
because that's the worst...

720
00:27:25,097 --> 00:27:26,896
Happy still hasn't
gotten out, Walter.

721
00:27:26,898 --> 00:27:29,165
You can't let her in.
You need to do something!

722
00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:32,869
Think fast!
Oh, no...

723
00:27:32,871 --> 00:27:34,304
Something wrong?

724
00:27:34,306 --> 00:27:36,139
Yes.

725
00:27:41,513 --> 00:27:44,047
Oh, my God.

726
00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:45,849
That is a humdinger.

727
00:27:57,729 --> 00:27:59,329
I'm out! Where's
the closest Lock-Ur-Stuff?

728
00:27:59,331 --> 00:28:02,465
Two blocks away.
You and Toby are with me.

729
00:28:02,467 --> 00:28:03,633
Sylvester and Paige,

730
00:28:03,635 --> 00:28:05,669
keep your eyes on Walter
and help him distract Sima

731
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:07,537
until we get those chemicals.

732
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:09,105
I'm not sure he needs any help.

733
00:28:09,107 --> 00:28:10,874
I hate to disagree, but
she's not that into it.

734
00:28:10,876 --> 00:28:11,975
No hands on the back
of the head.

735
00:28:11,977 --> 00:28:13,143
No fingers through the hair.

736
00:28:13,145 --> 00:28:15,779
Maybe Walter's a bad kisser.

737
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:17,681
Okay, let's go.

738
00:28:17,683 --> 00:28:20,216
Hold down the fort, kid.
We'll be back in five.

739
00:28:20,218 --> 00:28:24,087
I'm going to go slip into
something less constricting.

740
00:28:24,089 --> 00:28:25,321
We're gonna lose visual!

741
00:28:25,323 --> 00:28:27,157
No bedroom, Walter.
Ha-Happy wasn't able

742
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:28,224
to put everything back.

743
00:28:28,226 --> 00:28:30,427
If Sima sees,
your cover's blown.

744
00:28:30,429 --> 00:28:33,663
There's no point.

745
00:28:33,665 --> 00:28:36,733
Whatever you put on,
you'll be out of it

746
00:28:36,735 --> 00:28:38,001
in a matter of minutes.

747
00:28:38,003 --> 00:28:39,669
Oh...

748
00:28:39,671 --> 00:28:42,906
Tell her you want her
on the couch.

749
00:28:44,443 --> 00:28:45,575
I want you on the couch.

750
00:28:45,577 --> 00:28:47,444
Mmm!

751
00:28:47,446 --> 00:28:48,945
Tell her you can't wait
to have her.

752
00:28:48,947 --> 00:28:50,947
I can't wait to have you.
But first...

753
00:28:50,949 --> 00:28:52,515
tell her you want to order

754
00:28:52,517 --> 00:28:53,950
champagne from room service.

755
00:28:53,952 --> 00:28:55,985
What? No.

756
00:28:55,987 --> 00:28:57,754
What do you mean “no”?
Uh, what?

757
00:28:57,756 --> 00:28:59,322
Nothing.
Just, uh... you know...

758
00:28:59,324 --> 00:29:00,324
You...

759
00:29:00,325 --> 00:29:01,325
Oh...!

760
00:29:01,326 --> 00:29:02,759
...just need to sit there

761
00:29:02,761 --> 00:29:04,494
and watch.

762
00:29:06,131 --> 00:29:08,998
97% certain sure I just heard
an extended zipper pull.

763
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,633
Most likely a dress.

764
00:29:10,635 --> 00:29:12,469
Thank you, Sylvester.

765
00:29:12,471 --> 00:29:13,471
You're welcome.

766
00:29:18,777 --> 00:29:21,411
You will never forget
this night.

767
00:29:21,413 --> 00:29:23,113
Say...

768
00:29:23,115 --> 00:29:24,948
“I've wanted to be with you

769
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:27,484
since the moment
I laid eyes on you.”

770
00:29:27,486 --> 00:29:30,086
I... I love hearing

771
00:29:30,088 --> 00:29:31,588
your voice in my ear.

772
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,522
Thank you.

773
00:29:32,524 --> 00:29:34,591
Thank you.

774
00:29:48,807 --> 00:29:50,306
Careful.

775
00:29:50,308 --> 00:29:52,342
She might've
booby-trapped this thing.

776
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,214
Yup. This is the stuff.

777
00:29:58,216 --> 00:30:00,383
We got a problem.
Look at that.

778
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,987
It's a pressure alarm.

779
00:30:03,989 --> 00:30:05,388
Not good?

780
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,490
Definitely not good.

781
00:30:08,493 --> 00:30:10,326
Hmm?

782
00:30:10,328 --> 00:30:11,795
What's that?

783
00:30:11,797 --> 00:30:13,229
Oh, nothing.

784
00:30:13,231 --> 00:30:14,364
It's just an alarm.

785
00:30:14,366 --> 00:30:16,199
I can never
get it set right.

786
00:30:16,201 --> 00:30:17,700
That is a strange watch

787
00:30:17,702 --> 00:30:20,970
to be outfitted with
modern electronics.

788
00:30:26,978 --> 00:30:30,380
Walter? Walter?

789
00:30:30,382 --> 00:30:32,816
Walter, say something!

790
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:04,021
Now that our relationship
has evolved,

791
00:31:04,023 --> 00:31:06,424
maybe you should tell me
your real name.

792
00:31:06,426 --> 00:31:08,993
I've already told
you my name, Fatima.

793
00:31:08,995 --> 00:31:11,796
That's not my real name, either.

794
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:13,231
Are we going somewhere?

795
00:31:13,233 --> 00:31:14,765
I'm going home.

796
00:31:14,767 --> 00:31:17,034
And if your associates
can follow my directions,

797
00:31:17,036 --> 00:31:18,603
so are you.

798
00:31:18,605 --> 00:31:20,304
I don't have any associates.

799
00:31:20,306 --> 00:31:22,507
No?

800
00:31:23,343 --> 00:31:26,010
While you were sleeping,
we made a deal.

801
00:31:26,012 --> 00:31:29,480
They bring me the two canisters
from my storage facilities,

802
00:31:29,482 --> 00:31:31,349
and Leonard gets the third
from the CIA lab.

803
00:31:31,351 --> 00:31:34,652
They give<i> me</i>
all three chemicals,

804
00:31:34,654 --> 00:31:36,687
I let you go.

805
00:31:36,689 --> 00:31:38,689
Everybody wins.

806
00:31:38,691 --> 00:31:39,991
And they're coming here?

807
00:31:39,993 --> 00:31:41,859
You'd better hope so.

808
00:31:51,838 --> 00:31:53,170
Got it.

809
00:31:53,172 --> 00:31:55,740
Tail number: N888C41.

810
00:31:55,742 --> 00:31:58,543
Are we sure this is a good idea?
You got a better one?

811
00:31:58,545 --> 00:32:00,411
It's better than handing over
latent chemical weapons

812
00:32:00,413 --> 00:32:02,146
to an anti-American agent?

813
00:32:02,148 --> 00:32:03,481
Give me a minute.

814
00:32:03,483 --> 00:32:05,483
If we don't give her
what she wants, Walter dies.

815
00:32:05,485 --> 00:32:07,785
We got to do whatever we can
to get him off that plane.

816
00:32:07,787 --> 00:32:09,353
She's far too cautious.

817
00:32:09,355 --> 00:32:12,023
she'll keep him as collateral
to get out of American airspace.

818
00:32:14,193 --> 00:32:15,693
It's time to get our man.

819
00:32:24,437 --> 00:32:26,103
Welcome aboard.

820
00:32:30,977 --> 00:32:32,076
Where's Leonard?

821
00:32:32,078 --> 00:32:33,945
Uh, we didn't need him.

822
00:32:33,947 --> 00:32:35,379
The CIA gave us
the third chemical.

823
00:32:35,381 --> 00:32:37,715
There's all three chemicals
in the satchel.

824
00:32:37,717 --> 00:32:39,216
They're the real thing.

825
00:32:39,218 --> 00:32:41,385
There's a litmus test
in there to prove it.

826
00:32:45,825 --> 00:32:47,858
Let's go, buddy.

827
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,027
Uncuff him.

828
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:52,463
New plan-- once we've landed
safely in neutral territory,

829
00:32:52,465 --> 00:32:54,665
he'll be released.

830
00:32:54,667 --> 00:32:56,567
We had a deal.
Yes.

831
00:32:56,569 --> 00:32:59,337
And the deal was Leonard was
supposed to come with you.

832
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:02,540
How? Leonard's on his way
to a federal penitentiary.

833
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,376
She has an emotional
connection with him.

834
00:33:05,378 --> 00:33:06,444
She knows you
could have gotten

835
00:33:06,446 --> 00:33:07,745
the chemicals
without Leonard,

836
00:33:07,747 --> 00:33:09,747
she only wants him here
because she loves him.

837

You uncuff my man...

838

for you for Leonard.

But right now,
we gotta figure out

848
00:33:46,819 --> 00:33:49,487
how to stop that plane,
or Walter's as good as dead.

849
00:33:49,489 --> 00:33:50,955

Cabe said Sima will make it.

882
00:37:23,295 --> 00:37:25,962
Maybe she and Leonard will be
in adjoining penitentiaries.

883
00:37:25,964 --> 00:37:27,964
So she loved him.

It's not logical.

885
00:37:29,301 --> 00:37:30,467
It's actually
totally logical.

886
00:37:30,469 --> 00:37:31,801
It's called
the Wiseman Effect.

If you pretend you're
in love with someone,

sometimes you actually
start to believe it.

That's why she wouldn't
really kiss you back.

00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:47,684
She had the chance
to get away,

894
00:37:47,686 --> 00:37:50,987
but she gave it up for love,
for something that's not real.

The most important thing
to Sima, or whatever her name was,
