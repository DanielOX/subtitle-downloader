1
00:00:05,216 --> 00:00:06,812
<i>My name is Walter O'Brien.</i>

2
00:00:06,959 --> 00:00:11,295
<i>I have the fourth highest IQ</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

3
00:00:11,297 --> 00:00:13,046
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

4
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:15,666
<i>When I was 11, the FBI</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking NASA</i>

5
00:00:15,668 --> 00:00:18,335
<i>to get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

6
00:00:18,337 --> 00:00:20,554
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

7
00:00:20,556 --> 00:00:22,005
<i>tackling worldwide threats</i>

8
00:00:22,007 --> 00:00:23,507
<i>only we can solve.</i>

9
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:25,259
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

10
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:27,027
<i>Sylvester's a human calculator.</i>

11
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:29,346
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

12
00:00:29,348 --> 00:00:31,648
<i>Agent Cabe Gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

13
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,851
<i>And Paige?</i>
<i>Well, Paige isn't like us.</i>

14
00:00:33,853 --> 00:00:36,353
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

15
00:00:36,355 --> 00:00:38,939
<i>while we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

16
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:41,074
<i>Together, we are Scorpion.</i>

17
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:53,203
In the past 24 hours,
you have broken over two dozen

18
00:00:53,205 --> 00:00:54,705
state and federal laws.

19
00:00:54,707 --> 00:00:56,039
You've dealt Homeland Security

20
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,041
a public relations nightmare.

21
00:00:58,043 --> 00:01:00,043
And you destroyed
over $100 million

22
00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:02,262
worth of private property!

23
00:01:02,264 --> 00:01:03,547
Which is why you

24
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:05,182
ironically named geniuses...

25
00:01:05,184 --> 00:01:06,967
The wrong use of “ironic.”

26
00:01:08,053 --> 00:01:11,388
...are hereby ordered for
psychological evaluation.

27
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,807
That evaluation
decides your future.

28
00:01:13,809 --> 00:01:15,025
From what I see,

29
00:01:15,027 --> 00:01:17,644
you're too mentally unstable
to handle this job.

30
00:01:20,065 --> 00:01:21,949
Anything else

31
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:23,150
smart you want to say?

32
00:01:23,152 --> 00:01:24,401
No.

33
00:01:34,196 --> 00:01:36,830
So much for your
little experiment.

34
00:01:36,832 --> 00:01:40,834
And as the psychologist
assigned to this case,

35
00:01:40,836 --> 00:01:44,037
I will interview each member
of your team individually.

36
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:47,841
You will take me through the
events of the past 24 hours

37
00:01:47,843 --> 00:01:50,093
and explain your decisions.

38
00:01:50,095 --> 00:01:52,095
Happy to help however I can.

39
00:01:52,097 --> 00:01:53,897
Lying is one hallmark

40
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:56,683
of antisocial
personality disorder.

41
00:01:56,685 --> 00:01:58,402
So, first off,

42
00:01:58,404 --> 00:02:00,103
I suggest you be honest.

43
00:02:00,105 --> 00:02:02,656
Honestly?

44
00:02:02,658 --> 00:02:03,824
I'm looking at your diploma,

45
00:02:03,826 --> 00:02:05,659
thinking I could have got
into your Alma mater

46
00:02:05,661 --> 00:02:06,843
when I was seven.

47
00:02:06,845 --> 00:02:09,162
Let's start

48
00:02:09,164 --> 00:02:11,365
at the beginning.

49
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:14,451
Okay, but first
I-I should mention

50
00:02:14,453 --> 00:02:17,254
that I also have a PhD
in clinical psychology.

51
00:02:17,256 --> 00:02:19,790
Perhaps our time would be
better spent talking about you.

52
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:21,842
I don't think so.

53
00:02:21,844 --> 00:02:25,128
Say more about that.

54
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,713
Ask me anything.

55
00:02:26,715 --> 00:02:28,765
I'm an open book.

56
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:30,884
<i>It all started yesterday.</i>

57
00:02:30,886 --> 00:02:33,103
One sec.

58
00:02:33,105 --> 00:02:35,105
Oh, my God.

59
00:02:35,107 --> 00:02:36,723
Okay.

60
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,309
All right.

61
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:40,644
From the beginning.

62
00:02:40,646 --> 00:02:42,529
Well, it all began
with costumes.

63
00:02:45,284 --> 00:02:48,986
Hmm, do you have the summary
document on our last job?

64
00:02:48,988 --> 00:02:51,071
Good morning
to you, too, Walter.

65
00:02:51,073 --> 00:02:52,472
How are you today?

66
00:02:52,474 --> 00:02:54,791
Oh, you prefer
a different greeting.

67
00:02:54,793 --> 00:02:56,326
Okay. Good morning.
How are you?

68
00:02:56,328 --> 00:02:58,412
Do you have the summary document
on our last job?

69
00:02:58,414 --> 00:02:59,830
I'll send it to you.

70
00:02:59,832 --> 00:03:01,081
And thank you for asking.

71
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,983
I've been preparing for Ralph's

72
00:03:02,985 --> 00:03:05,218
school Halloween party tomorrow,
but he doesn't want

73
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,803
to go 'cause he has
no one to go with.

74
00:03:06,805 --> 00:03:08,171
Mm-hmm.

75
00:03:08,173 --> 00:03:09,890
Come on, it's Halloween.

76
00:03:09,892 --> 00:03:10,974
Exactly.

77
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,676
What does that mean?
It's a holiday

78
00:03:12,678 --> 00:03:15,345
based on 16th century traditions
of warding off evil spirits.

79
00:03:15,347 --> 00:03:17,064
It's not exactly progress.

80
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:18,315
To say nothing
of contributions

81
00:03:18,317 --> 00:03:19,516
to tooth decay,

82
00:03:19,518 --> 00:03:20,901
juvenile diabetes, early death.

83
00:03:20,903 --> 00:03:22,936
You asked.

84
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:26,857
Good news.

85
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:28,859
Your friend the governor has
recommended you for a new gig.

86
00:03:28,861 --> 00:03:31,344
And unlike the last few,
this one's cushy.

87
00:03:31,346 --> 00:03:32,696
The Westside Museum of Art

88
00:03:32,698 --> 00:03:35,916
is having a new exhibit of
a masterpiece by Franz Biermann.

89
00:03:35,918 --> 00:03:36,950
I love his work.
Never heard of him.

90
00:03:36,952 --> 00:03:38,618
The Verstand
Museum in Germany

91
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,669
owns the painting,

92
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:41,038
but while it's
within our borders

93
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,706
it falls under the
purview of Homeland.

94
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:45,042
We picked up some chatter
on some dark-net sites.

95
00:03:45,044 --> 00:03:47,127
It's a highly coveted
target for art thieves.

96
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:49,963
We need you to upgrade the
security systems at the museum.

97
00:03:49,965 --> 00:03:51,548
I'll fill you in on the
details on the way.

98
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,050
And Merrick granted
your request.

99
00:03:54,136 --> 00:03:56,303
What request?

100
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,190
<i>This is great.</i>

101
00:04:00,192 --> 00:04:02,392
Traveling together will
increase efficiency.

102
00:04:02,394 --> 00:04:04,728
This is on trial loan
from the department,

103
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,229
so go easy on it.

104
00:04:06,231 --> 00:04:07,364
Cushy gig aside,

105
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:09,282
isn't security work a little
below our pay grade?

106
00:04:09,284 --> 00:04:10,817
The painting's worth
a hundred million bucks.

107
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:14,621
How is $32 of paint and canvas
worth a hundred million?

108
00:04:14,623 --> 00:04:16,990
It's one of humanity's great achievements.
It's paint and canvas.

109
00:04:16,992 --> 00:04:18,625
Art critic
Leslie Reinman calls it

110
00:04:18,627 --> 00:04:22,329
“an exquisite rendering
of late 19th century

111
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:24,081
“small-town tranquility

112
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,750
“whose rhapsodic gestures
connote optimism

113
00:04:26,752 --> 00:04:27,752
“and...

114
00:04:27,753 --> 00:04:29,920
possibility.”

115
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,406
Um...

116
00:04:33,408 --> 00:04:34,674
Are you okay?

117
00:04:34,676 --> 00:04:37,477
My hypersensitivity and
overactive emotional quotient

118
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:40,480
are at times triggered
by works of art.

119
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,816
Don't tell me you
have a problem

120
00:04:42,818 --> 00:04:44,151
with Halloween
<i>and</i> art.

121
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:45,819
They're both make-believe.
All ascribed value.

122
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:47,320
I took a
night school class

123
00:04:47,322 --> 00:04:48,405
on Gauguin.

124
00:04:48,407 --> 00:04:50,190
Ever seen his
paintings of Tahiti?

125
00:04:50,192 --> 00:04:52,526
They're mind-blowing.

126
00:04:52,528 --> 00:04:54,995
Well, in the time period
of the Biermann painting,

127
00:04:54,997 --> 00:04:56,580
there were grain shortages
and starvation.

128
00:04:56,582 --> 00:04:58,448
That old woman looks
like she has gout.

129
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,617
That ten-year-old girl--
middle-aged.

130
00:05:00,619 --> 00:05:03,170
Hmm.
You can't openly mock things

131
00:05:03,172 --> 00:05:04,172
99% of the world enjoys.

132
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:05,672
If you want to grow
this business,

133
00:05:05,674 --> 00:05:07,207
take on private clients,

134
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:08,925
even be a functioning
member of society,

135
00:05:08,927 --> 00:05:10,927
you have to learn how
normal people work.

136
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:12,963
Yes, but to what end?

137
00:05:12,965 --> 00:05:15,932
You being more human could
help us get more jobs

138
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:17,384
and improve relationships
with superiors,

139
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:19,269
make<i> my</i> life more sane.

140
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:21,521
Think of it as
an experiment.

141
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:24,691
I'll give it a try.

142
00:05:24,693 --> 00:05:27,027
<i>Geniuses have</i>

143
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:29,146
low EQ, or emotional quotient,

144
00:05:29,148 --> 00:05:31,481
hence their difficulty
relating to us.

145
00:05:31,483 --> 00:05:33,950
Sure, they have their issues,
but they're also

146
00:05:33,952 --> 00:05:36,736
brilliant
and-and brave and special.

147
00:05:36,738 --> 00:05:38,672
You're protecting
your job.

148
00:05:38,674 --> 00:05:40,240
If I thought they were unstable,

149
00:05:40,242 --> 00:05:42,375
would I allow my son
around them?

150
00:05:43,712 --> 00:05:46,997
Your son...<i> is</i> them.

151
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,167
Thank you.

152
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:53,003
I think he's special, too.

153
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:57,824
Take me through
Walter's behavior at the museum.

154
00:05:59,094 --> 00:06:00,377
Um...

155
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,762
<i> This is</i>
<i>an exceedingly rare work</i>

156
00:06:01,763 --> 00:06:04,181
by an artist whose other paintings
have all been destroyed

157
00:06:04,183 --> 00:06:06,349
during World War II,
so as curator,

158
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:08,018
its security is

159
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,069
my responsibility,

160
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:10,937
and forgive me
for saying so, but...

161
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:14,157
they don't seem like
typical law enforcement.

162
00:06:19,831 --> 00:06:21,698
We're<i> not</i> typical

163
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,200
law enforcement,
Dr. Paulson.

164
00:06:23,202 --> 00:06:24,367
We're better.

165
00:06:25,537 --> 00:06:27,204
Very excited
to protect

166
00:06:27,206 --> 00:06:29,539
your beautiful
and important art.

167
00:06:30,692 --> 00:06:32,542
Right.

168
00:06:34,096 --> 00:06:35,295
Was that supposed to be normal?

169
00:06:35,297 --> 00:06:37,380
Experiment's begun--
not bad, huh?

170
00:06:38,217 --> 00:06:39,716
Terrifying.

171
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:42,435
Good luck with this.

172
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:55,282
Take a look at this.

173
00:07:06,245 --> 00:07:07,827
He's getting
<i>awfully</i> close to it.

174
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:09,129
Maybe he's enjoying it.

175
00:07:09,131 --> 00:07:12,082
Walter may have some EQ.

176
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,219
No!

177
00:07:22,594 --> 00:07:23,760
And...

178
00:07:23,762 --> 00:07:26,479
I stand corrected.

179
00:07:30,746 --> 00:07:37,246
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

180
00:07:38,472 --> 00:07:39,839
I was doing my job.

181
00:07:41,108 --> 00:07:44,409
Slashing a canvas
is your job?

182
00:07:44,411 --> 00:07:47,495
Or evidence of your lack
of emotional maturity?

183
00:07:47,497 --> 00:07:49,063
Both. I don't
have emotions.

184
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:50,799
I read that
in your file.

185
00:07:50,801 --> 00:07:52,333
But how can you
protect something

186
00:07:52,335 --> 00:07:54,135
if you don't
care about it?

187
00:07:54,137 --> 00:07:55,703
I care about my paycheck.

188
00:07:55,705 --> 00:07:59,541
I can't really tell if you're purposely
being contemptuous,

189
00:07:59,543 --> 00:08:02,010
of maybe you are unstable.
Well, if you dismissed

190
00:08:02,012 --> 00:08:04,012
every government worker
who was unstable,

191
00:08:04,014 --> 00:08:05,763
Washington would cease to exist.

192
00:08:05,765 --> 00:08:07,699
Giving these responses,

193
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:09,968
how do you expect me
to approve you?

194
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,186
I don't.

195
00:08:11,188 --> 00:08:13,304
But to fail us would be
to disregard the fact

196
00:08:13,306 --> 00:08:15,390
that no matter
how many people got upset,

197
00:08:15,392 --> 00:08:16,691
my actions had a purpose.

198
00:08:16,693 --> 00:08:18,560
I cut the painting
to thoroughly examine

199
00:08:18,562 --> 00:08:20,778
both sides of the canvas--
it was efficient.

200
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,730
Efficient?
Are you out of your mind?

201
00:08:22,732 --> 00:08:24,816
Do you have any idea
how much this painting is worth?

202
00:08:24,818 --> 00:08:26,651
Yes-- as I
said, nothing.

203
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:28,453
It's a fake.

204
00:08:28,455 --> 00:08:30,071
And there are several
reasons why

205
00:08:30,073 --> 00:08:31,322
we knew this,
starting with Paige.

206
00:08:31,324 --> 00:08:32,624
She loves this artist.

207
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:34,125
Seeing the painting
should have made her happy.

208
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:35,627
But when she
looked at the painting,

209
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:37,245
she displayed
the same repulsion markers

210
00:08:37,247 --> 00:08:38,746
our sense of smell gives us

211
00:08:38,748 --> 00:08:40,748
to rotting meat
when it exudes an odor.

212
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,417
Her subconscious
instinctively knew

213
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,403
something was off, but she
didn't know what it was.

214
00:08:45,405 --> 00:08:47,088
Then I did a quick count
of the brushstrokes.

215
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,289
There's one thousand,
three hundred

216
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,090
and eighty-seven,

217
00:08:49,092 --> 00:08:50,008
which is

218
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,259
48 less than the original.

219
00:08:51,261 --> 00:08:52,510
And...

220
00:08:52,512 --> 00:08:53,928
the type of nails
in the frame

221
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,680
weren't even manufactured
until four years

222
00:08:55,682 --> 00:08:57,815
after this painting
was supposedly made.

223
00:08:57,817 --> 00:08:59,567
Rotting meat...

224
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:01,519
brushstrokes...

225
00:09:01,521 --> 00:09:03,605
and nails?

226
00:09:04,624 --> 00:09:06,274
That's all you had to go on

227
00:09:06,276 --> 00:09:07,775
before you destroyed
a masterpiece?

228
00:09:07,777 --> 00:09:08,860
A fake masterpiece.

229
00:09:08,862 --> 00:09:10,278
He's right.

230
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,330
Special Agent Carey,
FBI Art Crimes.

231
00:09:12,332 --> 00:09:13,815
We just analyzed
the paint

232
00:09:13,817 --> 00:09:15,116
and carbon-dated
the frame.

233
00:09:15,118 --> 00:09:16,451
The painting
<i>is</i> a forgery.

234
00:09:16,453 --> 00:09:17,835
Thank you
for repeating

235
00:09:17,837 --> 00:09:20,838
exactly what I said
63 minutes ago.

236
00:09:24,794 --> 00:09:26,961
That is a lovely windbreaker.

237
00:09:26,963 --> 00:09:29,130
We may be able to I.D.

238
00:09:29,132 --> 00:09:31,099
the forger by fingerprints
left in the paint.

239
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:33,351
Well, you won't find
any fingerprints in the paint,

240
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:35,136
because this painting
wasn't made by hand,

241
00:09:35,138 --> 00:09:36,387
it was made by machine.

242
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:38,940
A forgery of this quality
made by a machine?

243
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:41,059
Not possible.
You're right.

244
00:09:41,061 --> 00:09:42,477
It's not possible, it's certain.

245
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:43,978
Since there's no longer
a painting to protect,

246
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,814
I'm gonna ask you... to leave.

247
00:09:48,652 --> 00:09:50,818
We very much thank you
for the opportunity to...

248
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,820
Go.

249
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,157
How else was I supposed
to tell him it was a fake?

250
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:59,994
Perhaps by saying,
“It's a fake.”

251
00:09:59,996 --> 00:10:04,215
When delivering bad news, most
people try and do so gently.

252
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:05,149
Waste of time.

253
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:07,502
How'd the knife work for you?

254
00:10:08,505 --> 00:10:11,089
Miraculously,
Special Agent Carey

255
00:10:11,091 --> 00:10:13,174
wants you to stay
on the case.

256
00:10:13,176 --> 00:10:15,893
So she appreciated
my efforts.

257
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:18,096
She found you smug, arrogant

258
00:10:18,098 --> 00:10:20,098
and several other
choice adjectives.

259
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,685
But the FBI is lacking
expertise on this technology.

260
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:25,103
Explain your theory.

261
00:10:25,105 --> 00:10:28,273
Thrilled to help anyone who
thinks we're smug and arrogant.

262
00:10:28,275 --> 00:10:30,241
The force of a human hand
applying brushstrokes

263
00:10:30,243 --> 00:10:32,660
would result in tiny
broken canvas fibers.

264
00:10:32,662 --> 00:10:35,029
But that canvas was
perfectly intact.

265
00:10:35,031 --> 00:10:37,498
Only a machine arm could
paint so delicately.

266
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,951
Plus, the mathematical patterns
in the paint were so precise

267
00:10:39,953 --> 00:10:41,286
that they couldn't
have been executed

268
00:10:41,288 --> 00:10:42,754
so flawlessly by a human being.

269
00:10:42,756 --> 00:10:45,506
So, we follow the technology
to track down the forger.

270
00:10:45,508 --> 00:10:47,041
And I'll have
Art Crimes investigate

271
00:10:47,043 --> 00:10:49,010
who swapped the original
for the fake, and when.

272
00:10:49,012 --> 00:10:50,712
We know the original
was authenticated

273
00:10:50,714 --> 00:10:53,598
by Customs at LAX
at 6:42 this morning,

274
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,800
so we know the swap occurred
sometime after that.

275
00:10:55,802 --> 00:10:59,387
But they'd have to canvass
airport staff, art handlers,

276
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:01,356
transport personnel--
Th-that could take days.

277
00:11:01,358 --> 00:11:02,724
Well, the problem is,

278
00:11:02,726 --> 00:11:03,941
most stolen art
leaves the country

279
00:11:03,943 --> 00:11:05,503
within 24 hours,
never to be seen again.

280
00:11:07,113 --> 00:11:09,197
I know someone who can help us
track it down,

281
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:11,232
but I want you all
on primo behavior.

282
00:11:13,236 --> 00:11:14,952
A fake Biermann?

283
00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:16,738
Does no one have any respect?

284
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,772
Real or fake, it doesn't matter.

285
00:11:17,774 --> 00:11:19,157
If the people looking
at it can't tell,

286
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,375
what's the difference?

287
00:11:21,077 --> 00:11:22,910
Believe me, I know.

288
00:11:23,963 --> 00:11:26,881
Tell me about your
machine theory.

289
00:11:26,883 --> 00:11:28,416
In order to create a
high-quality forgery

290
00:11:28,418 --> 00:11:29,418
using a machine,

291
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:31,252
you'd first need
a three-dimensional scan

292
00:11:31,254 --> 00:11:32,236
of the painting,

293
00:11:32,238 --> 00:11:34,088
capturing every detail

294
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,973
from the brushstroke direction
to the thickness and volume

295
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:37,091
of the paint.

296
00:11:37,093 --> 00:11:38,593
Then a spectral camera
would create

297
00:11:38,595 --> 00:11:40,762
an algorithmic breakdown
of the colors,

298
00:11:40,764 --> 00:11:43,848
to be mixed by the 3-D printer
and applied by machine arm.

299
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,400
But first the forger would need

300
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:47,935
an extremely high-res image
of the original.

301
00:11:47,937 --> 00:11:49,437
Do you know how we can get
our hands on one?

302
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:51,406
When I was a costumer in London,

303
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:53,574
I used to visit
the Royal Stuart Museum.

304
00:11:53,576 --> 00:11:57,779
They keep digital images
of major artworks.

305
00:11:57,781 --> 00:11:58,996
Those images have
high enough resolution

306
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:00,615
to be used
by the forgers.

307
00:12:00,617 --> 00:12:02,083
I'll just hack in.

308
00:12:02,085 --> 00:12:04,118
Or... you could use
my account number.

309
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:08,456
Thank you.

310
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:12,293
Unfortunately, the
Biermann's been stolen before.

311
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:18,099
This is the actual
provenance of the painting.

312
00:12:18,101 --> 00:12:20,301
“1936, Eckhart Mueller,
a Jewish shoemaker

313
00:12:20,303 --> 00:12:23,688
“from Warsaw, buys
the painting directly from

314
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,139
“the artist Franz Biermann.

315
00:12:25,141 --> 00:12:28,526
“1942, the Nazis seize
the painting from Mueller

316
00:12:28,528 --> 00:12:31,979
and send him to Auschwitz,
where he's murdered by the SS.”

317
00:12:31,981 --> 00:12:33,064
“1946,

318
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:34,315
“the Verstand Museum
takes possession

319
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:35,317
“of the painting.

320
00:12:35,318 --> 00:12:36,701
“Since then
three generations

321
00:12:36,703 --> 00:12:37,735
“of the Muellers
have tried

322
00:12:37,737 --> 00:12:39,153
unsuccessfully to get it back.”

323
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:41,439
This family has spent a lifetime

324
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:43,074
trying to get
this painting back.

325
00:12:43,076 --> 00:12:45,710
Art has meaning.

326
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,963
Found the image.

327
00:12:48,965 --> 00:12:50,214
4K resolution.

328
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:51,883
More than enough
to create the forgery.

329
00:12:51,885 --> 00:12:54,135
According
to the manifest,

330
00:12:54,137 --> 00:12:55,219
this file's
been downloaded by

331
00:12:55,221 --> 00:12:56,671
Ecole des Beaux-Arts students,

332
00:12:56,673 --> 00:12:58,890
art book publishers
and once by

333
00:12:58,892 --> 00:13:02,176
somebody from... Galactic Toys.

334
00:13:02,178 --> 00:13:03,845
Oh, here we go.
Okay,

335
00:13:03,847 --> 00:13:07,348
Galactic has the greatest
superhero pantheon in this

336
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,900
or any
other universe,

337
00:13:08,902 --> 00:13:11,569
including my personal favorite,
Super Fun Guy.

338
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:13,271
I'm getting to it. Walter,

339
00:13:13,273 --> 00:13:14,739
I'm getting
to it, okay?

340
00:13:14,741 --> 00:13:17,608
They manufacture
these little masterpieces

341
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,077
using state-of-the-art,
cutting-edge

342
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,280
3-D printers and scanners.

343
00:13:22,282 --> 00:13:23,698
They have everything
one would need

344
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,032
to create the perfect forgery.

345
00:13:25,034 --> 00:13:26,868
The forger must work there!

346
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,787
And he is so... lucky.

347
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:31,539
We'll scan
their network

348
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,208
and I.D. the employee
on the way.

349
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,710
Thank you, Hetty.

350
00:13:35,712 --> 00:13:39,263
Thank you.
It, uh, was an experience.

351
00:13:39,265 --> 00:13:42,133
Okay, guys, come on! Let's go!

352
00:13:44,187 --> 00:13:46,304
I've never seen
him move so fast.

353
00:13:46,306 --> 00:13:48,639
<i>Okay, Galactic Toys.</i>

354
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:51,859
The I.P. address and LAN subnets
have narrowed it down to...

355
00:13:51,861 --> 00:13:54,061
ten employees,
four of which work

356
00:13:54,063 --> 00:13:56,564
in administration, which means
they lack the skill set

357
00:13:56,566 --> 00:13:57,782
to even run
the technology.

358
00:13:57,784 --> 00:14:00,151
Well, eliminate anyone
with a title of VP or above.

359
00:14:00,153 --> 00:14:01,235
They wouldn't risk their pension

360
00:14:01,237 --> 00:14:02,403
on criminal activity.

361
00:14:02,405 --> 00:14:03,955
Well, that leaves five.
Only three

362
00:14:03,957 --> 00:14:05,573
have art backgrounds.
That one!

363
00:14:05,575 --> 00:14:07,625
Look at that knockoff
designer sweater.

364
00:14:07,627 --> 00:14:10,244
He doesn't care about the difference
between real and fake.

365
00:14:10,246 --> 00:14:12,413
A man after my own heart.
Phil Daniels.

366
00:14:12,415 --> 00:14:13,831
Married, three kids.

367
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,566
Needs money, has
ability and motive.

368
00:14:19,005 --> 00:14:21,422
Hey, Cabe,
I'm gonna go with you.

369
00:14:21,424 --> 00:14:23,758
You're all staying here,
and that's an order.

370
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,426
I'll be back
in ten minutes.

371
00:14:25,428 --> 00:14:27,428
He's been waiting for this his whole life.
Well, then he should

372
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,647
be used to it. I don't need
a bunch of geniuses

373
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:31,265
to help me detain
an unarmed artist.

374
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,954
Could you at least get me
a Super Fun Guy T-shirt?

375
00:14:38,074 --> 00:14:40,274
He's really...
Cabe, he's really fun!

376
00:14:44,747 --> 00:14:48,666
I am 50 feet from Valhalla,
but I might as well be 50 miles.

377
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:51,035
Maybe you should
emulate Sylvester.

378
00:14:51,037 --> 00:14:54,088
He might be extreme,
but at least... he emotes.

379
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,123
That is not ideal to me.

380
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,458
<i>So if Walter</i>

381
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,094
has no emotional
quotient, you have...

382
00:15:00,096 --> 00:15:01,812
Infinitely too much.

383
00:15:02,715 --> 00:15:04,215
What are you looking at?

384
00:15:04,217 --> 00:15:07,301
That bookshelf's not anchored.

385
00:15:07,303 --> 00:15:08,970
If there was an earthquake,
it could fall,

386
00:15:08,972 --> 00:15:11,472
it could crush you, causing
massive trauma, a concussion.

387
00:15:11,474 --> 00:15:13,307
Plus, I wouldn't want to see
any of that blood.

388
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:15,309
I'm sorry.

389
00:15:15,311 --> 00:15:16,527
You asked me
a question?

390
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:19,981
Does your anxiety hinder
your ability to do your job?

391
00:15:19,983 --> 00:15:21,198
And if so,

392
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,150
how can you work on this team?

393
00:15:23,152 --> 00:15:24,535
Well, because of Walter.

394
00:15:24,537 --> 00:15:27,538
He keeps me out of my head,
keeps me focused on the work.

395
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,956
But if I were you,
I would...

396
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:32,543
I'd just move the chair just,
like, a couple inches.

397
00:15:32,545 --> 00:15:33,661
<i>I don't get it.</i>

398
00:15:33,663 --> 00:15:35,713
Because the parrot
has a hat on.

399
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:38,332
Oh, that's funny.
Uh, technically.

400
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:39,500
It's funny completely.

401
00:15:39,502 --> 00:15:40,751
No. Break it down logically,

402
00:15:40,753 --> 00:15:43,254
bringing a parrot into a bar
makes no sense.

403
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:46,507
You're disappointed.

404
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:49,343
Just starting to see the scope
of what needs to be done.

405
00:15:52,315 --> 00:15:53,981
In the meantime,
I can still solve this case.

406
00:15:53,983 --> 00:15:54,982
Cut him off at the corner.

407
00:15:54,984 --> 00:15:55,816
Okay.

408
00:15:55,818 --> 00:15:56,818
I'll get Cabe!

409
00:15:56,819 --> 00:15:58,519
It's faster to call him!
What?

410
00:15:58,521 --> 00:15:59,687
I can't hear you!

411
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:01,188
Hey! Hey!

412
00:16:05,828 --> 00:16:08,879
Stop! Stop! I'm a federal agent!

413
00:16:11,618 --> 00:16:12,450
Hey!

414
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:21,459
Are you working out
some issues?

415
00:16:21,461 --> 00:16:22,627
Shh!

416
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:24,295
Ow.

417
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,310
Hey! Hey!

418
00:16:51,908 --> 00:16:53,491
I can't...

419
00:16:56,496 --> 00:16:58,129
I looked

420
00:16:58,131 --> 00:16:59,330
everywhere for you.

421
00:17:12,595 --> 00:17:13,811
Are those chicken feathers?

422
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:15,262
This is all fixable.

423
00:17:29,163 --> 00:17:33,424
Whether or not I'm stable--
fascinating question.

424
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:37,785
I've personally treated
many mentally unstable people.

425
00:17:37,787 --> 00:17:39,420
Dated some, too.

426
00:17:39,422 --> 00:17:41,939
You're trying to game me again,
Mr. Curtis.

427
00:17:41,941 --> 00:17:43,574
Answer my question.

428
00:17:43,576 --> 00:17:45,509
I'm rock steady.
The only reason

429
00:17:45,511 --> 00:17:46,760
we disregarded Cabe's orders

430
00:17:46,762 --> 00:17:48,796
is because we had
to chase Daniels.

431
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:50,464
He could have led us
to the painting.

432
00:17:50,466 --> 00:17:52,716
Through busy downtown streets.

433
00:17:52,718 --> 00:17:56,220
Government employees are
supposed to protect property,

434
00:17:56,222 --> 00:17:58,021
not destroy it.

435
00:17:58,023 --> 00:18:00,224
You can't make an omelet
without breaking a few eggs.

436
00:18:00,226 --> 00:18:01,425
That's not
a metaphor.

437
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:03,560
I'm just stating a fact
about breakfast.

438
00:18:03,562 --> 00:18:06,980
You know another sign
of antisocial behavior?

439
00:18:06,982 --> 00:18:08,065
Witty humor?

440
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:09,450
Addiction issues.

441
00:18:09,452 --> 00:18:11,351
That's my favorite kind.

442
00:18:11,353 --> 00:18:12,703
All I know is

443
00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:14,571
I'm in good hands
in the employ of Walter O'Brien,

444
00:18:14,573 --> 00:18:17,658
one of the most intelligent
human beings in the world.

445
00:18:18,911 --> 00:18:22,746
From my file, it seems like
you're in competition with him.

446
00:18:22,748 --> 00:18:25,999
No. He's infinitely smarter
than both of us.

447
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:28,168
When I met him,
I was gambling

448
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,755
every night,
in jail pretty often, too.

449
00:18:31,757 --> 00:18:34,892
I'd still be there
if it weren't for Walter.

450
00:18:34,894 --> 00:18:37,761
He's pretty exceptional.

451
00:18:37,763 --> 00:18:40,414
Don't tell him I said that.

452
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,182
You spooked him.

453
00:18:42,184 --> 00:18:45,319
He won't talk. The FBI
gave us one hour with him

454
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:46,653
and we're at zero.

455
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,856
That's what happens
when a guy gets chased

456
00:18:48,858 --> 00:18:52,192
by a bunch of weirdos in a van
covered in chicken feathers.

457
00:18:52,194 --> 00:18:54,194
The FBI searched
his house,

458
00:18:54,196 --> 00:18:56,997
his storage locker, his records,
everything, turned up nothing.

459
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:58,999
The painting's
worth $100 mil.

460
00:18:59,001 --> 00:19:00,601
If he doesn't
talk fast,

461
00:19:00,603 --> 00:19:02,136
we'll never see it again.

462
00:19:02,138 --> 00:19:04,872
Give me 30 seconds with him.

463
00:19:12,164 --> 00:19:15,015
So, Agent Gallo in there
thinks you stole the painting.

464
00:19:15,017 --> 00:19:16,350
I know
you didn't do it.

465
00:19:16,352 --> 00:19:17,551
Well, finally,

466
00:19:17,553 --> 00:19:19,436
someone who believes
I'm innocent.

467
00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:20,721
I didn't say you're innocent.

468
00:19:20,723 --> 00:19:23,190
You graduated CalArts
nine years ago,

469
00:19:23,192 --> 00:19:25,809
dreaming of becoming
the next Picasso.

470
00:19:25,811 --> 00:19:27,861
Then you had
a few small shows, but...

471
00:19:27,863 --> 00:19:29,730
the decision makers in suits
didn't get your brilliance.

472
00:19:29,732 --> 00:19:33,767
Then you slipped one past
the goalie with your girlfriend.

473
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:35,269
Diapers
are not cheap.

474
00:19:35,271 --> 00:19:38,071
So you took a job
with Galactic Toys.

475
00:19:38,073 --> 00:19:40,407
It's hard to believe you've been
there nearly a decade,

476
00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:43,443
watching your dreams
slip away. But the calluses

477
00:19:43,445 --> 00:19:45,879
on your right thumb and
middle finger tell me you still

478
00:19:45,881 --> 00:19:47,498
paint every day.

479
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,333
You're
an artist.

480
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:52,419
All artists want the same thing:
recognition.

481
00:19:52,421 --> 00:19:54,588
So when someone offered
to pay you to forge a painting,

482
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,789
that felt good.

483
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,392
Finally, someone recognized
your skill.

484
00:19:58,394 --> 00:20:01,979
In fact, you could have done
that whole thing by hand.

485
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:04,298
You only supplemented
your skill with a machine

486
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,465
because they made you.

487
00:20:05,467 --> 00:20:07,050
I want a lawyer.
Sure,

488
00:20:07,052 --> 00:20:08,602
that'll convince people
you're innocent.

489
00:20:08,604 --> 00:20:10,103
Whoever paid you
to make that fake

490
00:20:10,105 --> 00:20:14,858
stole the original themselves,
making you an accomplice.

491
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,109
Whoa.

492
00:20:16,111 --> 00:20:18,662
I was hired to make a copy
of a painting,

493
00:20:18,664 --> 00:20:20,447
which is not illegal.

494
00:20:20,449 --> 00:20:22,925
What the guy did with it
after that is his business.

495
00:20:22,949 --> 00:20:23,668
The irony is

496
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:26,486
he's not gonna take the fall
for it-- you are.

497
00:20:27,706 --> 00:20:28,956
Just give me his name.

498
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,291
Jacques Labeaux.
Real estate tycoon.

499
00:20:31,293 --> 00:20:33,377
Friend of the mayor. He paid
Daniels to forge the painting.

500
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:36,029
Most of Labeaux's
online accounts

501
00:20:36,031 --> 00:20:37,631
were impenetrable,
but we discovered

502
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:39,383
that he pays
two electric bills,

503
00:20:39,385 --> 00:20:40,601
one for his main house

504
00:20:40,603 --> 00:20:43,103
and one for a separate
climate-controlled room.

505
00:20:43,105 --> 00:20:44,388
It's a wine cellar.

506
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,773
No, that's not a wine cellar.

507
00:20:46,775 --> 00:20:49,610
Look at the electricity usage.
It's a huge room.

508
00:20:49,612 --> 00:20:54,615
Much more suitable for...
storing art.

509
00:20:54,617 --> 00:20:56,233
Gonna have to trust Happy
on this one, Toby.

510
00:20:56,235 --> 00:20:57,985
Trust me on
this, Walter.

511
00:20:57,987 --> 00:21:00,237
We're talking wine,
one of my specialties.

512
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:01,572
Doesn't really
matter right now.

513
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:02,739
All we have
is the word

514
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:04,825
of an admitted forger.

515
00:21:04,827 --> 00:21:06,577
We'll never get a search warrant
with that alone.

516
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:08,245
I'll call in
some favors

517
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:09,413
and see if I can't get
a wiretap,

518
00:21:09,415 --> 00:21:10,747
but that'll take some time.

519
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:12,883
You hang tight until you
receive further orders.

520
00:21:12,885 --> 00:21:15,969
I'll update you as soon
as I have something.

521
00:21:15,971 --> 00:21:16,920
Okay.

522
00:21:16,922 --> 00:21:18,472
So Labeaux commissioned
the fake,

523
00:21:18,474 --> 00:21:20,390
so we have to assume
he has a real painting.

524
00:21:20,392 --> 00:21:21,725
Chances are he's
trying to move it.

525
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:22,926
Any idea on his whereabouts?

526
00:21:22,928 --> 00:21:24,261
Uh...

527
00:21:24,263 --> 00:21:25,429
I'm digging,

528
00:21:25,431 --> 00:21:27,397
I'm digging...
Okay, got some thing.

529
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:29,766
He's at home, preparing for

530
00:21:29,768 --> 00:21:32,486
a big charity gala tonight.
Guys!

531
00:21:32,488 --> 00:21:34,071
This is happening
right now.

532
00:21:34,073 --> 00:21:36,056
He'll be hosting
hundreds of people,

533
00:21:36,058 --> 00:21:38,241
three bars, live music...

534
00:21:38,243 --> 00:21:39,443
And us.

535
00:21:40,663 --> 00:21:41,778
Cabe told us...

536
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,614
Cabe is gonna cost us
an opportunity.

537
00:21:43,616 --> 00:21:45,115
Are we really
going to smuggle

538
00:21:45,117 --> 00:21:46,583
a painting out
during a party?

539
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:48,702
There will be equipment
coming in and out,

540
00:21:48,704 --> 00:21:50,003
trucks, commotion...

541
00:21:50,005 --> 00:21:51,455
The whole thing
could be a subterfuge

542
00:21:51,457 --> 00:21:53,924
to try and smuggle that painting
out of the country tonight.

543
00:21:53,926 --> 00:21:54,958
Now, Happy,
Toby...

544
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
you'll slip in,

545
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:57,294
try and locate that painting.

546
00:21:57,296 --> 00:21:58,795
If you can't find it, then,

547
00:21:58,797 --> 00:22:01,131
we're gonna need all the details
that we can get

548
00:22:01,133 --> 00:22:03,083
on Labeaux
and his business dealings.

549
00:22:03,085 --> 00:22:06,053
Paige, I'm gonna hack us
onto the guest list.

550
00:22:06,055 --> 00:22:08,522
Try and get as close to Labeaux
so we can clone his phone.

551
00:22:08,524 --> 00:22:11,058
Sly, you'll QB from the van.

552
00:22:12,194 --> 00:22:14,478
Without Cabe,
we won't get the gear we need.

553
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,979
And I have nothing to wear.

554
00:22:17,149 --> 00:22:20,701
I am not being a diva.
I was a broke waitress

555
00:22:20,703 --> 00:22:22,319
six weeks ago.
I literally have

556
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:24,321
nothing to wear
for a fancy party.

557
00:22:24,323 --> 00:22:26,657
I know someone
who can help on both fronts.

558
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:28,792
You were smart to come back.

559
00:22:28,794 --> 00:22:31,978
This party, I'm sure, will have

560
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,581
a fashion-forward crowd.

561
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,199
And in the wrong clothes,
you'd be

562
00:22:36,201 --> 00:22:37,467
spotted immediately as fakes.

563
00:22:37,469 --> 00:22:38,885
It's Halloween weekend.

564
00:22:38,887 --> 00:22:40,504
Why isn't Labeaux
having a costume ball?

565
00:22:40,506 --> 00:22:43,256
'Cause rich people are smart.

566
00:22:43,258 --> 00:22:45,175
They know
that Halloween is foolish.

567
00:22:45,177 --> 00:22:47,511
Aren't you a ray of sunshine?

568
00:22:47,513 --> 00:22:49,346
And I'm a waiter.

569
00:22:49,348 --> 00:22:51,264
Wow.

570
00:22:51,266 --> 00:22:53,650
Sometimes
I even surprise myself.

571
00:22:53,652 --> 00:22:56,019
Is this okay?

572
00:22:59,024 --> 00:23:00,240
Brava.

573
00:23:00,242 --> 00:23:01,825
Really?

574
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:03,276
Yes.

575
00:23:04,196 --> 00:23:06,530
You silver-tongued devil, you.

576
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:09,199
Well, what about...
what about, what about me?

577
00:23:09,201 --> 00:23:11,334
Well, you're
in the van, so

578
00:23:11,336 --> 00:23:13,987
you can wear your stupid shirt.

579
00:23:13,989 --> 00:23:15,038
Yes.

580
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,757
Uh, do you have any

581
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:18,875
Halloween costumes for
a nine-year-old boy?

582
00:23:18,877 --> 00:23:21,712
Like a... like a
zombie or a ninja or

583
00:23:21,714 --> 00:23:23,964
a pirate?

584
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:26,016
Um, I'll keep looking.

585
00:23:26,018 --> 00:23:27,718
These comm devices

586
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,636
are on an encoded
frequency.

587
00:23:29,638 --> 00:23:32,372
There you go.

588
00:23:32,374 --> 00:23:33,690
And there.

589
00:23:33,692 --> 00:23:34,692
Thank you.

590
00:23:34,693 --> 00:23:36,393
Out you go.

591
00:23:36,395 --> 00:23:38,562
Before I start to regret

592
00:23:38,564 --> 00:23:40,814
loaning you
my things.

593
00:23:50,492 --> 00:23:52,576
I've never been
to a party like this.

594
00:23:54,246 --> 00:23:55,579
Don't worry.

595
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:58,081
We'll fit right in.

596
00:24:09,344 --> 00:24:11,144
Thank you.

597
00:24:11,146 --> 00:24:12,896
Of course.

598
00:24:14,183 --> 00:24:16,399
Sorry.

599
00:24:22,608 --> 00:24:24,758
There you go.

600
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,610
What about the guest list?

601
00:24:26,612 --> 00:24:28,245
Oh, I took care of it.

602
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:32,666
Last name?

603
00:24:32,668 --> 00:24:34,367
Gauguin.

604
00:24:47,716 --> 00:24:49,883
Looks just like
my apartment.

605
00:24:49,885 --> 00:24:51,551
Focus.

606
00:24:51,553 --> 00:24:53,470
We may never
recover that painting

607
00:24:53,472 --> 00:24:56,389
unless we get Labeaux's
data, wherever he is.

608
00:24:58,026 --> 00:25:01,611
<i>Mesdames et messieurs,</i>
<i>bienvenue.</i>

609
00:25:01,613 --> 00:25:03,814
I'm your host
Jacques Labeaux.

610
00:25:03,816 --> 00:25:05,816
And tonight
we will be raising money

611
00:25:05,818 --> 00:25:08,652
for the
Arts Are Fundamental Charity.

612
00:25:08,654 --> 00:25:10,770
I hope you'll all
open your hearts

613
00:25:10,772 --> 00:25:12,372
and your wallets

614
00:25:12,374 --> 00:25:13,657
for this great cause.

615
00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:14,791
For is there

616
00:25:14,793 --> 00:25:18,078
any more noble pursuit
than the arts?

617
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,412
Science, mathematics,

618
00:25:19,414 --> 00:25:21,381
professional wrestling,
anything besides art.

619
00:25:21,383 --> 00:25:23,333
You're missing the
point about art.

620
00:25:23,335 --> 00:25:24,751
Happy and Toby are in position.

621
00:25:24,753 --> 00:25:26,336
Here, time to go,
time to go.

622
00:25:26,338 --> 00:25:28,338
...literature,
writing, music.

623
00:25:29,174 --> 00:25:31,308
Alarm off

624
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,310
in three, two, one.

625
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:36,263
I'm unlocking the door.

626
00:25:38,517 --> 00:25:41,968
To get to the storage locker,
take the northwest

627
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,854
stairs to the basement level.

628
00:25:45,908 --> 00:25:48,808
Now, to clone Labeaux's
phone, we have to get this

629
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,777
within five feet of him

630
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:52,996
for three
uninterrupted minutes.

631
00:25:52,998 --> 00:25:54,948
Easy. We'll just
stand near him.

632
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,366
Where'd he go?

633
00:25:56,368 --> 00:25:58,585
Oh. I don't know.

634
00:26:05,594 --> 00:26:07,460
Got him.

635
00:26:07,462 --> 00:26:09,379
Oh.
Let's dance next to him.

636
00:26:09,381 --> 00:26:12,799
Come on. There has to be
a more efficient way.

637
00:26:12,801 --> 00:26:15,518
This is the most
efficient way.

638
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,686
I don't dance.

639
00:26:24,396 --> 00:26:26,396
Here's the storage locker.

640
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:28,198
It's a 96-bit triple-encrypted

641
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,816
TD9 lock.
Do you know how

642
00:26:29,818 --> 00:26:32,202
impressed I am when I have
no idea what you're saying?

643
00:26:32,204 --> 00:26:34,738
Remind me to dumb it down
next time.

644
00:26:39,411 --> 00:26:41,077
You ready?

645
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:43,246
- No.
- You need to stay within

646
00:26:43,248 --> 00:26:46,917
five feet of him
for three minutes starting now.

647
00:26:48,003 --> 00:26:49,502
We're a couple, remember?

648
00:26:49,504 --> 00:26:51,588
Do you know where
to put your hands?

649
00:26:53,308 --> 00:26:56,259
You're not pushing
me on a swing.

650
00:26:56,261 --> 00:26:57,844
Lower.

651
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:02,182
Lower.

652
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:05,101
Put your hand lower.

653
00:27:05,103 --> 00:27:07,153
Good.

654
00:27:07,155 --> 00:27:09,439
Keep it there
at the small of my back.

655
00:27:10,892 --> 00:27:12,609
Oh, it's not bad.

656
00:27:12,611 --> 00:27:13,777
It's easy, right?

657
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:15,078
Basic mathematics.

658
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,780
Count the beats,
four-four time,

659
00:27:16,782 --> 00:27:18,615
uh, 76 beats per minute.

660
00:27:18,617 --> 00:27:20,583
That explains it.

661
00:27:23,288 --> 00:27:25,872
We're in.

662
00:27:36,551 --> 00:27:37,717
It's a wine cellar.

663
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:40,887
Do you know why
geniuses can't dance?

664
00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:43,273
'Cause we have
two left brains.

665
00:27:45,227 --> 00:27:47,777
Walter, did you just
make a joke?

666
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:50,647
I used wordplay to
manipulate a common phrase.

667
00:27:50,649 --> 00:27:52,449
Well, it's a start.

668
00:27:52,451 --> 00:27:55,235
I think your experiment
is starting to work.

669
00:27:57,956 --> 00:27:59,823
Download

670
00:27:59,825 --> 00:28:01,841
will complete in 15 seconds.

671
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:09,332
Oh, no. Malfunction!

672
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:11,051
Walter, the cloning device
reset! You have

673
00:28:11,053 --> 00:28:12,585
to start the download
all over again!

674
00:28:12,587 --> 00:28:16,006
We have to keep dancing.
Okay.

675
00:28:22,597 --> 00:28:25,098
May I cut in?

676
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,851
I can't not dance with the most
beautiful woman at my party.

677
00:28:27,853 --> 00:28:29,686
90 seconds.

678
00:28:29,688 --> 00:28:30,520
Stall, Walter.

679
00:28:30,522 --> 00:28:31,771
Oh, well,

680
00:28:31,773 --> 00:28:33,523
if it's all right
with you, honey.

681
00:28:33,525 --> 00:28:34,858
I-I'd be delighted.

682
00:28:37,112 --> 00:28:39,696
I'll-I'll just be
over there, honey.

683
00:28:45,787 --> 00:28:47,704
Okay. How much longer?

684
00:28:47,706 --> 00:28:49,172
80 seconds and counting.

685
00:28:51,293 --> 00:28:53,410
It's a cover.
No one keeps

686
00:28:53,412 --> 00:28:55,111
such fine vintages this cold.

687
00:28:55,113 --> 00:28:57,297
It's not just
a wine cellar.

688
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:59,716
There's got to be a door
or cabinet or something.

689
00:29:03,855 --> 00:29:04,888
How much time left?

690
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,973
30 seconds.
Will you stop asking?

691
00:29:06,975 --> 00:29:08,007
That's, like, the fourth time.

692
00:29:08,009 --> 00:29:09,249
What's gotten into you, anyway?

693
00:29:13,565 --> 00:29:15,532
This was recently installed.

694
00:29:15,534 --> 00:29:19,202
It's got to be hiding
a secret door.

695
00:29:21,823 --> 00:29:23,873
No door.
Come on.

696
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:25,208
Walter, we got it.

697
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,710
Okay.

698
00:29:27,712 --> 00:29:29,412
Excuse me.

699
00:29:29,414 --> 00:29:31,664
May I?

700
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:34,751
<i>Merci.</i>

701
00:29:34,753 --> 00:29:36,503
Okay.

702
00:29:37,339 --> 00:29:38,922
Download complete?

703
00:29:38,924 --> 00:29:40,090
Download complete.

704
00:29:41,593 --> 00:29:43,676
There's nothing behind there.
No.

705
00:29:43,678 --> 00:29:45,345
No.

706
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:49,933
Oh.

707
00:29:51,403 --> 00:29:53,686
It's just a wine cellar.

708
00:29:53,688 --> 00:29:55,271
What was that noise?
Oh, no.

709
00:29:55,273 --> 00:29:57,107
Somebody go
check that out.

710
00:29:57,109 --> 00:29:58,575
Someone's coming.

711
00:29:58,577 --> 00:29:59,742
That's the only exit.

712
00:29:59,744 --> 00:30:00,727
What's going on?

713
00:30:00,729 --> 00:30:03,113
Time to go.

714
00:30:03,115 --> 00:30:04,614
Sylvester, we're about
to get made. Do something!

715
00:30:04,616 --> 00:30:05,982
I'm on it.

716
00:30:09,671 --> 00:30:10,837
Go, go, go, go!

717
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:13,873
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

718
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:15,925
What happened to you guys?

719
00:30:15,927 --> 00:30:17,460
We got out through the kitchen,
I ran into

720
00:30:17,462 --> 00:30:18,595
a giant cake.

721
00:30:18,597 --> 00:30:20,547
I don't want
to talk about it.

722
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:22,632
We didn't find the art,
but we cloned the phone.

723
00:30:22,634 --> 00:30:24,801
Step on it!

724
00:30:33,118 --> 00:30:34,450
It was an easy mistake.

725
00:30:34,452 --> 00:30:36,781
How could I have possibly
known that was a wine cellar?

726
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,834
The painting could be
somewhere else in the house.

727
00:30:39,836 --> 00:30:41,002
No, not anymore.

728
00:30:41,004 --> 00:30:42,870
By now, Labeaux's found
the broken wine bottles,

729
00:30:42,872 --> 00:30:44,872
he knows someone's hacked
into the power.

730
00:30:44,874 --> 00:30:46,040
He knows we're onto him.

731
00:30:46,042 --> 00:30:47,375
He's gonna try
and move that painting fast.

732
00:30:47,377 --> 00:30:49,260
Sylvester?

733
00:30:49,262 --> 00:30:51,128
You search his
call history?

734
00:30:51,624 --> 00:30:53,758
Art world's supposed
to be rarified air,

735
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,259
but instead
it's full of thieves.

736
00:30:55,261 --> 00:30:56,544
This guy stole it
from the museum,

737
00:30:56,546 --> 00:30:58,046
who stole it
from the Mueller family.

738
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,347
This is supposed
to be the intellectual elite?

739
00:30:59,349 --> 00:31:01,215
I thought you didn't
care about art.

740
00:31:01,217 --> 00:31:02,467
I'm faking. Remember?

741
00:31:02,469 --> 00:31:03,668
Sounds awfully real.

742
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,019
Somewhere along the line,

743
00:31:05,021 --> 00:31:06,671
you had a breakthrough.
You're improving.

744
00:31:06,674 --> 00:31:07,890
Okay, Labeaux made

745
00:31:07,891 --> 00:31:10,441
half a dozen calls
to one number in the 48 hours

746
00:31:10,443 --> 00:31:11,943
before the original painting
disappeared.

747
00:31:11,945 --> 00:31:14,312
The name is encrypted,
but I think I can break it.

748
00:31:14,314 --> 00:31:15,229
In how long?

749
00:31:15,231 --> 00:31:17,865
That long.

750
00:31:17,867 --> 00:31:18,900
And I thought I didn't like him

751
00:31:18,902 --> 00:31:20,401
'cause he was a know-it-all
art jerk.

752
00:31:20,403 --> 00:31:22,203
Here's an e-mail
from Labeaux to Paulson with

753
00:31:22,205 --> 00:31:25,323
his bank's routing
and account numbers.

754
00:31:25,325 --> 00:31:27,909
Labeaux provides access
to the fake,

755
00:31:27,911 --> 00:31:30,194
Paulson provides access
to the original.

756
00:31:30,197 --> 00:31:32,181
We didn't find the painting
at Labeaux's because he never

757
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:34,500
had it. Paulson does.
As curator, he could

758
00:31:34,502 --> 00:31:37,386
easily pull this off. He plans
all the museum's exhibits.

759
00:31:37,387 --> 00:31:39,387
The Biermann's worth nine
figures. He wouldn't

760
00:31:39,389 --> 00:31:42,540
move it by air. There are more
security gaps at the docks.

761
00:31:42,542 --> 00:31:44,675
We'll call Cabe from the van.

762
00:31:47,647 --> 00:31:48,896
Paige.

763
00:31:48,898 --> 00:31:50,565
Take this to Hetty.

764
00:31:50,567 --> 00:31:52,734
It can't be discussed over
the phone. She'll understand.

765
00:31:52,736 --> 00:31:54,652
What's this about?
Read it, you'll see.

766
00:31:54,654 --> 00:31:57,488
Oh, I'm gonna need to take your
car as well for the Wi-Fi.

767
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,941
You take the van.
And hurry.

768
00:31:59,943 --> 00:32:02,410
I appreciate it.

769
00:32:02,412 --> 00:32:05,413
I never thought
I'd hear him say that.

770
00:32:05,415 --> 00:32:07,565
Safe to say this is when
the mission went

771
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:09,417
from the frying pan
into the fire.

772
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:10,618
Safe to say anything

773
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,920
you want,
unless it pisses me off.

774
00:32:12,922 --> 00:32:15,123
You're guilty
of breaking and entering,

775
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:16,908
trespassing,
larceny.

776
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:20,845
Do you even think how Walter
puts all your lives at risk?

777
00:32:20,847 --> 00:32:24,198
We're geniuses.
All we do is think.

778
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,184
Ever think about how none of you

779
00:32:26,186 --> 00:32:28,136
have anywhere else to go?

780
00:32:28,138 --> 00:32:29,637
Especially you.

781
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:32,173
Since, from what I can tell,

782
00:32:32,175 --> 00:32:34,342
you have no family to speak of?

783
00:32:34,344 --> 00:32:37,612
There's always a plan,

784
00:32:37,614 --> 00:32:40,815
and we follow it because
we believe in Walter.

785
00:32:40,817 --> 00:32:42,400
And besides,

786
00:32:42,402 --> 00:32:44,535
as soon as we knew the
play with the curator,

787
00:32:44,537 --> 00:32:46,120
we called our superior.

788
00:32:46,122 --> 00:32:48,206
- Paulson? The curator?
- We've got him, yeah,

789
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:50,158
we're on his tail right now.
We surveilled him, followed him

790
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,909
to his house, where he put
the painting in his car.

791
00:32:51,911 --> 00:32:53,294
You went through
private property

792
00:32:53,296 --> 00:32:54,462
without a search warrant.

793
00:32:54,464 --> 00:32:56,464
Anything you saw
is inadmissible in court.

794
00:32:56,466 --> 00:32:57,632
Actually, it is admissible,

795
00:32:57,634 --> 00:32:58,916
because we're not
working at your behest.

796
00:32:58,918 --> 00:33:01,302
We're operating
as private citizens, so the more

797
00:33:01,304 --> 00:33:03,805
we defy you,
the more legal it is.

798
00:33:03,807 --> 00:33:04,972
That's good to know.

799
00:33:04,974 --> 00:33:06,507
We got to remember that
for next time.

800
00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:07,842
All right,
I scanned the manifests

801
00:33:07,844 --> 00:33:09,143
at the San Pedro docks.

802
00:33:09,145 --> 00:33:11,896
There's one ship leaving
for Shanghai in an hour.

803
00:33:11,898 --> 00:33:13,931
And guess who booked
space in the cargo hold.

804
00:33:13,933 --> 00:33:15,266
Paulson.

805
00:33:15,268 --> 00:33:17,819
If that boat leaves
with the painting, it's gone.

806
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:20,154
We're accessing his car's
operational mainframe. Okay,

807
00:33:20,156 --> 00:33:22,106
meet us on
the 6th Street Bridge.

808
00:33:22,108 --> 00:33:23,524
We'll cut
Paulson's engine.

809
00:33:23,526 --> 00:33:25,276
All you have to do
is arrest him.

810
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:27,195
You'll find the stolen painting
in the trunk.

811
00:33:27,197 --> 00:33:29,030
No drama, no high-speed chase,
no risk.

812
00:33:29,032 --> 00:33:30,331
Okay, but

813
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:31,782
do not engage.

814
00:33:31,784 --> 00:33:33,501
We don't want
to endanger the public.

815
00:33:33,503 --> 00:33:35,536
We'll keep it safe.
Just like the painting.

816
00:33:38,174 --> 00:33:39,841
Use the built-in Wi-Fi.

817
00:33:41,344 --> 00:33:43,211
Got full bars.

818
00:33:43,213 --> 00:33:44,213
We're in.

819
00:33:44,214 --> 00:33:46,631
We got control
of his car.

820
00:33:51,838 --> 00:33:53,721
Cutting engine power.

821
00:34:05,068 --> 00:34:06,734
Raising engine temp.

822
00:34:24,137 --> 00:34:26,053
You're under arrest.

823
00:34:26,055 --> 00:34:28,005
Painting's in the trunk.

824
00:34:29,759 --> 00:34:31,092
Agents are
en route,

825
00:34:31,094 --> 00:34:32,393
they'll take it
to the museum.

826
00:34:32,395 --> 00:34:35,179
Another unit is apprehending
Labeaux right now.

827
00:34:35,181 --> 00:34:36,681
Well done, guys.

828
00:34:36,683 --> 00:34:39,233
You sure know your tech.

829
00:34:51,364 --> 00:34:52,604
Oh, no, the painting.

830
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:58,536
That might be our fault.

831
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:07,770
Something must've gone wrong
with the frequency

832
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:10,153
- or the F6 diode or...
- I don't care. What I

833
00:35:10,155 --> 00:35:13,440
care about is this.

834
00:35:13,442 --> 00:35:16,360
And you destroyed a
$100 million painting.

835
00:35:22,001 --> 00:35:23,333
Where are you going?

836
00:35:23,335 --> 00:35:26,787
Well, I told you the whole
story, so we're done.

837
00:35:26,789 --> 00:35:29,423
Forensic gave me
your cloning device.

838
00:35:30,593 --> 00:35:34,011
I carried it in my
bag, I jostled it.

839
00:35:34,013 --> 00:35:36,797
I even dropped
it. Not once

840
00:35:36,799 --> 00:35:39,099
did the device
accidentally reset.

841
00:35:40,102 --> 00:35:43,270
Which is why
I find it odd

842
00:35:43,272 --> 00:35:46,139
that it got reset while
you were dancing with Paige.

843
00:35:46,141 --> 00:35:49,059
It was probably
some radio wave interference.

844
00:35:49,061 --> 00:35:51,278
Know what I really
think happened?

845
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,563
You enjoyed dancing with Paige.

846
00:35:53,565 --> 00:35:56,483
Holding her.
Being close.

847
00:35:56,485 --> 00:35:58,235
You didn't want it to stop,

848
00:35:58,237 --> 00:36:00,687
so you reset the
device yourself.

849
00:36:04,743 --> 00:36:05,809
<i>You risked</i>

850
00:36:05,811 --> 00:36:07,661
the entire mission

851
00:36:07,663 --> 00:36:09,963
to dance with her
for 30 more seconds.

852
00:36:09,965 --> 00:36:13,000
I would never
jeopardize a mission.

853
00:36:13,002 --> 00:36:15,552
I have met with
all of your team.

854
00:36:15,554 --> 00:36:17,671
They rely on you,
they defend you.

855
00:36:17,673 --> 00:36:19,673
They're brilliant,
they're talented,

856
00:36:19,675 --> 00:36:22,175
and all I've ever tried
to do is protect them.

857
00:36:22,177 --> 00:36:24,511
Together we can do things
that no one else can do.

858
00:36:24,513 --> 00:36:27,097
And it's up to you to decide
whether you'll allow us

859
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:29,650
to keep doing that.
Now, excuse me.

860
00:36:32,021 --> 00:36:34,104
Okay, so I ran
the potentialities, and the

861
00:36:34,106 --> 00:36:37,335
likelihood of us passing
this test is very low.

862
00:36:37,336 --> 00:36:40,077
All right, the good news is,
either way, we got this.

863
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,578
It would pair
beautifully with

864
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,364
a leg of lamb, but given
our higher-than-normal

865
00:36:44,366 --> 00:36:47,417
anxiety levels, I think we
should pop this open right now.

866
00:36:49,004 --> 00:36:50,704
Guys.

867
00:36:55,878 --> 00:36:57,210
You passed.

868
00:36:57,212 --> 00:36:58,462
Aah!
Oh.

869
00:36:58,464 --> 00:37:00,047
Yeah!

870
00:37:00,049 --> 00:37:02,849
Give me some.
Yeah, let's go pop this.

871
00:37:02,851 --> 00:37:04,518
Good idea.

872
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,887
Enjoy.

873
00:37:08,273 --> 00:37:10,407
So, um...

874
00:37:11,443 --> 00:37:13,143
Dr. Davis thinks we're okay?

875
00:37:13,145 --> 00:37:15,195
Well, I wouldn't go
that far. She passed you

876
00:37:15,197 --> 00:37:18,198
because, and I quote,

877
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,817
“Mr. O'Brien seems
to believe that lying

878
00:37:20,819 --> 00:37:23,236
“to a federal psychologist
is justified

879
00:37:23,238 --> 00:37:25,489
“so long as the job is done.

880
00:37:25,491 --> 00:37:27,908
“However,
his deeper motivation

881
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,543
“stems not, as he states,

882
00:37:29,545 --> 00:37:31,962
“from a desire
to complete his mission,

883
00:37:31,964 --> 00:37:35,132
“but from empathy
for his team members.

884
00:37:35,134 --> 00:37:37,134
“He has created for himself

885
00:37:37,136 --> 00:37:38,752
“a purpose,

886
00:37:38,754 --> 00:37:40,003
“and for each of them,

887
00:37:40,005 --> 00:37:41,888
“a family.

888
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:44,091
“A safe haven.

889
00:37:44,093 --> 00:37:47,094
A place to reach
their potential”"

890
00:37:48,397 --> 00:37:49,679
Doesn't sound like you.

891
00:37:50,766 --> 00:37:52,065
That hurts.

892
00:37:52,067 --> 00:37:53,767
I doubt that.

893
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:55,569
But it got me thinking
about some things

894
00:37:55,571 --> 00:37:56,653
that didn't make sense.

895
00:37:56,655 --> 00:37:58,488
Like when you
hacked Paulson's car

896
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:01,274
and it didn't exactly
work as planned.

897
00:38:01,276 --> 00:38:03,276
Well, technology's
not always reliable.

898
00:38:03,278 --> 00:38:05,028
It is when you
guys do it.

899
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,830
So then I went down
to the evidence locker

900
00:38:06,832 --> 00:38:08,915
to look for the fake
painting. Couldn't find it.

901
00:38:08,917 --> 00:38:10,751
I don't know
how we'll build

902
00:38:10,753 --> 00:38:13,086
a case against Paulson
and Labeaux without it.

903
00:38:13,088 --> 00:38:14,755
This isn't the first time
they've done this.

904
00:38:14,757 --> 00:38:17,457
Their records will lead you to
all of their other stolen art.

905
00:38:17,459 --> 00:38:19,126
Your case will be airtight.

906
00:38:19,128 --> 00:38:21,628
And if I had Forensics test
the ashes of that painting,

907
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,296
would it be the fake
or the original?

908
00:38:23,298 --> 00:38:25,348
Forensics won't
reveal a thing about

909
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,600
the painting's authenticity,

910
00:38:26,602 --> 00:38:29,469
<i>'cause it was completely</i>
<i>destroyed in the fire.</i>

911
00:38:42,284 --> 00:38:44,151
And if I were to call
the Mueller family,

912
00:38:44,153 --> 00:38:46,119
would they be
particularly happy?

913
00:38:48,056 --> 00:38:49,706
<i>Danke.</i>

914
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:51,241
Thank you.

915
00:38:51,243 --> 00:38:52,659
Let's keep this
between us.

916
00:38:52,661 --> 00:38:54,978
Oh, don't hang it near
your window, Mrs. Mueller.

917
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,164
I'll walk you out.

918
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,641
No one will know about this?
Not Interpol.

919
00:39:07,643 --> 00:39:09,643
Not Cabe. No one.

920
00:39:09,645 --> 00:39:11,311
Before, you said

921
00:39:11,313 --> 00:39:13,930
that painting
was meaningless.

922
00:39:13,932 --> 00:39:15,398
Now you broke the law

923
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,735
to return it to its
rightful owner.

924
00:39:18,737 --> 00:39:21,605
I grew to appreciate its, uh...

925
00:39:21,607 --> 00:39:23,740
subtle beauty and

926
00:39:23,742 --> 00:39:25,692
lyrical composition.

927
00:39:26,829 --> 00:39:29,412
Fine. I still don't get it.
You know,

928
00:39:29,414 --> 00:39:31,865
I saw how Duke Guillaume

929
00:39:31,867 --> 00:39:34,084
looked at Countess Stephanie.

930
00:39:34,086 --> 00:39:36,570
And I saw
the way you

931
00:39:36,572 --> 00:39:38,371
looked at Paige.

932
00:39:38,373 --> 00:39:41,374
Something made
you understand

933
00:39:41,376 --> 00:39:44,294
that family's connection
to the painting.

934
00:39:44,296 --> 00:39:46,296
Something.

935
00:39:50,802 --> 00:39:53,019
Or someone.

936
00:39:59,378 --> 00:40:01,561
Everything happened
like I said it did.

937
00:40:03,115 --> 00:40:04,898
For real.

938
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:14,124
<i>Hello? They said</i>
<i>we should come in here.</i>

939
00:40:14,126 --> 00:40:16,293
Come on.

940
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:18,912
Hello?

941
00:40:21,383 --> 00:40:23,967
I guess you don't
hate Halloween after all.

942
00:40:23,969 --> 00:40:26,419
Oh, we still hate it.
But we love Ralph.

943
00:40:26,421 --> 00:40:28,889
We were hoping we could tag
along to your school party.

944
00:40:28,891 --> 00:40:31,224
Hmm.

945
00:40:31,226 --> 00:40:33,643
My highly tuned
facial recognition skills

946
00:40:33,645 --> 00:40:35,629
tell me that is a yes.

947
00:40:35,631 --> 00:40:37,097
Hmm. All right, let me guess

948
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:38,348
who's who.

949
00:40:39,518 --> 00:40:40,984
Super Fun Guy.

950
00:40:40,986 --> 00:40:42,936
No surprises
there.

951
00:40:42,938 --> 00:40:45,405
Uh...

952
00:40:45,407 --> 00:40:46,740
Sigmund Freud?

953
00:40:46,742 --> 00:40:48,441
Ah, precisely.

954
00:40:48,443 --> 00:40:50,293
Which means
I'm dressed as a hack.

955
00:40:51,246 --> 00:40:54,030
Meow.
Every girl does that costume.

956
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,416
And it's still hot.

957
00:41:02,591 --> 00:41:03,873
I give up.

958
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:05,008
Agent Cabe Gallo.

959
00:41:06,628 --> 00:41:08,345
Okay.
We also cooked

960
00:41:08,347 --> 00:41:12,299
something up for you.
You come with us, big man.

961
00:41:13,302 --> 00:41:14,884
Oh.

962
00:41:17,889 --> 00:41:19,472
So let me get
something straight.

963
00:41:19,474 --> 00:41:21,775
Art makes you feel
nothing, yet you

964
00:41:21,777 --> 00:41:24,394
lied to your superiors
and risked your job

965
00:41:24,396 --> 00:41:26,646
in order for us to return
the painting to its

966
00:41:26,648 --> 00:41:27,814
rightful heirs.

967
00:41:27,816 --> 00:41:30,867
You also think
Halloween is nonsensical.

968
00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:32,869
Mm-hmm.
And yet you

969
00:41:32,871 --> 00:41:34,821
took time off work
to get dressed up

970
00:41:34,823 --> 00:41:37,741
and go to Ralph's party.

971
00:41:39,494 --> 00:41:42,495
For a guy who says
he has no feelings,

972
00:41:42,497 --> 00:41:44,130
you sure are sweet.

973
00:41:44,132 --> 00:41:46,349
Eh, it's just a costume.

974
00:41:49,421 --> 00:41:51,137
Oh, my God,

975
00:41:51,139 --> 00:41:52,505
that's the perfect costume.

976
00:41:52,507 --> 00:41:53,673
Yeah.

977
00:41:53,675 --> 00:41:56,810
I thought you'd like it.
Hey, come on, we got

978
00:41:56,812 --> 00:41:57,844
a party to catch.

979
00:41:57,846 --> 00:42:00,764
You know, Ralph, uh,

980
00:42:00,766 --> 00:42:02,065
Halloween started off as a day

981
00:42:02,067 --> 00:42:04,351
to ward off evil spirits.
Isn't that stupid?

982
00:42:04,353 --> 00:42:06,019
Yeah.
Yeah.

983
00:42:06,021 --> 00:42:08,021
But who cares?
Let's go get some candy.
