00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,957
Okay.

Poodle.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,626
Yikes.

5
00:00:09,628 --> 00:00:11,695
What's this?
Establishing Cabe's

00:00:11,697 --> 00:00:12,829
personality baseline.

7
00:00:12,831 --> 00:00:14,097
Spider.

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:15,432
<font color="#D900D9">(chuckles)</font></font> Wow.

9
00:00:15,434 --> 00:00:16,499
I'm researching the use

10
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:19,369
of behaviorism
into predicting the future.

11
00:00:19,371 --> 00:00:21,805
I say if you know
the psychological ground floor

12
00:00:21,807 --> 00:00:23,573
of a subject,
its tendencies or its maladies,

13
00:00:23,575 --> 00:00:27,944
I'm postulating you can
predict future behavior.

14
00:00:27,946 --> 00:00:29,646
Test will be if he pulls
another shocked face,

15
00:00:29,648 --> 00:00:32,415
will he see my foot flying
toward his butt?

16
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:34,050
I'll expect it.

17
00:00:34,052 --> 00:00:35,719
<font color="#ff8000">PAIGE:</font> Why the sudden interest
in predicting the future?

18
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:37,387
Where's Walter?

19
00:00:37,389 --> 00:00:39,255
He's at the hospital,
visiting Megan.

20
00:00:39,257 --> 00:00:40,457
Oh, there

21
00:00:40,459 --> 00:00:41,658
a connection there?

22
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,959
Megan and predicting the future?

23
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:46,129
Paige, you just leave
the shrinking to me.

24
00:00:48,934 --> 00:00:50,634
When did this begin?

25
00:00:50,636 --> 00:00:53,403
A few days ago.

26
00:00:54,406 --> 00:00:56,072
Respiratory infection,

27
00:00:56,074 --> 00:00:58,408
for someone with MS, is very...

28
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,676
concerning.

29
00:00:59,678 --> 00:01:02,612
Did the doctors give you
an antibiotic cocktail?

30
00:01:02,614 --> 00:01:05,515
They just put me on one.

31
00:01:05,517 --> 00:01:08,785
Plus 100 milligrams
of prednisone.

32
00:01:08,787 --> 00:01:10,654
You know, an infection like
this can lead to sepsis

33
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,855
or low blood pressure?

34
00:01:11,857 --> 00:01:13,289
Yes, Walter.
Yeah.

35
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:14,658
And I'm on several I.V. drips

36
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,826
to make
my heart beat harder.

37
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:17,927
Did they give you, uh...

38
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:19,596
I knew the minute I told you,

39
00:01:19,598 --> 00:01:21,097
you would start
spouting research

40
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:22,265
and second-guessing.

41
00:01:22,267 --> 00:01:25,068
Do I do that?

42
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:29,873
It's under control.

43
00:01:31,977 --> 00:01:33,376
Okay, get some rest.

44
00:01:33,378 --> 00:01:34,544
Check in later.

45
00:01:34,546 --> 00:01:37,113
Okay.

46
00:01:37,115 --> 00:01:39,249
<font color="#ff8000">WALTER:</font>
You know, I'm, uh...

47
00:01:39,251 --> 00:01:41,618
I'm baffled that you didn't

48
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,620
inform me
of her condition sooner.

49
00:01:43,622 --> 00:01:45,221
This only started
a few days ago,

50
00:01:45,223 --> 00:01:46,189
and Megan didn't want you

51
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:47,824
to divert your attention
over to her.

52
00:01:47,826 --> 00:01:49,659
I need more time.

53
00:01:49,661 --> 00:01:51,961
And in a few weeks,
I'll have the rocket finished

54
00:01:51,963 --> 00:01:53,430
and submitted
to the Karman Prize.

55
00:01:53,432 --> 00:01:54,998
And then when I win,
I'll have an influx

56
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,133
of 50 million in cash
to buy equipment

57
00:01:57,135 --> 00:01:59,402
to finish my research to save her.
Walter,

58
00:01:59,404 --> 00:02:01,404
the doctors aren't discussing
her condition in terms of weeks.

59
00:02:01,406 --> 00:02:03,239
We don't give in.
No, you stay with her today,

60
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:05,308
and you make sure that
her treatment stays aggressive.

61
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,509
Isn't that up to Megan?

62
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:08,111
Any sign that her blood pressure
is getting too low,

63
00:02:08,113 --> 00:02:10,413
then you tell them
to increase her meds

64
00:02:10,415 --> 00:02:11,681
or add a new agent
like phenylephrine.

65
00:02:11,683 --> 00:02:12,716
Are you listening to me?

66
00:02:12,718 --> 00:02:14,784
Can we take a breath
and think about her

67
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:16,052
and her quality of life?

68
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:17,887
More important...

69
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:19,556
is preserving her life

70
00:02:19,558 --> 00:02:21,091
and her mind.

71
00:02:23,261 --> 00:02:25,361
We do whatever it takes.

72
00:02:25,363 --> 00:02:28,832
Promise me you will do
the right thing.

73
00:02:28,834 --> 00:02:31,367
I promise.

74
00:02:31,369 --> 00:02:33,303
All right.

75
00:02:33,305 --> 00:02:36,039
<i>So, the initial plan,</i>

76
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,575
uh, for the project budgeted

77
00:02:38,577 --> 00:02:41,077
at 15 months,

78
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:43,413
but given Megan's condition,
it will have to be accelerated

79
00:02:43,415 --> 00:02:45,515
to being underway within three,

80
00:02:45,517 --> 00:02:48,051
and then Megan's life
will be saved.

81
00:02:50,822 --> 00:02:52,522
Questions?

82
00:02:52,524 --> 00:02:54,090
Yes?

83
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:56,626
Well, what exactly is the plan
to save her life?

84
00:02:56,628 --> 00:02:57,727
Yes.

85
00:02:57,729 --> 00:02:59,496
So, uh, I am going
to download her brain,

86
00:02:59,498 --> 00:03:01,131
her thoughts,
her consciousness, her memories,

87
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:02,132
preserve them digitally,

88
00:03:02,134 --> 00:03:04,534
until I can find another vessel

89
00:03:04,536 --> 00:03:06,736
after her body fails.

90
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:07,837
Not in three months.

91
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:09,339
Maybe 20 years.

92
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:10,540
Megan does not have that long.

93
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:11,641
So, in order

94
00:03:11,643 --> 00:03:13,610
to save her mind,
I need to build something

95
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:15,111
that does not exist.

96
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:17,147
It's a-a data server
with the capacity

97
00:03:17,149 --> 00:03:19,382
to store the contents
of the human brain.

98
00:03:19,384 --> 00:03:22,218
That's at least 50 petabytes
of storage capacity.

99
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,654
The immediate issue is funding.

100
00:03:24,656 --> 00:03:26,656
The Karman prize, uh,
won't judge for months,

101
00:03:26,658 --> 00:03:28,258
so I need starter capital,

102
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,994
which means I'll have
to take on other jobs,

103
00:03:30,996 --> 00:03:32,328
so I may not be here.

104
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,931
We all want to do anything
we can to help, Walter, but...

105
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:38,768
I think our primary question is
how are you doing emotionally?

106
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,803
Oh, I'm fine.

107
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:41,037
I figure it's gonna run me

108
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,239
a million per petabyte.
About that.

109
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:44,941
So I'm gonna go call
our wealthiest clients,

110
00:03:44,943 --> 00:03:46,309
see what I can't drum up.

111
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:48,645
He's officially gone
through the looking glass.

112
00:03:48,647 --> 00:03:50,713
I don't like the way
he's handling this.

113
00:03:50,715 --> 00:03:53,483
I don't think any of them are
gonna be able to handle it.

114
00:03:53,485 --> 00:03:54,951
I think that...

115
00:03:54,953 --> 00:03:56,953
What?

116
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,223
Who the hell is that?

117
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:01,858
Identify yourself.

118
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,993
Mark Willis,
Central Intelligence.

119
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:05,161
CIA.

120
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:06,863
Explains how he came
in like a cloud.

121
00:04:06,865 --> 00:04:08,031
Dark cloud.

122
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:10,066
Homeland's agreed to lend out
Scorpion's services

123
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:11,668
to my unit.

124
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,303
Oh, lucky us.

125
00:04:13,305 --> 00:04:15,271
For a significant payday.

126
00:04:15,273 --> 00:04:17,674
We're listening.

127
00:04:17,676 --> 00:04:19,909
This is the 27B/6.

128
00:04:19,911 --> 00:04:22,278
Brand-new flagship of an airline

129
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,513
known as Integrity Airlines.

130
00:04:23,515 --> 00:04:24,814
No such thing.

131
00:04:24,816 --> 00:04:26,816
It's top-secret,
servicing only the CIA.

132
00:04:26,818 --> 00:04:28,251
You guys have
a secret airline?

133
00:04:28,253 --> 00:04:29,819
What kind of snacks
are we talking?

134
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:31,020
Or is that a secret, too?

135
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:32,722
Integrity functions
independently

136
00:04:32,724 --> 00:04:35,024
of any commercial or
military frequency.

137
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:36,359
We have our own call signs,

138
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:38,528
and we are
undetectable by radar.

139
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,796
Nine hours ago,

140
00:04:39,798 --> 00:04:42,999
this plane was on a routine
mission and went missing.

141
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:44,067
Define routine.

142
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:45,168
Running money,

143
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,636
weapons, copy machines

144
00:04:46,638 --> 00:04:49,038
or other tools of
country-building or takeover.

145
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,406
What?

146
00:04:50,408 --> 00:04:53,109
That's not how the CIA
would use a secret plane?

147
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:54,677
Last location ping?

148
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:56,012
Over Fort Collins, Colorado.

149
00:04:56,014 --> 00:04:58,848
There's no indication of
a crash and no response

150
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,783
to radio calls.
So hijacked?

151
00:05:00,785 --> 00:05:02,552
Doubtful.
Then the pilot stole it.

152
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:06,256
Our men, highly trained,
with spotless records.

153
00:05:06,258 --> 00:05:07,390
Sly, anything?

154
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:08,825
<font color="#ff8000">SYLVESTER:</font>
A plane heading west

155
00:05:08,827 --> 00:05:10,627
wouldn't double back
and risk suspicion

156
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:12,328
by pinging
the same location twice.

157
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,465
Okay, I'm running an analysis
on the sound package

158
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:17,100
from the last ping.

159
00:05:17,102 --> 00:05:20,370
The plane was tilting down
when the last ping registered.

160
00:05:20,372 --> 00:05:22,372
A plane of that weight,
cruising at that speed,

161
00:05:22,374 --> 00:05:25,208
yields a possible
landing location of...

162
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:27,210
Oh, my God.

163
00:05:27,212 --> 00:05:28,811
That's Coughlan Air Force Base.
That's Area 51.

164
00:05:28,813 --> 00:05:32,081
Secret spy mission
in Area 51-- spooky.

165
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,516

00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,726
so we determine his identity

323
00:11:42,728 --> 00:11:44,361
through the base's
medical records

324
00:11:44,363 --> 00:11:46,130
and we track down
where he works on the base

325
00:11:46,132 --> 00:11:47,765
in order to
rescue him.

326
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:49,066
What if they already
got their target?

327
00:11:49,068 --> 00:11:50,768
The CIA agents
got here before us.

328
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,436
Could be six hours,
could be 30 minutes.

329
00:11:52,438 --> 00:11:53,904
<font color="#ff8000">CABE:</font> But we still don't know
how they're getting on the base.

330
00:11:53,906 --> 00:11:55,940
If they're tunneling,
that's gonna take a while.

331
00:11:55,942 --> 00:11:57,508
Subterfuge,
also a time suck.

332
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,443
We got a shot
at shutting this thing down.

333
00:11:59,445 --> 00:12:01,045
Yeah, but because of
the cone of silence,

334
00:12:01,047 --> 00:12:03,314
we can't just hack the base's
medical records externally,

335
00:12:03,316 --> 00:12:04,481
so we're heading in.

336
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:05,950
Now, you guys find him,

337
00:12:05,952 --> 00:12:07,718
warn him and get him to safety.

338
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,286
While you're just
catching some rays?

339
00:12:09,288 --> 00:12:10,588
Well, I'm happy to go,

340
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,489
but who is gonna hack
the plane's guidance system

341
00:12:12,491 --> 00:12:13,724
to find its likely destination?

342
00:12:13,726 --> 00:12:15,125
You know, the other
half of our job?

343
00:12:15,127 --> 00:12:16,527
I'll keep guard in case
the bad guys come back.

344
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:18,262
How do we break in?

345
00:12:18,264 --> 00:12:20,998
With these.

346
00:12:22,568 --> 00:12:24,802
Okay, we aim the plane's
reflective panels

347
00:12:24,804 --> 00:12:26,670
into my magnifying glass.

348
00:12:26,672 --> 00:12:28,239
The heat will be
the equivalent

349
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:29,373
of 100 solar panels

350
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,375
focused on an area
the size of a playing card,

351
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:33,611
which I will aim directly

352
00:12:33,613 --> 00:12:36,113
at the tire
of a passing delivery truck.

353
00:12:36,115 --> 00:12:38,182
Boom goes the tire.

354
00:12:38,184 --> 00:12:39,516
And while the driver's
changing it,

355
00:12:39,518 --> 00:12:41,118
he gains extra cargo.
And since this is the only road

356
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,754
into the base,
one is bound to come along soon.

357
00:12:43,756 --> 00:12:44,955
Until then, we wait.

358
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:47,825
Disgusting.

359
00:12:47,827 --> 00:12:50,027
Dental hygiene is beautiful.

362

363
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:01,405
look over here:

364
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:03,540
Domestic flight paths

365
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:06,744
circling over L.A.,
DC and Chicago.

366
00:13:06,746 --> 00:13:08,545
Now why is a CIA plane

367
00:13:08,547 --> 00:13:11,081
flying repeatedly
over U.S. cities? Huh?

368
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,250
You're being paid to find
a final destination.

369
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:14,652
Find it and let's
clear out of here.

370
00:13:14,654 --> 00:13:17,121
And when you're done, son,

371
00:13:17,123 --> 00:13:19,089
I want to talk to you
about your sister

372
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:21,325
and what may be coming.

373
00:13:21,327 --> 00:13:23,027
Busy.

374
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:28,532
Uh, I know
you're concerned

375
00:13:28,534 --> 00:13:30,234
about Walt on
the Megan thing.

376
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:33,470
“The Megan thing”?
Her illness?

377
00:13:33,472 --> 00:13:35,606
Uh...

378
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:36,674
He'll work through it.

379
00:13:36,676 --> 00:13:37,675
We all will.

380
00:13:37,677 --> 00:13:38,776
It is what it is.

381
00:13:38,778 --> 00:13:40,544
That's a little chilly.

382
00:13:40,546 --> 00:13:42,279
My mother died
the day I was born.

383
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:44,682
Death has always been
a part of my life.

384
00:13:44,684 --> 00:13:47,918
Now, Sylvester... he's going
to be a basket case.

385
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,521
He won't be able to handle it
as well as the rest of us.

386
00:13:50,523 --> 00:13:53,390
You may consider
it's okay to just...

387
00:13:53,392 --> 00:13:55,993
think about it and be sad.

388
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,863
Or just don't think about it.

389
00:13:59,865 --> 00:14:00,898

390

The phenylephrine
didn't clear your lungs

395

the way we had hoped.

396
00:14:36,202 --> 00:14:37,134
So...

397
00:14:37,136 --> 00:14:39,169
the aggressive treatment
would be...?

398
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:40,537
Intubation.

399
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:42,272

I have to encourage you

409
00:15:09,802 --> 00:15:11,268
to be aggressive.

410
00:15:12,605 --> 00:15:14,605
You have to stop being

00:15:14,607 --> 00:15:17,341
a conduit to my brother

412
00:15:17,343 --> 00:15:20,778
and be the man that I love.

Copy that!

00:15:48,707 --> 00:15:50,307
is access the base intranet

418
00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:52,242
and hack into
their medical records.

419
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:53,410
Right. Easy.

420
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:55,012
Just walk in an office
and find a computer.

421
00:15:55,014 --> 00:15:57,748
No, we can connect via
a peripheral system.

422
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,350
Like the sprinkler

423
00:16:00,352 --> 00:16:01,985
The sewer system.

but their medical records
are tight as a drum.

428
00:16:12,364 --> 00:16:13,897
And with our best
hackers elsewhere,

429
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:15,432
this could take
hours. Days.

430
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:17,768
So we're stuck in a sewer
for no good reason?

431
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,970
Unless we can call
Sly to hack it.

432

Private branch exchange.

434
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:25,342
They work best
on ground start trunks,

435
00:16:25,344 --> 00:16:26,810
if the intercom is
connected to an outside line.

Dr. Ivan Zahn.

460
00:17:12,892 --> 00:17:15,692
Uzbek national
who defected 13 years ago.

461
00:17:15,694 --> 00:17:18,195
He currently leads a team

in the computer
engineering division.

and storage.

465

to be the best in his field.

466
00:17:26,205 --> 00:17:27,471
Okay, based on
his scientific field,

467

Dr. Zahn's office is located

468
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:30,674
in Laboratory Five of “C” Wing.

469
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:32,543
Sly, hang in there.
Okay.

470
00:17:33,946 --> 00:17:35,512
Honestly, I think I'm
figuring this place out.

so scared of it.

Come up on a stairwell,

00:17:38,784 --> 00:17:41,051
which opens to a door
just outside “C” Wing.

474
00:17:41,053 --> 00:17:42,386
Say a place is full of secrets

475
00:17:42,388 --> 00:17:43,787
and imagination takes over.

00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:45,556
Hence, little green men.
Your point?

482
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:57,868
I have an envelope
in my pocket predicting this.

483
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:02,506
Okay, almost into
the navigation system.

484
00:18:02,508 --> 00:18:03,941
A couple more moments,

485
00:18:03,943 --> 00:18:07,110
we will know
the plane's destination.

486
00:18:07,112 --> 00:18:10,214
Know that we're here
for Megan.

487
00:18:10,216 --> 00:18:13,283
But in the end, what if
that's just not enough?

488
00:18:13,285 --> 00:18:15,219
Almost finished.

489
00:18:15,221 --> 00:18:17,821
I don't want you to go
into this flat-footed.

490
00:18:17,823 --> 00:18:19,556
Could take you years
to get over.

491
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:21,925
I know that you've suffered
tremendous loss,

492
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:24,294
but this is different.

493
00:18:24,296 --> 00:18:26,129
There's time to find a solution.

494
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,867
You got something to say
to Megan, you should say it.

495
00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:33,503
Spend your time
making memories.

496
00:18:33,505 --> 00:18:36,340
Don't bury yourself in
“solutions” that may not work.

And I'm certain
it will work.

of Megan: me.

Let's clear out
of this plane now.

00:18:58,631 --> 00:19:00,530
Walter, what's
the holdup?

505
00:19:00,532 --> 00:19:02,566
Hold on, hold on,
hold on.

506
00:19:02,568 --> 00:19:04,901

Oh, God...

509
00:19:08,207 --> 00:19:10,774
Storage capacity on this
is almost two petabytes.

510
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:14,111
Shouldn't be possible
for a machine this small.

511
00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:16,313
It's ten years ahead of
anything else on the market.

512
00:19:17,816 --> 00:19:19,516

513

the camera equipment Happy saw?

515
00:19:23,022 --> 00:19:26,189
This plane is used
to spy on American cities.

516
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,595
And they're flying in secret
back to Area 51.

517
00:19:31,597 --> 00:19:34,998
It's a safe bet that technology
was developed there.

518
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,900
By the guy
that they're looking to kidnap.

519
00:19:36,902 --> 00:19:38,502
With this prototype
and the inventor,

520
00:19:38,504 --> 00:19:39,936
they could make a whole
fleet of planes.

521
00:19:39,938 --> 00:19:41,371
Sell it to every
hostile government

Agent Cabe Gallo's
right over that ridge.

529
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,540
He'll confirm
we're with Homeland.

530
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:42,175
These cuffs are a little tight.
Is that necessary?

531
00:20:42,177 --> 00:20:43,777
Please shut up, sir!

532
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:45,579
Okay, did you even bother
checking on Dr. Zahn?

533
00:20:45,581 --> 00:20:46,880
The man is in danger.

534
00:20:46,882 --> 00:20:49,516
Doctor's on base some weeks,
gone for others.

535
00:20:49,518 --> 00:20:51,284
But I do appreciate your attempt

536
00:20:51,286 --> 00:20:53,420
to bolster
this cockamamie story.

537
00:20:53,422 --> 00:20:55,055
You'll be eating that tone soon.

538
00:21:00,229 --> 00:21:01,962
They were here an hour ago.

539
00:21:01,964 --> 00:21:03,563

542
00:21:07,236 --> 00:21:09,269
Okay, if they are,
things have gone severely south.

543
00:21:09,271 --> 00:21:10,504
We need to find them.

544
00:21:10,506 --> 00:21:11,671
We can't lose time.

545
00:21:11,673 --> 00:21:13,473
Oh, you'll have plenty
of time in the brig.

I-I can see how this may
look bad, but it's the truth.

547

I'm not trying to discount
your story, Doctor.

548
00:21:17,146 --> 00:21:21,181
This base has seen its share
of run-ins with rogue men.

559
00:21:41,804 --> 00:21:44,704
Homeland team known as Scorpion

560
00:21:44,706 --> 00:21:47,174
are updating data servers
in Barstow.

561
00:21:48,043 --> 00:21:49,075
So who the hell are you?

562
00:21:49,077 --> 00:21:49,976
We're Scorpion.

563
00:21:49,978 --> 00:21:51,411
I'm a world-renowned
behaviorist.

564
00:21:51,413 --> 00:21:52,779

170.

566
00:21:54,383 --> 00:21:55,715
Barstow was our cover story.

567
00:21:55,717 --> 00:21:56,817
It was the CIA's idea.

568
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:58,452
Right.

569
00:21:58,454 --> 00:21:59,619

Heartbeat's strong.

572
00:22:08,063 --> 00:22:09,563
He's sedated but alive.

573
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:13,166
Luckily, this
was designed

574
00:22:13,168 --> 00:22:16,236
to keep us out, not in.

575
00:22:16,238 --> 00:22:18,238
We got to take control
of this plane.

576
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,806
That means taking out one
of the agents in the cockpit

577
00:22:19,808 --> 00:22:21,608
and forcing the other one
to fly us back to Coughlan.

578
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:22,809
Yeah.

579
00:22:28,484 --> 00:22:30,484
Easier if we
divide and conquer.

580
00:22:30,486 --> 00:22:32,853
I could reprogram
the plane's flight path

581
00:22:32,855 --> 00:22:34,754
from this control panel,

582
00:22:34,756 --> 00:22:36,756

I could use a cell phone

There's literally
an army sitting outside.

and go to the roof
where the comm dishes are.

618
00:24:19,361 --> 00:24:20,727
Then we can knock out a dish,

poke out a tiny hole in the

00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:59,699
It's time to turn
this plane around.

638
00:24:59,701 --> 00:25:01,401
Okay.
Wait at the panel.

647
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:50,250

653
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:14,507
That's not gonna happen.

654
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:16,509
Either this plane lands
in Uzbekistan

655

or it crashes
into a mountain.

656
00:26:17,946 --> 00:26:19,212
The autopilot I programmed

657
00:26:19,214 --> 00:26:20,980
has us heading straight
into Boundary Peak.

I'd drop the weapon.

00:26:25,921 --> 00:26:27,787
I can override his passcode

664
00:26:39,534 --> 00:26:41,501
It is-- I switched the antenna
from receiver mode to broadcast.

665
00:26:41,503 --> 00:26:44,471
It's channeling energy straight
from the battery into the lock.

666
00:26:44,473 --> 00:26:45,805
Well, how do you know
it's working?

667
00:26:45,807 --> 00:26:48,441

00:27:19,641 --> 00:27:21,274
Well, there's microwaves
up here, too!

673
00:27:21,276 --> 00:27:23,343
We can use the phone
to short-circuit the dish.

674
00:27:23,345 --> 00:27:25,411
No, the dishes aren't
electromagnetic!

675
00:27:25,413 --> 00:27:28,748
Then take it off broadcast mode,
cut off its transmissions,

676
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,017
so we can call Sylvester.
<font color="#ff8000">HAPPY:</font> Uh, no, the best way

677

I'm calling Sly.

681
00:27:42,164 --> 00:27:43,997
Coughlan launches
a dozen drone flights a day.

682
00:27:43,999 --> 00:27:45,732
I should be able
to hack into one from here.

683
00:27:45,734 --> 00:27:47,534
Okay, if you adjust
its frequencies,

684
00:27:47,536 --> 00:27:49,636
you can scan the plane's
gamma ray signature,

685
00:27:49,638 --> 00:27:51,805
and you can locate it
like we did this morning.

686
00:27:51,807 --> 00:27:53,573
Got one!
Hacking in now.

I'm putting us into a nosedive.

691
00:28:09,925 --> 00:28:12,792
Plane's rotation will cause a
g-force acceleration giving us

692
00:28:12,794 --> 00:28:16,162
roughly 20 seconds of
weightlessness-- you hold on!

can you use the drone

00:33:05,153 --> 00:33:07,553
There should be a handle
next to the throttle.

792
00:33:07,555 --> 00:33:10,323
Pull it back 15%
and move it slowly to 40.

793
00:33:10,325 --> 00:33:11,691
When you hit the ground

794
00:33:11,693 --> 00:33:13,326
kick the throttle into idle.

795
00:33:13,328 --> 00:33:14,894
Holding steady.

796
00:33:19,501 --> 00:33:21,534
Uh, we're coming in too sharp.

797
00:33:21,536 --> 00:33:23,002
We're coming in
too sharp!

798
00:33:23,004 --> 00:33:24,937
Walt, pull back.

799
00:33:24,939 --> 00:33:26,973
Pull up, pull up, pull up!

800
00:33:26,975 --> 00:33:29,676
Brace for impact!

00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,459

804
00:33:46,461 --> 00:33:49,762
I just want to sit here.

805
00:33:49,764 --> 00:33:51,964
I just want one minute of quiet.

806
00:33:51,966 --> 00:33:56,035
Get your hands up!
Hands up!

807
00:33:56,037 --> 00:33:58,571
It was nice while it lasted.

808
00:33:58,573 --> 00:34:00,873
You okay?

809
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:02,575
We're fine, why?

810
00:34:02,577 --> 00:34:05,211
I saw you guys on that roof,
when the shadow crossed you.

811
00:34:05,213 --> 00:34:06,779
You were thinking alien.

812
00:34:06,781 --> 00:34:09,882
And the unknown
scared the hell out of you.

813
00:34:09,884 --> 00:34:11,050
Did not.

814
00:34:11,052 --> 00:34:12,352
Nice try.

817
00:34:17,592 --> 00:34:19,692

00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:32,705
Yeah,

...love an audience
with Dr. Zahn.

825
00:34:41,316 --> 00:34:43,116
He designed
this device.

826
00:34:43,118 --> 00:34:44,884
I'm working on a project and
I really think that I could...

827
00:34:44,886 --> 00:34:46,686
open up...

828
00:34:46,688 --> 00:34:48,821
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

829
00:34:48,823 --> 00:34:49,856
What the hell?

830
00:34:49,858 --> 00:34:51,357
You nosed around a bit too deep

831
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,759
in the mission of this plane.

832
00:34:52,761 --> 00:34:55,261
I'm afraid you know
a little too much.

833
00:34:58,366 --> 00:35:01,267
I gotta say,
I didn't see this coming.

834
00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:03,002
This one's on me.

835
00:35:12,312 --> 00:35:15,179
Obviously, I'd prefer
not to kill you.

836
00:35:15,594 --> 00:35:18,176
But unfortunately, Mr. O'Brien
knows information

837
00:35:18,178 --> 00:35:20,979
I really can't
have getting out.

838
00:35:21,883 --> 00:35:24,417
NSA spying might've been
shut down, but yours

839
00:35:24,419 --> 00:35:25,719
is expanding.
<font color="#ff8000">TOBY:</font> The rest of us

840
00:35:25,721 --> 00:35:27,120
don't know anything
about this plane.

841
00:35:27,122 --> 00:35:29,256
In fact, I was hardly
even on this plane.

842
00:35:29,258 --> 00:35:30,323
Plane? What-what plane?

843
00:35:30,325 --> 00:35:31,324
Toby!

844
00:35:31,326 --> 00:35:32,425
Let's go for a ride.

845
00:35:32,427 --> 00:35:33,593
No, no.

846
00:35:33,595 --> 00:35:35,762
Before we head out
to what is unquestionably

847
00:35:35,764 --> 00:35:37,664
a large hole in the desert,

848
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:40,867
6,000 feet above
our heads is a drone,

849
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:42,235
operated by our friend

850
00:35:42,237 --> 00:35:43,903
Sylvester. Oh...

851
00:35:43,905 --> 00:35:46,473
He's filming and recording
this conversation.

852
00:35:46,475 --> 00:35:49,442
And if you kill us...

853
00:35:49,444 --> 00:35:50,910
you go away for murder.

854
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,812
That's good.

855
00:35:56,318 --> 00:35:59,085
Oh, I'm guessing by now
he's downloaded this footage

856
00:35:59,087 --> 00:36:01,821
to dozens of servers
around the country.

857
00:36:02,991 --> 00:36:04,257
You're bluffing.

858
00:36:04,259 --> 00:36:07,027
Walter, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

859
00:36:07,029 --> 00:36:09,262
I'd say he's gonna prove you
wrong by getting that drone

860
00:36:09,264 --> 00:36:11,531
to give you a buzz cut
in eight seconds. Seven,

861
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:12,699
six,

862
00:36:12,701 --> 00:36:14,634
five, four,

00:36:14,636 --> 00:36:16,703

and long-distance microphone.

871
00:36:49,104 --> 00:36:52,072
Walter, I hope Mr. CIA is being
nice, because the drone's camera

872
00:36:52,074 --> 00:36:55,442
stopped functioning and I can't
hear a word you're saying.

874
00:36:59,915 --> 00:37:01,481

We're missing out on the
opportunity of a lifetime here.

878
00:37:10,592 --> 00:37:13,927
Okay, in April of '71,
there was a video--

879
00:37:13,929 --> 00:37:14,961
an elliptical-shaped object

880
00:37:14,963 --> 00:37:16,329
that was spotted
over Phoenix,

881
00:37:16,331 --> 00:37:18,298
then suddenly
disappeared midair.

882
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,632
What was it?

883
00:37:19,634 --> 00:37:21,267
We still don't know.

884
00:37:21,269 --> 00:37:22,402
Where's Hoffa?

885
00:37:22,404 --> 00:37:23,903
The Meadowlands.
Everyone knows that.

886
00:37:23,905 --> 00:37:24,971
JFK?

887
00:37:24,973 --> 00:37:27,307
Don't push it.

888
00:37:27,309 --> 00:37:29,442
All right, let's head out, gang.

889
00:37:31,113 --> 00:37:32,779

892
00:37:51,633 --> 00:37:53,166
I'm pretty sure
my concept

893
00:37:53,168 --> 00:37:55,468
will move from
theory to reality

894
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:57,303
very quickly.

895
00:37:59,074 --> 00:38:00,974
I learned something today,
about the team.

896
00:38:00,976 --> 00:38:02,208
You know the idea

897
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:05,078
that nature always fills
an empty space?

898
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,547
“Nature abhors a vacuum.”
Aristotle.

899
00:38:07,549 --> 00:38:09,315
Yeah, well, it really

900
00:38:09,317 --> 00:38:10,884
applies to the genius mind.

901
00:38:10,886 --> 00:38:13,820
You all have a real fear
of the unknown.

902
00:38:13,822 --> 00:38:15,522
You really struggle
with anything

903
00:38:15,524 --> 00:38:18,024
you can't prove
or explain.

904
00:38:18,026 --> 00:38:21,327
There's nothing that
we really can't explain.

905
00:38:21,329 --> 00:38:24,464
What about death?

906
00:38:27,436 --> 00:38:29,502
It is the breakdown
of the biological functions

907
00:38:29,504 --> 00:38:30,837
that support life.

908
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:32,605
See, you-you throw science

909
00:38:32,607 --> 00:38:34,674
at things that
should be emotional.

910
00:38:34,676 --> 00:38:38,111
We process the world
differently from most people.

911
00:38:38,113 --> 00:38:39,379
That's all it is.

912
00:38:39,381 --> 00:38:40,914
You know, and truthfully,

913
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:43,550
I know exactly what's
going on with Megan.

914
00:38:43,552 --> 00:38:45,952
There is a process to life

915
00:38:45,954 --> 00:38:47,854
that ends in an unknown.

916
00:38:50,258 --> 00:38:52,258
Toby.

917
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,260
What?

918
00:38:54,262 --> 00:38:56,863
Can you explain
Megan's condition as it stands?

919
00:38:56,865 --> 00:38:59,599
She has a bacterial infection
in her lungs. A pneumonia.

920
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:01,000
Why is that?

921
00:39:01,002 --> 00:39:02,402
She has scarred, damaged lungs.

922
00:39:02,404 --> 00:39:03,770
Why?

923
00:39:03,772 --> 00:39:06,573
She's inhaled small amounts
of food and saliva

924
00:39:06,575 --> 00:39:08,167
that, over time,
have damaged her lungs.

925
00:39:08,169 --> 00:39:08,774
Mm-hmm.

926
00:39:08,777 --> 00:39:09,943
Why is that happening?

927
00:39:09,945 --> 00:39:12,612
Uh, she can't swallow very well

928
00:39:12,614 --> 00:39:14,147
because of the MS.

929
00:39:14,149 --> 00:39:15,915
Uh, explain.

930
00:39:15,917 --> 00:39:17,617
The MS damaged some nerves

931
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:19,385
in her brain,
probably her medulla.

932
00:39:19,387 --> 00:39:21,221
How come?
Her own immune system

933
00:39:21,223 --> 00:39:24,057
attacked the myelin sheaths
around the nerves.

934
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:25,358
Thank you, Toby.

938
00:39:34,069 --> 00:39:38,004
why is her own body
attacking her nerves?

939
00:39:39,641 --> 00:39:42,542

the first time that we met,
that we save everybody?

945
00:40:04,266 --> 00:40:06,933
I am going to save

946
00:40:06,935 --> 00:40:09,102
my sister.

947
00:40:23,318 --> 00:40:26,085
I just spoke to the doctor.
Why is she not on a respirator?

948
00:40:26,087 --> 00:40:27,420
He says it's her best chance.

949
00:40:27,422 --> 00:40:28,855
She didn't want to go on it.

950
00:40:28,857 --> 00:40:30,156
Well, it's your job
to convince her.

951
00:40:30,158 --> 00:40:31,791
She's sick;
she's not thinking clearly.

952
00:40:31,793 --> 00:40:32,992
She was thinking.

953
00:40:32,994 --> 00:40:34,527
I trusted you.

954
00:40:34,529 --> 00:40:36,963
You promised me you would
do the right thing.

955
00:40:36,965 --> 00:40:39,666
I did do the right thing.
For Megan.

956
00:40:39,668 --> 00:40:41,167
She doesn't want
to prolong her state,

957
00:40:41,169 --> 00:40:42,802
so I respected her wishes.

958
00:40:42,804 --> 00:40:45,371
Don't go head to head
with me on this.

959
00:40:45,373 --> 00:40:47,807
You've known her for a year,

960
00:40:47,809 --> 00:40:50,176
I've known her my whole life.

961
00:40:50,178 --> 00:40:52,445
I love her just as much.

962
00:40:52,447 --> 00:40:55,248
And I am sorry, Walter,
but you are wrong.

963
00:41:04,492 --> 00:41:06,292
Fine.

964
00:41:06,294 --> 00:41:09,829
Fine, I'll just have to
take care of it myself.

965
00:41:09,831 --> 00:41:11,998
This isn't over.
