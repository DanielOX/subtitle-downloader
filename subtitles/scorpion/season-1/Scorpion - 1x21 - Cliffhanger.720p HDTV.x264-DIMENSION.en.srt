1
00:00:04,837 --> 00:00:06,471
<i>My name is Walter O'Brien.</i>

2
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:10,875
<i>I have the fourth highest IQ</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

3
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:12,610
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

4
00:00:13,105 --> 00:00:15,706
<i>When I was 11, the FBI</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking NASA</i>

5
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,408
<i>to get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,611
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

7
00:00:20,613 --> 00:00:22,045
<i>tackling worldwide threats</i>

8
00:00:22,047 --> 00:00:23,614
<i>only we can solve.</i>

9
00:00:23,616 --> 00:00:25,315
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

10
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,084
<i>Sylvester's a human calculator.</i>

11
00:00:27,086 --> 00:00:29,519
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

12
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:31,722
<i>Agent Cabe Gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

13
00:00:31,724 --> 00:00:33,924
<i>And Paige?</i>
<i>Well, Paige isn't like us.</i>

14
00:00:33,926 --> 00:00:36,293
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

15
00:00:36,295 --> 00:00:38,996
<i>while we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

16
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:41,131
<i>Together, we are Scorpion.</i>

17
00:00:44,636 --> 00:00:45,836
Wedding's coming up soon.

18
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,471
We need to give people
time to shop.

19
00:00:47,473 --> 00:00:48,739
I hear what you're saying,

20
00:00:48,741 --> 00:00:51,408
but I really don't
ever see us using china.

21
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,310
Your parents have
beautiful wedding china.

22
00:00:53,312 --> 00:00:55,045
That they never use.

23
00:00:55,047 --> 00:00:57,547
Well, we need to
register for <i>something.</i>

24
00:00:57,549 --> 00:01:00,917
Okay. Well, there's this
really cool NFL chess set.

25
00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:03,053
QB's the king,
cheerleader's the queen.

26
00:01:03,055 --> 00:01:05,289
Never... ever...

27
00:01:06,057 --> 00:01:07,624
...ever.

28
00:01:07,626 --> 00:01:08,792
China it is.

29
00:01:08,794 --> 00:01:09,726
That's my boy.

30
00:01:09,728 --> 00:01:12,129
Ready to roll?

31
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:14,064
Yeah.

32
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:16,800
Okay.

33
00:01:16,802 --> 00:01:19,670
System up and running.

34
00:01:19,672 --> 00:01:21,004
Diagnostic
clear.

35
00:01:21,006 --> 00:01:22,172
Good to go, Sarah.

36
00:01:30,648 --> 00:01:32,783
Hooking up O2.

37
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,121
Go for oxygen. Okay.

38
00:01:38,123 --> 00:01:39,656
12 hours

39
00:01:39,658 --> 00:01:42,559
since reactive agent was added
to the phosphate compound.

40
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,361
Reading off weights.

41
00:01:44,363 --> 00:01:46,763
Dish one: 2.2 ounces.

42
00:01:46,765 --> 00:01:49,032
Dish two:

43
00:01:49,034 --> 00:01:51,234
2.2 ounces.

44
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,269
Dish number three...

45
00:01:52,271 --> 00:01:54,137
Babe,
your O2's dropping.

46
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:55,405
Correct manually?

47
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:56,840
Yeah.

48
00:01:58,643 --> 00:01:59,743
How's that?

49
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,178
No increase.

50
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,879
You know what, Sarah?
I'm getting...

51
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:04,915
dizzy.
Okay. Step out.

52
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,453
Babe, the door

53
00:02:09,455 --> 00:02:10,455
won't open.

54
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,657
Door won't respond.

55
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:14,925
I'm having trouble
breathing.

56
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:16,026
Sarah...

57
00:02:16,028 --> 00:02:17,794
Jim,

58
00:02:17,796 --> 00:02:20,116
sarin gas is leaking in from
Tox Storage through the vents.

59
00:02:20,965 --> 00:02:22,299
No, no, no.

60
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:23,800
Do not remove cover!

61
00:02:23,802 --> 00:02:25,335
Your lab's filled
with nerve gas!

62
00:02:25,337 --> 00:02:26,337
Hold on!

63
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,173
This is Sarah Jacobs in Zone 1.
We have a breach

64
00:02:30,175 --> 00:02:31,808
in the lab, and Jim is in there.

65
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,443
Somebody help us!

66
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:39,616
Come on, Ferret Bueller,
stand up.

67
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,752
Good boy.

68
00:02:41,754 --> 00:02:43,514
Look at that--
he thinks he's people.

69
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,722
When are we ditching

70
00:02:44,723 --> 00:02:46,156
this weasel?
You don't like pets?

71
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:47,624
I wasn't talking
about the ferret.

72
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,092
How long are you
gonna punish me

73
00:02:49,094 --> 00:02:50,294
for sleeping through our date?

74
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,895
What's your lifespan?

75
00:02:56,868 --> 00:02:59,302
Elia's popping in?
Good!

76
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,838
You're here! Hope
you don't mind me

77
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,006
stopping by unannounced.

78
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:04,508
Wanted to give you this.

79
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,244
You saved my daughter--
I can get you a little something.

80
00:03:07,246 --> 00:03:10,447
Come on, open it up.
Okay.

81
00:03:12,316 --> 00:03:15,819
Wow. A DC magnetic coil
for my rocket,

82
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,988
circa 1987.
A bit rusty.

83
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,956
28 bucks, retail.

84
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,025
But it comes with something else.
Tetanus?

85
00:03:22,693 --> 00:03:24,294
This.

86
00:03:24,296 --> 00:03:25,462
Excuse me?

87
00:03:25,464 --> 00:03:27,264
I was eating breakfast,
and it hit me.

88
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:28,698
The work you're doing
on your rocket

89
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,001
isn't that much different
than the engine in the Ferrari.

90
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:33,670
Air and fuel intake results
in a propulsion of the piston heads...

91
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,673
That is, in theory, what I'm doing with
my propulsion chamber.

92
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,820
How cute-- they're finishing
each other's sentences.

93
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:39,886
Thought you should
drive it around for

94
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,146
a little bit, get a feel
for what you're building

95
00:03:42,147 --> 00:03:44,614
on a smaller scale--
but not that much smaller.

96
00:03:44,616 --> 00:03:45,882
You're giving him
a half-million-dollar car

97
00:03:45,884 --> 00:03:47,417
to help him with
his science project?

98
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:48,952
It's just a loaner.

99
00:03:48,954 --> 00:03:51,188
Though... truth is,
well, I got nine

100
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,291
of these things
and I never drive them, so...

101
00:03:54,293 --> 00:03:55,952
you might want to hold on
to it for a while.

102
00:03:55,953 --> 00:03:58,229
Walter, he's trying to poach you.

103
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,397
This is just a "thank you."
Lying billionaire says what?

104
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:02,165
Huh?
Close enough.

105
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:03,633
Guys, don't ruin this for me.

106
00:04:03,635 --> 00:04:04,835
I already offered
Walt a job,

107
00:04:04,837 --> 00:04:06,303
and he turned me down--
he's happy here.

108
00:04:08,106 --> 00:04:09,539
My driver has arrived.

109
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,674
Walter,

110
00:04:10,676 --> 00:04:11,975
enjoy the car.

111
00:04:11,977 --> 00:04:13,310
We'll talk soon.
Guys, say hello

112
00:04:13,312 --> 00:04:15,345
to the rest of the gang for me.
Hey,

113
00:04:15,347 --> 00:04:16,746
give my best
to the Illuminati.

114
00:04:16,748 --> 00:04:18,949
Thank you. Thank...
This car has

115
00:04:18,951 --> 00:04:20,350
strings attached.

116
00:04:20,352 --> 00:04:22,552
And those strings will
fly off once I'm driving

117
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,254
at 190...

118
00:04:24,256 --> 00:04:25,522
miles an hour.
What's that?

119
00:04:25,524 --> 00:04:27,357
Trouble.
Ralph.

120
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:29,559
Come check out this engineering.

121
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:30,827
Why is your kid
in the monkey suit?

122
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:32,929
Picture day. He's so cute--
he wanted to pick

123
00:04:32,931 --> 00:04:35,165
the outfit himself.
There, look at that.

124
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:36,399
You don't see
what's going on there?

125
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,401
Mm, no.
Hey, Ralphy-boy,

126
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,303
could you do Uncle Toby a favor
and take off that jacket?

127
00:04:40,305 --> 00:04:42,839
You don't want to get
grease on it.

128
00:04:42,841 --> 00:04:45,442
You better roll up those
sleeves, too, buddy, just to be safe.

129
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:52,749
Congratulations,
you're raising Walter.

130
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,017
Oh, God.

131
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:56,720
Ralph! Ralph,
my action figure is here!

132
00:04:56,722 --> 00:04:59,656
Be thankful--
Ralph could be emulating <i>him.</i>

133
00:04:59,658 --> 00:05:01,258
It came in
this morning.

134
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,526
It's very rare.

135
00:05:02,528 --> 00:05:04,294
A silicone rubber,
composite prototype

136
00:05:04,296 --> 00:05:06,796
of the original
Super Fun Guy action figure

137
00:05:06,798 --> 00:05:08,331
from the 1970s.

138
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,000
Tomorrow morning,
I'll be receiving

139
00:05:10,002 --> 00:05:12,035
the rest of the gang:
the Giggler,

140
00:05:12,037 --> 00:05:13,870
Sir Jokes-A-Lot,
Zany Zoey,

141
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:15,272
the entire team!

142
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:16,673
Just like us.

143
00:05:16,675 --> 00:05:19,943
Cool, but...
I'm not really part of Scorpion.

144
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,345
Hey, hey, of course you are.
You helped us crack

145
00:05:22,347 --> 00:05:23,847
that video game that
caught those bad guys.

146
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:25,682
You-you hacked that
Japanese warship.

147
00:05:25,684 --> 00:05:28,652
You're a very, very
important part of the team.

148
00:05:28,654 --> 00:05:30,554
And, Ralph, that's why
this one is for you.

149
00:05:30,556 --> 00:05:31,922
He can't have that.

150
00:05:31,924 --> 00:05:33,089
It's okay, I have, like, four.

151
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:36,059
Thank you.
Okay, off to school. I'll take that.

152
00:05:36,061 --> 00:05:37,193
Ralph.

153
00:05:37,195 --> 00:05:38,628
Race cars?

154
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,796
Collectible toys?

155
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,631
You guys spoil him.

156
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,134
Can I drive the car?
Nope.

157
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:46,369
♪ ♪

158
00:05:46,371 --> 00:05:48,772
The neurotoxin research
facility right outside of L.A.

159
00:05:48,774 --> 00:05:51,441
Something tells me I'm not
gonna like what's in this file.

160
00:05:51,443 --> 00:05:53,343
Someone took over the
building this morning.

161
00:05:53,345 --> 00:05:54,545
It's computerized to the hilt.

162
00:05:54,546 --> 00:05:57,180
Whoever hacked in
has total control.

163
00:05:57,182 --> 00:05:58,348
Bulletproof security doors,

164
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,183
labs where the nerve agents
are stored,

165
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:02,285
and a ventilation system
that could spread gas

166
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:04,387
throughout the facility,
killing everyone who's trapped inside.

167
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:05,755
How many?

168
00:06:05,757 --> 00:06:07,324
23 very scared scientists.

169
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:09,826
One of whom-- Jim Stone--
has been locked in a room

170
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,628
that the hacker
filled with sarin.

171
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,397
And he's keeping Stone's O2
levels in his Hazmat suit

172
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,966
so low, he's
barely breathing.

173
00:06:15,968 --> 00:06:17,801
So, if Stone keeps
the suit on much longer,

174
00:06:17,803 --> 00:06:20,604
he runs out of air, and if
he takes it off, he's dead.

175
00:06:20,606 --> 00:06:21,771
It gets better.

176
00:06:21,773 --> 00:06:24,507
Our little Baghdad
bombings from '97

177
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,309
have come back
to bite us in the ass.

178
00:06:26,311 --> 00:06:27,353
How?

179
00:06:27,377 --> 00:06:29,888
Hacker wants the president
to disclose on live TV

180
00:06:30,048 --> 00:06:32,182
everything about the bombings
we never released.

181
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,150
How we missed
our intended target

182
00:06:34,152 --> 00:06:36,720
and killed 2,000 civilians,
how we covered it up.

183
00:06:36,722 --> 00:06:39,456
Commander in Chief
cannot concede to threats.

184
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:42,292
We have any leads on this guy?
Homeland hasn't been able to trace

185
00:06:42,294 --> 00:06:44,527
the e-mail communiqué
that's been coming in to HQ.

186
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,029
Bouncing off servers
all over the world.

187
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,598
All we know is that it came in
from a cell phone.

188
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,498
Time frame?

189
00:06:49,522 --> 00:06:51,868
Perp wanted POTUS on the air
within 90 minutes

190
00:06:51,937 --> 00:06:54,104
or we'd be sorry--
that was 40 minutes ago.

191
00:06:54,106 --> 00:06:55,972
So get your team
to the site ASAP.

192
00:06:55,974 --> 00:06:57,907
The media already has wind
that something's up.

193
00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:00,043
Before you know it,
it'll be a circus.

194
00:07:03,914 --> 00:07:07,083
After the '95 Tokyo subway
sarin gas attacks,

195
00:07:07,085 --> 00:07:10,387
the United States created
an anti-neurotoxin program

196
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,256
that resulted in the lab
that is now under siege.

197
00:07:13,258 --> 00:07:15,992
We are more than an hour
into this takeover.

198
00:07:15,994 --> 00:07:19,529
Now, experts claim if any
of this neurotoxic material

199
00:07:19,531 --> 00:07:21,798
were to aerosol
out of the facility,

200
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,934
it could possibly kill
thousands of Angelenos.

201
00:07:26,003 --> 00:07:27,637
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

202
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,339
- Credentials?
- It's all right.

203
00:07:29,341 --> 00:07:30,774
She's with me.

204
00:07:30,776 --> 00:07:32,776
The five zones of the building
run east to west.

205
00:07:32,778 --> 00:07:35,011
Some larger, with free access
to multiple rooms.

206
00:07:35,013 --> 00:07:37,580
Other zones are mostly laboratories.
There's a vent system

207
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,049
linked to a server, so air flow,

208
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:41,384
including the release
of nerve gas into the vents,

209
00:07:41,386 --> 00:07:42,719
could be manipulated.

210
00:07:43,788 --> 00:07:46,690
We got Hazmat on
standby, and they're ready.

211
00:07:46,692 --> 00:07:48,024
My God,
what a nightmare.

212
00:07:48,026 --> 00:07:49,626
As this poor guy, Jim,

213
00:07:49,628 --> 00:07:52,128
already learned, his O2 levels
are at the bottom rung.

214
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,697
We need to figure out
a way in ASAP.

215
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,799
I can rig a charge to blow
through that door in five minutes.

216
00:07:55,801 --> 00:07:58,068
No go. All doors
are computer-controlled.

217
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,003
We breach 'em, the hacker
sees this on the system,

218
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:02,038
and instantly
releases the gas.

219
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,840
It's not just the door
that won't let us in--

220
00:08:03,842 --> 00:08:05,942
whoever hacked this lab
set up some sort of block

221
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,610
that I've never seen before.
I can't even get

222
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,845
within a mile
of the network.

223
00:08:08,847 --> 00:08:10,547
The hacker's
90-minute deadline

224
00:08:10,549 --> 00:08:12,816
is practically up,
and, uh, we will not be able

225
00:08:12,818 --> 00:08:14,017
to regain control in time.

226
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:15,652
You think or you know?
I know.

227
00:08:15,654 --> 00:08:17,887
We're in the dark right now
as to how he got in

228
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:19,556
and what he's doing
to keep us out.

229
00:08:19,558 --> 00:08:21,458
I'm also, um...

230
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,826
I'm concerned from
an efficiency standpoint

231
00:08:22,828 --> 00:08:25,261
that my personal connection
to the case

232
00:08:25,263 --> 00:08:29,199
might affect my ability
to solve it, so...

233
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:30,934
What's happening right now,
it's not your fault.

234
00:08:30,936 --> 00:08:32,736
I designed the software
used for the bombs.

235
00:08:32,738 --> 00:08:34,003
The bombs killed the civilians.

236
00:08:34,005 --> 00:08:35,839
The hacker wants revenge
for those deaths.

237
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:37,774
I'm in the DNA
of this thing, Cabe.

238
00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:40,243
No, you're not.
You were just a kid.

239
00:08:40,245 --> 00:08:41,611
The blame lies with me.

240
00:08:41,613 --> 00:08:44,280
Now, right now
we got a job to do, okay?

241
00:08:44,282 --> 00:08:45,548
HQ's getting another e-mail.

242
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,883
"I told you what I wanted.

243
00:08:46,885 --> 00:08:48,885
You've give me nothing.
Time's up."

244
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:51,354
Three sentences-- issue,
application, conclusion.

245
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:52,489
He's using the language
of someone who's

246
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,624
about to take action.
Something's wrong, guys.

247
00:08:54,626 --> 00:08:58,228
Oh, God, Jim,
just hold on, okay? Hold on!

248
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,662
I'm gonna try to override
the system.

249
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,264
The hacker's
cut off his oxygen.

250
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:03,299
She can't override
the system. We're helpless.

251
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:05,502
Come on!

252
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:06,669
Sarah...

253
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,971
He can't breathe.

254
00:09:07,973 --> 00:09:09,472
Turn it off.

255
00:09:09,474 --> 00:09:11,708
Cabe! Turn it off!

256
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,576
Jim, no, hang on, okay?

257
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,714
It's not working! Damn it!

258
00:09:17,716 --> 00:09:19,516
I have to open my mask.
I can't breathe.

259
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:20,884
No! Oh, God,
Jim, hold on!

260
00:09:20,886 --> 00:09:22,886
Do not remove your helmet!
Just hold on!

261
00:09:22,888 --> 00:09:25,421
He takes that off,
he's dead in seconds.

262
00:09:25,423 --> 00:09:27,223
Don't take off your helmet,
okay? Hold on...

263
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:37,801
Jim!

264
00:09:39,703 --> 00:09:42,305
Jim!

265
00:09:46,154 --> 00:09:50,154

267
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,719
Tensions are high as
the unfolding hostage situation

268
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,253
has now become a murder scene.

269
00:10:03,255 --> 00:10:04,955
With the victim's body
unrecovered

270
00:10:04,957 --> 00:10:06,857
and dozens still trapped inside,

271
00:10:06,859 --> 00:10:08,592
the question
everyone's asking is:

272
00:10:08,594 --> 00:10:10,861
What are the authorities
going to do?

273
00:10:10,863 --> 00:10:12,696
Hacker's now saying that
everyone dies in 60 minutes

274
00:10:12,698 --> 00:10:14,331
if we don't give in
to his demands.

275
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,666
We got to get in there <i>now!</i>
Yelling doesn't help.

276
00:10:16,668 --> 00:10:18,935
I don't even have
a digital foot in the door.

277
00:10:18,937 --> 00:10:21,171
He basically made
the entire system invisible,

278
00:10:21,173 --> 00:10:22,806
and I don't know how.

279
00:10:22,808 --> 00:10:23,638
Structural?

280
00:10:23,662 --> 00:10:24,876
Well, the third time I've been
through the blueprints--

281
00:10:24,877 --> 00:10:26,676
no weaknesses.
Unless we can un-hack

282
00:10:26,678 --> 00:10:28,078
those security doors,

283
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,013
we're not getting in.
She's breaking down.

284
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,928
At a base level, we're feeling

285
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,764
the same frustration as her--
outside looking in.

286
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,599
Helplessness is
a destructive emotion.

287
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,167
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop, stop.

288
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,902
Outside looking in.

289
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:40,404
We need to do that.

290
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,839
We need to look
into the building-- right no

291
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:45,108
we're out here trying to jump

292
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,977
on an external network signal--
but we can't.

293
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,912
Maybe that's because
the problem is internal.

294
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:51,448
Like an actual physical compromise
to the building's internal server.

295
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,983
The hacker's been manipulating

296
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,851
a system
he did not design.

297
00:10:54,853 --> 00:10:56,386
He could've overloaded
certain portions of it,

298
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:59,022
like burnt circuits, wiring,
and if that's so,

299
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:02,626
that's why we can't get
into the system from out here.

300
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,661
Fried hardware. We fix it,

301
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:06,229
we can get control of the system

302
00:11:06,231 --> 00:11:08,144
and then we can retake control
of the building.

303
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,501
Exactly. Now, we need to search the
blueprints for the server hub.

304
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:12,436
Gallo.

305
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,770
Just got off

306
00:11:13,772 --> 00:11:15,238
the horn with the White House.

307
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,741
Bodies dropping is bad press,
but POTUS still can't be

308
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,076
puppet-mastered by some thug.

309
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,777
So they found a middle ground.

310
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:21,845
An appeasement?

311
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:22,879
We're gonna release all Intel

312
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:24,281
related to the Baghdad bombing

313
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,716
in a massive document dump,

314
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:28,552
everything from combat
weather reports

315
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,120
to supply requisitions.

316
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:31,822
So it looks as if
it's a run-of-the-mill

317
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,557
declassification of records.

318
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,192
Based on what the hacker's
looking for,

319
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,594
is it necessary
to release all documents

320
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:38,929
from the Baghdad
operation,

321
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:42,065
particularly certain memorandum
between you and I

322
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:44,067
a few days prior to the bombing?

323
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:46,369
We're mid-standoff,

324
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:48,171
and you want me
to cherry-pick out data

325
00:11:48,173 --> 00:11:49,539
so you don't hurt
your relationship

326
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,974
with your little pal?

327
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:54,578
O'Brien is instrumental to
Scorpion and national security.

328
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,447
Anything
that might disrupt that...

329
00:11:57,449 --> 00:11:59,015
I am Homeland Director.

330
00:11:59,017 --> 00:12:02,085
So I will worry about what
disrupts national security.

331
00:12:10,828 --> 00:12:12,529
Hey.

332
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:17,100
Have O'Brien meet me around
back. It's important.

333
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:19,936
What, more demands
from the hacker?

334
00:12:21,806 --> 00:12:25,709
There are things about Baghdad
that you don't know.

335
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:28,011
What things?

336
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:31,314
Son, I was honest with you
when I told you

337
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:33,316
that I had no idea
the government planned

338
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:35,585
to use your technology
for munitions

339
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:38,421
instead of aid packages.

340
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:40,290
You were just a kid.
I would never have lied to you.

341
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,225
I already know this.

342
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,163
Son, you know
how I feel about you.

343
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:49,299
Cabe, what are you trying
to tell me?

344
00:12:51,969 --> 00:12:56,339
Three days
before the bombs were dropped,

345
00:12:56,341 --> 00:12:59,743
Merrick told me
of the true agenda.

346
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:03,713
You knew

347
00:13:03,715 --> 00:13:05,782
they were gonna drop bombs?

348
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:08,084
Not at first.
Just three days prior.

349
00:13:08,086 --> 00:13:10,086
And you never told me.

350
00:13:10,088 --> 00:13:11,655
I was concerned that if I did,

351
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:14,958
you would disable your software
and sabotage the mission.

352
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,093
That's exactly what I would have done.
And you would've gone

353
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:19,696
to prison for doing so, and I
would've been tried for treason.

354
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:25,135
Son, I had no idea that
civilians would've been killed.

355
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,904
The target was an Iraqi leader.

356
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:33,043
Come on, Walter. Say something.

357
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,946
If you're done,
I have work to do.

358
00:13:40,484 --> 00:13:43,086
Right there. Cam 23,
bottom left. We got it.

359
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,989
Walt, where have you been? We
found the server hub in Zone 1.

360
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,158
Walter.

361
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,160
Are you okay?

362
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,230
Walter, you hear me?

363
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:56,199
What the hell is going on here?

364
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:59,336
Nothing. Uh, let me see...
let me see this.

365
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:03,707
Okay.

366
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,141
Okay, excuse me.

367
00:14:05,143 --> 00:14:06,910
- Just a minute.
- Whoa.

368
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:07,691
What are you doing?

369
00:14:07,692 --> 00:14:09,303
I'm calling Sarah.
She's the only scientist

370
00:14:09,304 --> 00:14:11,070
in Zone 1. If we're gonna save
these people,

371
00:14:11,072 --> 00:14:12,438
then we'll need her help.
Walter.

372
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,540
What are you doing?
She just lost her fiancé,

373
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:15,942
and you've got something
going on.

374
00:14:15,944 --> 00:14:17,477
You want her to
be able to help,

375
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:19,312
then she'll need to talk
to someone human.

376
00:14:20,982 --> 00:14:23,549
Hello?
Sarah,

377
00:14:23,551 --> 00:14:25,018
I'm-I'm Paige Dineen.
I'm with the team trying

378
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,452
to help you out of the building.

379
00:14:26,454 --> 00:14:28,388
I-I can't imagine
what you've been dealing with

380
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,223
or-or what you're going
through right now,

381
00:14:30,225 --> 00:14:31,691
but if you and your coworkers

382
00:14:31,693 --> 00:14:34,193
are going to get out of there,
we're gonna need your help.

383
00:14:34,195 --> 00:14:37,163
We-we...
we were getting married.

384
00:14:37,165 --> 00:14:38,285
We need to hurry. We need...

385
00:14:38,832 --> 00:14:40,533
I know Jim
loved you,

386
00:14:40,535 --> 00:14:43,603
and he'd want you to be safe and
to get out of there and-and live

387
00:14:43,605 --> 00:14:45,571
the rest of your life.
But to do that,

388
00:14:45,573 --> 00:14:49,309
you'll need to get
to the server hub down by

389
00:14:49,311 --> 00:14:51,544
the far west entrance.

390
00:14:51,546 --> 00:14:52,712
And bring your cell phone.

391
00:14:52,714 --> 00:14:53,980
We'll need to see each other.

392
00:14:55,816 --> 00:14:57,850
<i>Do you know what the word</i>

393
00:14:57,852 --> 00:14:59,252
"appropriateness"
means, Ralph?

394
00:14:59,254 --> 00:15:01,988
Suitable for a particular
purpose, person, or occasion.

395
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,390
In school,
do you think it's appropriate

396
00:15:04,392 --> 00:15:07,894
to explain in detail the effects
nerve gas has on the human body?

397
00:15:07,896 --> 00:15:10,730
We were doing science.
It wasn't

398
00:15:10,732 --> 00:15:12,899
appropriate, Ralph. I know

399
00:15:12,901 --> 00:15:14,567
everyone's in a tizzy
over what's going on

400
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:15,835
in the news,
but we have

401
00:15:15,837 --> 00:15:16,936
to keep it appropriate.

402
00:15:16,938 --> 00:15:19,706
Excuse me,
Principal Pastorneck.

403
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,040
You're needed in
Mr. Berger's class.

404
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,844
You stay here.

405
00:15:35,422 --> 00:15:38,558
In addition to SWAT,
Homeland Security, and the FBI,

406
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,327
independent government
contractor, Team Scorpion,

407
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:42,662
is on the case.

408
00:15:42,664 --> 00:15:46,733
Considering the stakes,
they'll need all hands on deck.

409
00:16:12,526 --> 00:16:14,193
Okay, I'm here.

410
00:16:14,195 --> 00:16:16,262
I'm putting you on speaker
so you can hear

411
00:16:16,264 --> 00:16:17,630
from the rest of our team.

412
00:16:19,366 --> 00:16:20,833
Hi, Sarah.

413
00:16:20,835 --> 00:16:22,068
Um, can you open

414
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,004
the panel and point
your camera at it?

415
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:27,039
Great.

416
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,008
Nothing out
of the ordinary.

417
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,010
Oh, oh. Okay, um,
the large red cables

418
00:16:31,012 --> 00:16:32,278
to your left,
can you move them

419
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,813
to the side?
Let's see behind it.

420
00:16:33,815 --> 00:16:37,583
Yeah. There it is.

421
00:16:37,585 --> 00:16:38,885
- Oh, boy.
- What?

422
00:16:38,887 --> 00:16:41,587
I was right. It is
an internal structural problem,

423
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:43,356
but the wires weren't fried--
they were cut.

424
00:16:43,358 --> 00:16:44,590
What do you mean "cut"?

425
00:16:44,592 --> 00:16:47,360
Sarah, uh, what is
your system-check protocol?

426
00:16:47,362 --> 00:16:49,529
I run a diagnostic every morning
at 8:15

427
00:16:49,531 --> 00:16:51,131
once everyone's carded
into the building.

428
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:53,433
And today everything checked out?
Yes. No one's left since.

429
00:16:53,435 --> 00:16:55,368
- Not good.
- What?

430
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,602
What's not good?
It was an inside job.

431
00:16:56,604 --> 00:16:59,272
The person who cut the
wireless server cables,

432
00:16:59,274 --> 00:17:01,474
the hacker, is inside
the building right now.

433
00:17:01,476 --> 00:17:03,109
Oh, God.
Sarah,

434
00:17:03,111 --> 00:17:05,211
I need you
to remain calm, all right?

435
00:17:05,213 --> 00:17:06,479
We need you.

436
00:17:06,481 --> 00:17:08,314
You're the only one
that we can count on.

437
00:17:08,316 --> 00:17:10,817
All right, first things first,
we need to get you back

438
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:13,085
to your control room.
All the labs have monitors,

439
00:17:13,087 --> 00:17:14,487
and if the hacker
sees you moving about,

440
00:17:14,489 --> 00:17:15,988
checking
the server hubs,

441
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,223
then that's bad news.

442
00:17:17,225 --> 00:17:19,358
How do you know he didn't see me
on my way down here?

443
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,494
He would've killed you already.

444
00:17:21,496 --> 00:17:22,428
What? It's true.

445
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,362
What is wrong with you?

446
00:17:23,364 --> 00:17:25,298
Okay, based
on hallway dimensions

447
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,067
and security camera
points of view,

448
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,635
I can calculate the blind spots

449
00:17:29,637 --> 00:17:31,737
along the way back
to the control room.

450
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:35,842
Come get me out!

451
00:17:35,844 --> 00:17:37,810
She's hysterical.
Whoever

452
00:17:37,812 --> 00:17:39,111
killed Jim

453
00:17:39,113 --> 00:17:42,482
is in the building with me.
Sarah,

454
00:17:42,484 --> 00:17:45,451
this is Agent Cabe Gallo,
Homeland Security.

455
00:17:45,453 --> 00:17:47,720
You're gonna have
to trust us.

456
00:17:47,722 --> 00:17:49,755
If you keep calling attention
to yourself,

457
00:17:49,757 --> 00:17:51,023
who's ever in there
will see you.

458
00:17:51,025 --> 00:17:52,859
Now, you know
that we can't

459
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:54,494
get through those doors.

460
00:17:54,496 --> 00:17:56,963
Trust is the only way
this is gonna work.

461
00:17:56,965 --> 00:17:59,365
So we trust you to get
the job done. You trust us

462
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:01,434
to keep you safe.
Just shut up!

463
00:18:02,536 --> 00:18:04,537
Shut up. Shut up, Cabe.

464
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:06,539
Walter.
Sylvester,

465
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,441
get Sarah safely back
to the control room.

466
00:18:08,443 --> 00:18:09,408
And, Cabe,

467
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,910
you do not get to tell anybody

468
00:18:10,912 --> 00:18:13,379
to trust you ever again.

469
00:18:13,381 --> 00:18:15,715
Okay. Take it easy.
You slip so easily

470
00:18:15,717 --> 00:18:17,950
into asking people to trust you
when you want something

471
00:18:17,952 --> 00:18:19,919
from them.
Walter,

472
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:21,554
let's talk about this.
No.

473
00:18:21,556 --> 00:18:23,556
I'm not gonna be tricked
into believing you.

474
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:25,625
Not a second time.

475
00:18:25,627 --> 00:18:27,093
So, Director,

476
00:18:27,095 --> 00:18:28,160
we'll do everything that we can

477
00:18:28,162 --> 00:18:29,896
to save these people's lives,
but...

478
00:18:29,898 --> 00:18:31,631
once this case is concluded,

479
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:34,233
I want Agent Gallo
off Scorpion.

480
00:18:34,235 --> 00:18:36,669
I do not want to work
with him ever again.

481
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,404
Uh, bro,

482
00:18:38,406 --> 00:18:40,606
let's take a breath.
No, let's not take a breath.

483
00:18:40,608 --> 00:18:43,476
I want Gallo out, or I quit.

484
00:18:43,478 --> 00:18:45,144
End of story.

485
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,274
What just happened?

486
00:19:14,276 --> 00:19:15,675
Nothing important.
It...

487
00:19:15,677 --> 00:19:18,378
seemed important.
Very important.

488
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,348
Not more than saving the lives
of the people in this facility.

489
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,916
Starting with Sarah,

490
00:19:22,918 --> 00:19:25,485
who needs you to get her
out of that control room.

491
00:19:25,487 --> 00:19:28,121
Sarah, hug the wall to your left
and go to the...

492
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:29,656
Can we just clarify
that you're saying Cabe

493
00:19:29,658 --> 00:19:31,658
is no longer on the team?
Consider it clarified.

494
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,859
Okay, so we know

495
00:19:32,861 --> 00:19:35,695
that the hacker is sending
e-mails via cell phone.

496
00:19:35,697 --> 00:19:38,498
Let's pull up surveillance
footage of a-a minute prior

497
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,100
to when we received
each e-mail.

498
00:19:40,102 --> 00:19:42,836
Look for, uh,
suspicious behavior.

499
00:19:42,838 --> 00:19:44,437
That's gonna take a minute.

500
00:19:45,172 --> 00:19:46,206
Hey.

501
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,908
We have a job to do.

502
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,643
This <i>is</i> my job.

503
00:19:54,716 --> 00:19:57,551
If he's asking me to
leave the premises,

504
00:19:57,553 --> 00:20:00,053
I will not until the job's done.

505
00:20:00,055 --> 00:20:02,322
Even if he'd said it,
I-I wouldn't pass it on.

506
00:20:02,324 --> 00:20:06,026
I always knew I'd have to tell
him the truth about Baghdad.

507
00:20:06,028 --> 00:20:07,294
He's not the only member
of this team.

508
00:20:07,296 --> 00:20:09,796
He cannot make
unilateral decisions.

509
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:11,765
It's his worst nightmare.

510
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:13,500
And mine, too.

511
00:20:13,502 --> 00:20:16,436
Which is why I tried to come
clean 50 times but I didn't

512
00:20:16,438 --> 00:20:17,837
have the guts.
I will do

513
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:21,675
everything I can
to help mend it. Okay?

514
00:20:21,677 --> 00:20:23,710
The last time took 16 years.

515
00:20:23,712 --> 00:20:25,579
This may be it.

516
00:20:25,581 --> 00:20:28,782
Paige. We may have something.

517
00:20:28,784 --> 00:20:30,550
If you care
to be kept apprised.

518
00:20:31,953 --> 00:20:33,687
Go.

519
00:20:37,325 --> 00:20:38,692
Okay, these are each
of the five zones

520
00:20:38,694 --> 00:20:40,293
of the building.
The threatening e-mails

521
00:20:40,295 --> 00:20:44,264
were received at
8:43, 9:39, and 11:08.

522
00:20:44,266 --> 00:20:47,567
Just before each of them
were sent, this figure

523
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:48,868
ducks into a blind spot.

524
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,937
He goes beyond the view
of cameras.

525
00:20:50,939 --> 00:20:52,539
He goes somewhere
we can't see him.

526
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,507
30 seconds later
we get an e-mail.

527
00:20:54,509 --> 00:20:56,810
Okay, run the guy
against employee files.

528
00:20:56,812 --> 00:20:58,745
Did Cabe leave?

529
00:20:58,747 --> 00:20:59,946
Is he seriously gone?

530
00:20:59,948 --> 00:21:00,914
He's outside.

531
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,515
Not going anywhere.

532
00:21:02,517 --> 00:21:04,250
Okay. We are looking

533
00:21:04,252 --> 00:21:05,719
at Dr. Simon Boyd.

534
00:21:05,721 --> 00:21:07,687
- Neurobiologist.
- We can't go in guns blazing

535
00:21:07,689 --> 00:21:09,022
on a guy just for e-mailing.

536
00:21:09,024 --> 00:21:10,824
You shouldn't go in
guns blazing at all.

537
00:21:10,826 --> 00:21:12,225
This guy works in Tox Storage.

538
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:15,028
From this office, he has
the ability to release sarin gas

539
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,364
into any test lab
in this building.

540
00:21:17,366 --> 00:21:19,199
Not just the ability

541
00:21:19,201 --> 00:21:21,067
but the desire.
High profile event,

542
00:21:21,069 --> 00:21:22,802
unattainable demands--

543
00:21:22,804 --> 00:21:24,337
this is more
of a suicide mission

544
00:21:24,339 --> 00:21:25,505
than a hostage situation.

545
00:21:25,507 --> 00:21:27,307
If he's that crazy,
I can guarantee

546
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:28,842
he's hooked up the Tox Storage

547
00:21:28,844 --> 00:21:30,510
to the entire
ventilation system.

548
00:21:30,512 --> 00:21:32,712
From the specs, it'd
be simple to do.

549
00:21:32,714 --> 00:21:35,382
All right, the only way to take back
the building and open the doors

550
00:21:35,384 --> 00:21:38,351
is to get inside and replace
the server cable that was cut.

551
00:21:38,353 --> 00:21:40,438
No one's been able
to get inside all morning.

552
00:21:40,439 --> 00:21:43,090
Yeah, that's just because we haven't
thought about it hard enough.

553
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:44,824
There's always an answer--
we just need

554
00:21:44,826 --> 00:21:46,626
to find it.
All the doors are locked,

555
00:21:46,628 --> 00:21:48,795
and I'm assuming this perp--
if he is our perp--

556
00:21:48,797 --> 00:21:50,163
is watching the
surveillance monitors.

557
00:21:50,165 --> 00:21:52,432
He is. He's got access
to all the same footage

558
00:21:52,434 --> 00:21:54,734
- that we do.
- He's absolutely our guy.

559
00:21:54,736 --> 00:21:56,403
Government records say
he started his career

560
00:21:56,405 --> 00:21:59,139
studying the effects
of neurotoxin in Baghdad

561
00:21:59,141 --> 00:22:01,708
16 years ago. He returned
from his trip to Jordan

562
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:02,910
to find his
entire neighborhood

563
00:22:02,911 --> 00:22:05,545
decimated.
Among the wounded was his

564
00:22:05,547 --> 00:22:08,314
fiancée, left comatose
and on life support

565
00:22:08,316 --> 00:22:11,017
until 18 months ago,
when she died.

566
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:12,652
Just before he began
working here.

567
00:22:12,654 --> 00:22:14,187
When he started
studying the facility,

568
00:22:14,189 --> 00:22:17,457
finding its weaknesses,
planning his revenge.

569
00:22:19,293 --> 00:22:22,062
Okay, uh, let's all
put our minds toward

570
00:22:22,064 --> 00:22:24,864
finding a way into
the building without passing

571
00:22:24,866 --> 00:22:27,434
surveillance cameras
or opening computerized

572
00:22:27,436 --> 00:22:29,269
doors or sensors.

573
00:22:29,271 --> 00:22:30,637
I know there are
lives at risk.

574
00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:32,772
But you may be
exacerbating that risk

575
00:22:32,774 --> 00:22:34,841
by sidelining
one of the team.

576
00:22:34,843 --> 00:22:37,610
I can fill the gap. He's a distraction.
He's a friend.

577
00:22:37,612 --> 00:22:40,980
Okay, I got it-- level nine
government research lab.

578
00:22:40,982 --> 00:22:43,149
It's required to burn all
its documents because shredded

579
00:22:43,151 --> 00:22:45,251
paper can always be
put back together.

580
00:22:45,253 --> 00:22:47,821
In other words, we go in through
the incinerator because

581
00:22:47,823 --> 00:22:49,622
there's no surveillance on it.
We'll have to go

582
00:22:49,624 --> 00:22:52,192
past a flame burning
at roughly 750 degrees.

583
00:22:52,194 --> 00:22:54,761
We hack the municipal gas line,
shut down the incinerator.

584
00:22:54,763 --> 00:22:57,097
Uh, residual
heat will be intense,

585
00:22:57,099 --> 00:22:59,199
so, uh, we'll need
heat-resistant suits

586
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:00,700
from the fire department.

587
00:23:00,702 --> 00:23:02,035
How are you
climbing down?

588
00:23:02,037 --> 00:23:04,137
Rope will combust,
cable or chain could

589
00:23:04,139 --> 00:23:07,207
weaken and break.

590
00:23:07,209 --> 00:23:08,775
Guys, what did Elia
give me this morning?

591
00:23:08,777 --> 00:23:11,778
Everything short of an open-mouth kiss.
A magnet. A magnet.

592
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,947
The vent's made of steel
alloy. We need magnets.

593
00:23:13,949 --> 00:23:15,415
Powerful ones.

594
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:18,051
Those news guys weren't too
thrilled that we dismantled

595
00:23:18,053 --> 00:23:19,819
their edit bays
to get these magnets.

596
00:23:19,821 --> 00:23:21,688
Yeah, well, they'll survive,
the people inside may not.

597
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,490
Sylvester, where are we?
I've got good news

598
00:23:23,492 --> 00:23:24,891
and bad.
Which first?

599
00:23:24,893 --> 00:23:26,593
Uh, the good.
Getting into the municipal system

600
00:23:26,595 --> 00:23:28,895
was a cinch.
Their password is 1234.

601
00:23:28,897 --> 00:23:30,897
The bad is,
this facility has its own

602
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:32,932
internal natural gas supply.
It's a fail-safe

603
00:23:32,934 --> 00:23:34,834
in case heat-sensitive
experiments are left running

604
00:23:34,836 --> 00:23:36,136
and the city gas goes out.

605
00:23:36,138 --> 00:23:37,837
It will also restart
the incinerator.

606
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:39,472
Shut down the backup, too.
I could control

607
00:23:39,474 --> 00:23:40,974
the backup if the server cable
was functioning,

608
00:23:40,976 --> 00:23:42,542
but it's not.
How long before the backup

609
00:23:42,544 --> 00:23:44,577
reignites the incinerator?
Three minutes

610
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:46,446
or 90 seconds,
depending on the model,

611
00:23:46,448 --> 00:23:48,381
which isn't specified
in the blueprints.

612
00:23:48,383 --> 00:23:50,083
Okay, we'll move
fast. Toby, suit up.

613
00:23:50,085 --> 00:23:51,651
Toby, stay here.

614
00:23:51,653 --> 00:23:52,986
Walter,

615
00:23:52,988 --> 00:23:54,487
you're sneaking into
a facility controlled

616
00:23:54,489 --> 00:23:56,055
by a madman.
If you were thinking

617
00:23:56,057 --> 00:23:57,457
logically, versus
emotionally,

618
00:23:57,459 --> 00:23:59,526
the person going with you
would be carrying a gun

619
00:23:59,528 --> 00:24:02,162
and know how to use it. That's Cabe.
I have to

620
00:24:02,164 --> 00:24:04,831
go in with someone I can trust.
Cabe is deceitful and deceptive.

621
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,366
Okay, we'll talk later
about the number of times

622
00:24:06,368 --> 00:24:08,868
he's proved otherwise.
Right now you cannot save anyone

623
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:11,471
if you're killed the second
you enter the building.

624
00:24:12,807 --> 00:24:14,440
Consider the greater good.

625
00:24:16,143 --> 00:24:20,213
All right. Just say the word
when you're ready.

626
00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:23,650
My own
personal invention:

627
00:24:23,652 --> 00:24:26,686
a soldering pen,
or flip the switch...

628
00:24:26,688 --> 00:24:29,189
and it cuts faster
than an arc torch.

629
00:24:29,191 --> 00:24:31,925
You'll be able to patch
the network cable in no time.

630
00:24:31,927 --> 00:24:34,861
These have a flux output of N52,

631
00:24:34,863 --> 00:24:37,263
so it's gonna take all the upper
arm strength you've got.

632
00:24:37,265 --> 00:24:38,364
It'll be just like
rock climbing.

633
00:24:38,366 --> 00:24:42,068
On magnets. Down a...
blazing hot metal tube.

634
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,737
Why don't we get moving, okay?
Comm's in, everyone.

635
00:24:44,739 --> 00:24:45,972
Got it.

636
00:24:45,974 --> 00:24:48,041
Hey. Good luck.

637
00:24:48,043 --> 00:24:49,609
Gonna need it.

638
00:24:49,611 --> 00:24:51,744
Sylvester, kill the gas.

639
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:07,894
Walter.
Just keep

640
00:25:07,896 --> 00:25:09,662
conversations
to the bare essentials.

641
00:25:09,664 --> 00:25:11,464
How many times do we have
to save each other's lives

642
00:25:11,466 --> 00:25:13,900
before you realize I'm not the
same guy that made that mistake?

643
00:25:13,902 --> 00:25:15,134
I said only the bare essentials.

644
00:25:15,136 --> 00:25:16,736
Grow the hell up.
People might

645
00:25:16,738 --> 00:25:18,171
die here today and you're
only thinking about

646
00:25:18,173 --> 00:25:20,907
yourself.
Thanks to you,

647
00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:23,409
I don't sleep.
Recurring nightmares...

648
00:25:23,411 --> 00:25:25,511
You think you're the only
one that has those dreams?

649
00:25:25,513 --> 00:25:27,580
You guys are gonna need to fight
later, because the incinerator

650
00:25:27,582 --> 00:25:29,215
just turned back on.

651
00:25:31,752 --> 00:25:34,387
Evidently we're dealing with
the 90-second model. Aah!

652
00:25:34,389 --> 00:25:36,890
Our suits won't protect us
long under these new conditions.

653
00:25:36,892 --> 00:25:39,893
We need to climb up
and regroup.

654
00:25:39,895 --> 00:25:41,127
Walter.

655
00:25:41,129 --> 00:25:43,563
My magnets are slipping.

656
00:25:43,565 --> 00:25:44,898
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's happening in there?

657
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,300
Excessive heat
causes atoms to speed up,

658
00:25:47,302 --> 00:25:49,435
decreasing
magnetic domains. This

659
00:25:49,437 --> 00:25:50,570
lack of cohesion

660
00:25:50,572 --> 00:25:52,205
weakens magnetic force.

661
00:25:52,207 --> 00:25:56,142
Cut the science lesson. I'm
headed toward a burning furnace!

662
00:26:05,594 --> 00:26:07,928
Walter, I'm losing ground here.

663
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,697
It's 'cause you're
heavier than me.

664
00:26:09,699 --> 00:26:12,333
Guys, we got to come up
with a solution fast.

665
00:26:12,335 --> 00:26:13,767
Okay, they can't go down,
we can't reach them

666
00:26:13,769 --> 00:26:16,704
to pull them back up.
Through the side?

667
00:26:16,706 --> 00:26:17,872
Just throwing ideas out, here.

668
00:26:17,874 --> 00:26:19,773
No, no, that's
brilliant. Walt,

669
00:26:19,775 --> 00:26:22,910
the soldering pen. Slide the
handle switch to torch mode

670
00:26:22,912 --> 00:26:25,079
and it should slice the vent wall.
Leading to what?

671
00:26:25,081 --> 00:26:27,815
If there's a concrete wall
beside the vent it doesn't help.

672
00:26:27,817 --> 00:26:30,084
And that is what's
beside the vent, unless you're

673
00:26:30,086 --> 00:26:32,820
17 feet down from the vent
opening facing north,

674
00:26:32,822 --> 00:26:34,455
where there is a crawl space.

675
00:26:34,457 --> 00:26:36,957
Okay, I put you
about 15 feet down.

676
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:39,393
And, uh, north
is toward me.

677
00:26:39,395 --> 00:26:42,062
Okay. Okay.

678
00:26:42,064 --> 00:26:44,265
I need a hand free
to operate the torch.

679
00:26:44,267 --> 00:26:45,866
Come on, come on, come on.

680
00:26:45,868 --> 00:26:47,568
Ooh, ooh. Oh.

681
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,535
Walter.

682
00:26:51,073 --> 00:26:53,040
Walter, I'm headed
towards oblivion.

683
00:26:53,042 --> 00:26:55,042
When you get to my foot,
grab hold

684
00:26:55,044 --> 00:26:57,745
and I'll pull you up into
the hole when it's cut.

685
00:26:57,747 --> 00:27:00,547
My weight'll pull you down.
So only grab hold of my foot

686
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:03,517
after I get a grip on the cut

687
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:04,885
inside the vent shaft.

688
00:27:04,887 --> 00:27:06,754
All right, here we go.

689
00:27:17,532 --> 00:27:18,899
Kid, where you going?

690
00:27:18,901 --> 00:27:20,901
I'm part of the Scorpion team.

691
00:27:20,903 --> 00:27:23,170
No, this is no place
for you. Come with me.

692
00:27:23,172 --> 00:27:26,106
Sit in my squad car
until I can call your mom.

693
00:27:27,909 --> 00:27:29,209
I got a schoolkid here.

694
00:27:32,982 --> 00:27:35,082
Aah! The heat
is becoming untenable.

695
00:27:36,351 --> 00:27:39,453
Oh, geez. The vent temperature
is nearing 400 degrees.

696
00:27:39,455 --> 00:27:42,189
Kid, I got a few seconds, then
you're gonna be out of reach.

697
00:27:42,191 --> 00:27:44,291
I need more time.
I don't think we have any.

698
00:27:44,293 --> 00:27:46,160
And if that's the case, hear me out.
I have no

699
00:27:46,162 --> 00:27:47,695
intention
of listening to another

700
00:27:47,697 --> 00:27:49,396
apology right now,
'cause we're

701
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:51,332
getting out of here.

702
00:27:56,705 --> 00:27:57,838
Aah!

703
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,510
Grab onto my foot.

704
00:28:03,512 --> 00:28:06,046
I can't reach it.
Grab on to my foot, climb up.

705
00:28:06,048 --> 00:28:08,182
I... I can't grab it.

706
00:28:10,686 --> 00:28:12,052
Come on, come on.

707
00:28:12,054 --> 00:28:14,421
Come on.

708
00:28:14,423 --> 00:28:16,690
Come on, Cabe!

709
00:28:21,062 --> 00:28:23,163
Come on.

710
00:28:23,165 --> 00:28:24,398
Climb up now!

711
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Come on.

712
00:28:26,402 --> 00:28:29,036
Get up.

713
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:32,039
Come on.
They're in.

714
00:28:36,846 --> 00:28:39,513
Thank you, Walter.
Thank you.

715
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,351
We're not finished yet.

716
00:28:44,353 --> 00:28:46,653
Sylvester, lead us
to the server hub.

717
00:28:46,655 --> 00:28:49,823
Come on.

718
00:28:49,825 --> 00:28:53,527
Simon's out of frame again.
I'm guessing he's about

719
00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:55,329
to put our feet
to the fire.

720
00:28:55,331 --> 00:28:58,265
So to speak.

721
00:28:58,267 --> 00:29:01,068
Incoming e-mail.
"You have five minutes to prove

722
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,637
"the president will meet
my demands on live television

723
00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:05,239
"or the hostages are dead.

724
00:29:05,241 --> 00:29:08,075
You have five minutes
until I kill these people."

725
00:29:08,077 --> 00:29:09,376
Walter and Cabe
are at the server hub.

726
00:29:09,378 --> 00:29:10,911
It's up there,
it's up there.

727
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,621
How long?

728
00:29:13,645 --> 00:29:15,883
The server cable will be
repaired in 30 seconds.

729
00:29:16,419 --> 00:29:19,286
Then Sylvester can regain
control of the building. Get to

730
00:29:19,288 --> 00:29:21,188
Zone 5, evacuate
the hostages, then Zone 4,

731
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,489
et cetera, et cetera.

732
00:29:22,491 --> 00:29:24,124
Not to be the voice of doom, but

733
00:29:24,126 --> 00:29:27,895
there's just over four minutes
until Simon releases the sarin.

734
00:29:27,897 --> 00:29:29,497
And he's not looking
at the monitors, so,

735
00:29:29,498 --> 00:29:30,931
Cabe, you need to move now.

736
00:29:30,933 --> 00:29:33,567
Okay, I'll find Simon, keep
him away from the monitors,

737
00:29:33,569 --> 00:29:35,269
and you evacuate the hostages.

738
00:29:35,271 --> 00:29:37,304
The man's psychotic.
I handle the face-to-face.

739
00:29:37,306 --> 00:29:38,806
You know the
evacuation protocols

740
00:29:38,808 --> 00:29:40,808
better than I do. In two minutes
I could probably figure them out

741
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:44,611
and improve them, but it's time
that we don't have. Cabe, go.

742
00:29:47,682 --> 00:29:50,384
Cabe, stay tight to the wall.
You need to hug the corner

743
00:29:50,386 --> 00:29:53,454
to your left. In front of you
should be the door to the lab.

744
00:29:53,456 --> 00:29:56,136
The Zone 5 hostages are in that room.
Hey, help! Get us out of here!

745
00:29:56,858 --> 00:29:57,991
The server's repaired.

746
00:29:57,993 --> 00:30:01,728
Sylvester, you should have
control of the facility.

747
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,964
I think... I've got it.
The building's ours.

748
00:30:03,966 --> 00:30:06,300
One minute till he
gasses the building.

749
00:30:06,302 --> 00:30:08,268
Walter, you got to hustle
to Simon

750
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,070
or I won't be able
to get these people out.

751
00:30:10,072 --> 00:30:12,940
He's playing the role of
hostage, so you play your role.

752
00:30:12,942 --> 00:30:14,208
Walter, he sees you.

753
00:30:15,143 --> 00:30:16,310
Hey.

754
00:30:16,312 --> 00:30:18,679
Who are you?

755
00:30:18,681 --> 00:30:20,114
I'm with SWAT.

756
00:30:20,116 --> 00:30:21,548
We're trying to figure out
a way to get

757
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,716
everyone out of here.

758
00:30:22,718 --> 00:30:23,817
Simon's not facing the monitors.

759
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:26,019
Now, Cabe.

760
00:30:26,955 --> 00:30:29,623
Everybody, move fast, move fast.

761
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:31,458
How did you get in?
I sawed a hole

762
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:35,028
in the wall of the
incinerator exhaust.

763
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,831
Alone?

764
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:39,299
One-man rescue team?

765
00:30:39,301 --> 00:30:41,001
That's right.
I'm a recon scout.

766
00:30:47,675 --> 00:30:50,210
Those are the mechanical
overrides, Walter.

767
00:30:50,212 --> 00:30:51,512
He can still
release the sarin gas

768
00:30:51,514 --> 00:30:53,814
even though we have control
of the computer system.

769
00:30:53,816 --> 00:30:55,382
Sly, open the door.

770
00:30:55,384 --> 00:30:58,352
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
It's me you want.

771
00:30:58,354 --> 00:31:00,053
I killed your fiancée.

772
00:31:01,589 --> 00:31:04,158
I was responsible
for what happened in Baghdad.

773
00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:10,164
You... are lying to me.

774
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:15,502
I was the programming contractor
who designed

775
00:31:15,504 --> 00:31:17,104
the targeting system

776
00:31:17,106 --> 00:31:19,006
for the bombs
that killed your fiancée

777
00:31:19,008 --> 00:31:20,574
and everyone else.

778
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,043
It's me you want.

779
00:31:23,045 --> 00:31:25,212
These people are innocent.

780
00:31:25,214 --> 00:31:27,047
No.

781
00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:30,184
No, what I want
is justice for Daliyah.

782
00:31:30,186 --> 00:31:33,887
And that...
you can't give to me.

783
00:31:33,889 --> 00:31:34,889
Gun.

784
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:40,227
You're not gonna shoot anyone.

785
00:31:40,229 --> 00:31:43,697
You don't want there to be
any more casualties from today

786
00:31:43,699 --> 00:31:45,799
from that bombing.

787
00:31:45,801 --> 00:31:48,202
Now, you're distraught

788
00:31:48,204 --> 00:31:50,904
over your loss.
Simon, I get it.

789
00:31:50,906 --> 00:31:52,773
But you're not a bad man.

790
00:31:52,775 --> 00:31:54,975
Zone 3 is evaced.

791
00:31:54,977 --> 00:31:57,511
I'm all clear here.
I got to go help Walter.

792
00:31:57,513 --> 00:31:58,845
You keep evacuating the others.

793
00:31:58,847 --> 00:32:00,314
Who are you talking to?

794
00:32:00,316 --> 00:32:02,516
Give me that
earpiece.

795
00:32:02,518 --> 00:32:04,952
Now.

796
00:32:04,954 --> 00:32:07,120
Now!

797
00:32:13,328 --> 00:32:14,895
The world

798
00:32:14,897 --> 00:32:18,398
is now gonna see
how she suffered.

799
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,800
Simon, listen to me.

800
00:32:21,736 --> 00:32:23,103
Simon, stop!

801
00:32:23,105 --> 00:32:24,605
He released the sarin.

802
00:32:24,607 --> 00:32:26,807
Now I'm gonna take him outside

803
00:32:26,809 --> 00:32:28,342
and kill this man on live TV!

804
00:32:28,344 --> 00:32:30,611
Move!
Okay.

805
00:32:32,046 --> 00:32:33,714
Uh, guys, the gas

806
00:32:33,716 --> 00:32:36,216
is in Zone 5, which means
you have less than five minutes

807
00:32:36,218 --> 00:32:38,885
to get out of the building.

808
00:32:40,755 --> 00:32:43,991
Sarah, we have to go.

809
00:32:43,993 --> 00:32:45,659
I can't leave him.
There's nothing you

810
00:32:45,661 --> 00:32:48,028
can do for him.
Simon's released the gas.

811
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,930
If it's coming through
the ventilation system,

812
00:32:49,932 --> 00:32:51,465
it kicks on zone by zone,

813
00:32:51,467 --> 00:32:52,666
one at a time
so it doesn't overload.

814
00:32:52,668 --> 00:32:53,934
What zone goes first?

815
00:32:53,936 --> 00:32:55,235
5 down to 1.

816
00:32:55,237 --> 00:32:56,536
Walter's in Zone 1.
How much time do we have?

817
00:32:56,538 --> 00:32:58,572
Only about a minute
per zone. Tops!

818
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:27,100
By the time Walter and Simon
are outside,

819
00:33:27,102 --> 00:33:29,036
I want sharpshooters on the
bluff across the street

820
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:30,770
and the rooftop on the other
side of the parking lot.

821
00:33:30,794 --> 00:33:31,673
No way.

822
00:33:31,674 --> 00:33:33,573
I'm three minutes away
from bugging everyone out

823
00:33:33,575 --> 00:33:35,208
for a mile radius of here.

824
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:37,678
The incinerator's vent
has a hole that you made.

825
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,880
So once the gas
is released into Zone 1,

826
00:33:39,882 --> 00:33:42,549
it can escape from the vents
and kill all of us.

827
00:33:43,351 --> 00:33:45,185
What was that?
Is that a person?

828
00:33:45,187 --> 00:33:46,753
Where?

829
00:33:46,755 --> 00:33:49,256
Middle camera, moving north.
There.

830
00:33:49,258 --> 00:33:51,124
Oh, my God.

831
00:33:53,261 --> 00:33:54,628
That's Ralph.

832
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,863
Ralph is in the building!

833
00:34:04,226 --> 00:34:05,727
How the hell
did he get in there?

834
00:34:05,729 --> 00:34:07,261
What is he doing in there?!

835
00:34:07,263 --> 00:34:08,563
Paige, you don't know
where you're going!

836
00:34:08,565 --> 00:34:09,697
Happy!

837
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:11,666
He's heading north into Zone 1.

838
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:13,301
What the hell
is he thinking?

839
00:34:13,303 --> 00:34:14,569
No idea, but he is crawling

840
00:34:14,571 --> 00:34:16,571
into a vent shaft that leads
to the crawl space

841
00:34:16,573 --> 00:34:18,640
that Walter and Cabe
took from

842
00:34:18,642 --> 00:34:20,742
- the incinerator vent.
- Oh, man.

843
00:34:20,744 --> 00:34:22,944
He knows that if that gas
is released in Zone 1,

844
00:34:22,946 --> 00:34:24,245
it will escape through the hole
in the vent.

845
00:34:24,247 --> 00:34:25,480
He's trying to save the city.

846
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:28,149
Oh, uh, Sly, Walter fixed
the server hub.

847
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:30,118
You shut down
the incinerator now!

848
00:34:32,554 --> 00:34:34,222
I have spent my life
since the bombing raids

849
00:34:34,224 --> 00:34:35,523
trying to atone for the deaths.

850
00:34:35,525 --> 00:34:37,191
I will not rest
until I have saved

851
00:34:37,193 --> 00:34:38,660
at least that number
that have died.

852
00:34:38,662 --> 00:34:40,895
Please do not add any more lives
to that list.

853
00:34:40,897 --> 00:34:42,096
It's already too late.

854
00:34:42,098 --> 00:34:43,431
The incinerator is shut off.

855
00:34:43,433 --> 00:34:44,932
But I can't see Ralph.
He's off the surveillance grid.

856
00:34:44,934 --> 00:34:48,202
Once the gas is released
into Zone 1, how long before

857
00:34:48,204 --> 00:34:49,704
it escapes through
the incinerator hole?

858
00:34:49,706 --> 00:34:51,439
With average seepage rates,
48 seconds.

859
00:34:51,441 --> 00:34:54,008
I'm calling an evac!

860
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,077
Kid, get off your ass, let's go.

861
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,046
You can go, I will not.

862
00:34:59,783 --> 00:35:02,383
Come on, people, move it.
Let's go, let's go.

863
00:35:21,737 --> 00:35:24,906
Sorry, Sylvester.

864
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:33,214
Ralph! Ralph!

865
00:35:33,216 --> 00:35:34,449
Mom, I'm almost done!

866
00:35:36,685 --> 00:35:39,454
He's melting the silicone
rubber to seal the hole.

867
00:35:39,456 --> 00:35:40,788
That kid is brilliant.

868
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:41,889
Okay, without
a thermal fire suit,

869
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:42,857
even with the incinerator off,

870
00:35:42,859 --> 00:35:45,093
the heat in the vent
is 128 degrees.

871
00:35:45,095 --> 00:35:46,761
A kid Ralph's age
won't last long.

872
00:35:46,763 --> 00:35:49,130
Ralph, you need to climb out
right now!

873
00:35:49,132 --> 00:35:50,631
Right now!

874
00:35:50,633 --> 00:35:51,899
I'm begging you.

875
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:53,401
Please don't let
any more blood spill

876
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:54,836
over this Baghdad tragedy.

877
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:57,772
As soon as you step outside,
you're done, you son of a bitch.

878
00:35:57,774 --> 00:35:59,941
Cabe, we are running out
of time.

879
00:35:59,943 --> 00:36:02,643
There's only ten seconds
until the gas reaches Zone 1.

880
00:36:02,645 --> 00:36:04,779
You're so concerned
for your own life.

881
00:36:04,781 --> 00:36:07,548
Could you imagine if
you cared about other people,

882
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,050
thousands would still be alive.

883
00:36:09,052 --> 00:36:11,018
I wasn't talking about my life.

884
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,620
I was talking about yours.

885
00:36:22,966 --> 00:36:24,165
Nice job, son.

886
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:25,533
Drop your gun!
Drop your gun!

887
00:36:25,535 --> 00:36:26,701
Kick it away! I'll
figure out a way

888
00:36:26,703 --> 00:36:28,302
to get you out
of there alive!

889
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:30,705
Listen to me!

890
00:36:30,707 --> 00:36:31,806
I don't want you to die!

891
00:36:31,808 --> 00:36:32,940
Two seconds, Cabe.

892
00:36:32,942 --> 00:36:33,942
I don't want you to die!

893
00:36:33,943 --> 00:36:36,944
Listen to me!
Drop the gun!

894
00:36:37,846 --> 00:36:39,514
I don't want you to die!

895
00:36:50,692 --> 00:36:52,860
Almost, honey.

896
00:36:52,862 --> 00:36:54,228
You're doing great.

897
00:36:56,331 --> 00:36:59,000
Oh, God.
Sly, the incinerator!

898
00:36:59,002 --> 00:37:00,535
Someone must've pulled
the server cable again

899
00:37:00,537 --> 00:37:02,203
because everything reset!

900
00:37:02,205 --> 00:37:04,372
Faster, Ralph! Climb faster!

901
00:37:06,108 --> 00:37:09,043
Ralph, climb faster.
Come on, come on.

902
00:37:09,045 --> 00:37:10,711
Come on.
Whoa.

903
00:37:10,713 --> 00:37:12,780
Ralph!
The magnets!

904
00:37:12,782 --> 00:37:14,215
Ralph, faster, climb!

905
00:37:14,217 --> 00:37:15,283
I can't!

906
00:37:15,285 --> 00:37:17,185
Lower me down. Lower me down.

907
00:37:17,187 --> 00:37:18,452
Whoa!
Ralph,

908
00:37:18,454 --> 00:37:19,687
grab my hand.

909
00:37:19,689 --> 00:37:20,788
Lower!

910
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:23,324
Okay, pull me up!

911
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:24,759
Come on, I got you.

912
00:37:25,861 --> 00:37:27,695
Come on. Oh, my God.

913
00:37:28,598 --> 00:37:30,798
What the
hell were you thinking?!

914
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,733
I had to help.
For the greater good.

915
00:37:32,735 --> 00:37:34,468
I'm part of the team.

916
00:37:41,577 --> 00:37:43,311
Oh, God.

917
00:37:45,914 --> 00:37:48,049
Hazmat should have this
building cleaned up

918
00:37:48,051 --> 00:37:49,951
and operative
in a week.

919
00:37:49,953 --> 00:37:51,452
Wrap it up.

920
00:37:51,454 --> 00:37:55,790
Now let's discuss this, uh,
personnel change you demanded.

921
00:37:55,792 --> 00:37:57,758
Hey, Walter!

922
00:37:58,861 --> 00:37:59,994
Hey.

923
00:37:59,996 --> 00:38:01,529
Hey, take care of him.

924
00:38:01,531 --> 00:38:03,431
We'll finish up tomorrow.
Okay.

925
00:38:03,433 --> 00:38:05,132
Let me see it.

926
00:38:05,134 --> 00:38:07,401
Oh, that's the way
a champion looks.

927
00:38:07,403 --> 00:38:09,637
Give me that.

928
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:11,806
You did a great job.

929
00:38:19,414 --> 00:38:20,915
Okay, buddy, let's go.

930
00:38:20,917 --> 00:38:23,217
Nice work.
Was it?

931
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:26,120
I saw two more dead
added to the list.

932
00:38:26,122 --> 00:38:29,056
Kid, what happened
when you were 16--

933
00:38:29,058 --> 00:38:32,026
it's the worst thing
I ever did in my life.

934
00:38:32,028 --> 00:38:33,661
I regret nothing more.

935
00:38:33,663 --> 00:38:35,162
I'm not your kid.

936
00:38:35,164 --> 00:38:37,131
Not anymore.

937
00:38:42,471 --> 00:38:44,572
Fine.

938
00:38:44,574 --> 00:38:46,407
Then I'll resign

939
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:49,343
from Scorpion
effective immediately.

940
00:38:56,718 --> 00:38:59,854
<i>Once again, the government</i>
<i>contractors known as Scorpion</i>

941
00:38:59,856 --> 00:39:01,656
<i>have used</i>
<i>their incredible abilities</i>

942
00:39:01,658 --> 00:39:04,158
<i>to save lives</i>
<i>against staggering odds.</i>

943
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,693
One can only imagine the pride

944
00:39:05,695 --> 00:39:08,663
and sense of accomplishment
they must be feeling right now,

945
00:39:08,665 --> 00:39:11,198
and what's in store for
this unique group of geniuses.

946
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,968
Cabe will be coming
back for these--

947
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:15,536
government case files.

948
00:39:15,538 --> 00:39:18,339
For shredding,
just like our income.

949
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:22,009
We will survive, thrive even.

950
00:39:22,011 --> 00:39:24,278
Is there really no way
that he's coming back?

951
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,881
I mean... ever?

952
00:39:26,883 --> 00:39:28,683
Trust was our only bond,

953
00:39:28,685 --> 00:39:31,085
and that's been eroded
way too far.

954
00:39:31,087 --> 00:39:33,054
I don't like being a pessimist.

955
00:39:33,056 --> 00:39:34,388
You're always a pessimist.

956
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:36,057
But him leaving...

957
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:37,558
Walt, it's...

958
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,226
not good.

959
00:39:40,062 --> 00:39:40,962
How's the boy?

960
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:44,799
Uh, resting
with his dad.

961
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:46,867
Walter?

962
00:39:46,869 --> 00:39:48,402
Yeah.

963
00:39:52,107 --> 00:39:53,808
I can tell that
you're, uh, concerned

964
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:57,511
about, uh, Cabe's, uh,
departure, but I, uh...

965
00:39:57,513 --> 00:40:00,014
You know it wasn't him who
made this team coalesce.

966
00:40:00,016 --> 00:40:01,549
It was you.

967
00:40:01,551 --> 00:40:04,618
I don't think
I can be here anymore.

968
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:07,722
Can you repeat
that, please?

969
00:40:07,724 --> 00:40:10,825
Ralph... admires you,
worships you...

970
00:40:10,827 --> 00:40:12,360
Uh-huh.

971
00:40:12,362 --> 00:40:15,162
...copies everything you do,

972
00:40:15,164 --> 00:40:17,732
including putting himself
in mortal danger.

973
00:40:17,734 --> 00:40:22,136
I-I don't think
being here is safe.

974
00:40:22,138 --> 00:40:24,638
Drew was offered

975
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,141
a coaching job in Maine.

976
00:40:27,143 --> 00:40:29,210
I'm going
to recommend he take it.

977
00:40:29,212 --> 00:40:30,978
And you'd go with him?

978
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,414
We would move to Maine, yes.

979
00:40:35,784 --> 00:40:38,853
I appreciate everything
you've done for us.

980
00:40:38,855 --> 00:40:40,855
Do you see what
you're sacrificing by leaving,

981
00:40:40,857 --> 00:40:42,556
by taking Ralph away from us?

982
00:40:42,558 --> 00:40:45,026
I have to think of his safety.

983
00:40:45,028 --> 00:40:47,294
Earlier today, you
invoked the greater good

984
00:40:47,296 --> 00:40:49,463
so that I would
team up with Cabe.

985
00:40:49,465 --> 00:40:51,699
But do you just throw
that term around?

986
00:40:51,701 --> 00:40:54,935
My son nearly died
because he wants to be you.

987
00:40:54,937 --> 00:40:57,772
Is it so awful being me?
Being around me?

988
00:40:57,774 --> 00:40:59,540
I just don't want him
to become you!

989
00:41:02,044 --> 00:41:04,311
What is your solution?

990
00:41:04,313 --> 00:41:06,347
Keep him in a cocoon?

991
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:09,984
Have him watch you move to Maine
to follow some guy

992
00:41:09,986 --> 00:41:11,585
who's already abandoned
you? That's idiotic!

993
00:41:11,587 --> 00:41:13,587
That guy is his father, Walter.

994
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:16,223
You are not.
I... I have to go.

995
00:41:26,034 --> 00:41:28,202
Good-bye, guys.

996
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,456
I don't need her.
I don't need Cabe.

997
00:42:09,511 --> 00:42:12,079
Yeah!

998
00:42:23,126 --> 00:42:24,859
Oh, oh!
