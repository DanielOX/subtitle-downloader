1
00:00:04,813 --> 00:00:06,481
<i>My name is Walter O'Brien.</i>

2
00:00:06,483 --> 00:00:10,852
<i>I have the fourth highest IQ</i>
<i><i><i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

3
00:00:10,854 --> 00:00:12,654
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

4
00:00:12,656 --> 00:00:15,189
<i>When I was 11,
the FBI</i> <i>arrested me for hacking NASA</i>

5
00:00:15,191 --> 00:00:17,892
<i>to get their blueprints</i> <i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

6
00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:20,094
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

7
00:00:20,096 --> 00:00:21,562
<i>tackling worldwide threats</i>

8
00:00:21,564 --> 00:00:23,064
<i>only we can solve.</i>

9
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:24,832
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

10
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:26,634
<i>Sylvester's a human calculator.</i>

11
00:00:26,636 --> 00:00:28,936
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

12
00:00:28,938 --> 00:00:31,138
<i>Agent Cabe Gallo's</i> <i>our government handler.</i>

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,374
<i>And Paige?</i> <i>Well, Paige isn't like us.</i>

14
00:00:33,376 --> 00:00:35,843
<i>She's normal</i> <i>and translates the world for us</i>

15
00:00:35,845 --> 00:00:38,512
<i>while we help her understand</i> <i>her genius son.</i>

16
00:00:38,514 --> 00:00:40,615
<i>Together, we are Scorpion.</i>

17
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,430
Now!

18
00:01:29,432 --> 00:01:30,898
On the ground!

19
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,332
Do it right now!

20
00:01:34,435 --> 00:01:38,372
I want to talk to Walter O'Brien!

21
00:01:43,244 --> 00:01:45,579
I said we could come in for
an hour before school started.

22
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:47,614
That ended five minutes ago, bud.

23
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:51,418
Ralph, did you even touch your breakfast?

24
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,919
To move it over.

25
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:55,389
Hey, I gave you your own set
of Allen wrenches for a reason.

26
00:01:58,427 --> 00:02:00,794
I have them set by lens strength.

27
00:02:00,796 --> 00:02:01,661
Ah, well done.

28
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,396
First optics test is you check

29
00:02:03,398 --> 00:02:04,498
for spherical aberration.

30
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,499
Actually, the first test

31
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:06,833
he needs to do is long division.

32
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,168
So, he can't be late for school.

33
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,136
Do you really think we
need a test to determine

34
00:02:10,138 --> 00:02:11,705
if he knows long division?

35
00:02:11,707 --> 00:02:14,341
Point taken,
but he still needs to be at school on time.

36
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:16,109
Go downstairs and get your backpack.
Come on.

37
00:02:16,111 --> 00:02:18,345
Can we run the test together after school?

38
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:19,846
Can't wait.

39
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,818
I'll be back in 20... what... what is that?

40
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,419
It's a centrifuge.

41
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:28,022
So, you guys have been up here for hours,

42
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,023
no breaks,
and I'll assume you skipped breakfast.

43
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:30,990
We're working here.

44
00:02:30,992 --> 00:02:32,125
Ralph does the same thing.

45
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:33,593
Well, focus is normal

46
00:02:33,595 --> 00:02:34,994
when someone...

47
00:02:34,996 --> 00:02:36,262
“Goes down the rabbit hole”"

48
00:02:36,264 --> 00:02:37,464
You'll know.

49
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:38,665
What's a rabbit hole?

50
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:41,134
Dehydration, loss of sense of time,

51
00:02:41,136 --> 00:02:42,669
antisocial behavior.

52
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:44,470
And how do you avoid that?

53
00:02:44,472 --> 00:02:47,032
You avoid it by starting
a team like Scorpion.

54
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:49,409
Come, here.

55
00:02:51,712 --> 00:02:55,515
I'm seeing... ace of spades.

56
00:02:55,517 --> 00:02:56,883
Wait a minute.

57
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,052
You think you're sneaky, huh?

58
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,887
I've never seen him happier.

59
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,755
He's in the right place.

60
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:04,524
This isn't your card?!

61
00:03:04,526 --> 00:03:05,391
Is this your card?

62
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,893
Car, now.

63
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,860
Ralph.

64
00:03:07,862 --> 00:03:08,961
Have a good day at school.

65
00:03:08,963 --> 00:03:11,043
And don't listen to any of your teachers.

66
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:12,932
Happy.

67
00:03:12,934 --> 00:03:15,501
Pick one... 20 bucks says I can
guess it in under five seconds.

68
00:03:15,503 --> 00:03:17,703
Is this your way of asking for a loan?

69
00:03:18,126 --> 00:03:20,027
You blew your money, didn't you?

70
00:03:20,842 --> 00:03:23,509
Your ex-fiancée told you
to never call her again,

71
00:03:23,511 --> 00:03:25,444
and you licked your wounds at a card table?

72
00:03:25,446 --> 00:03:26,512
Wrong.

73
00:03:26,514 --> 00:03:27,780
Cleaned up at a card table.

74
00:03:27,782 --> 00:03:29,515
I got killed at craps.

75
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:31,650
Perhaps next time I should just call you.

76
00:03:31,652 --> 00:03:32,752
Absolutely wrong.

77
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,087
Not that I would, but if I did,

78
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,590
what exactly would be so wrong about that?

79
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:40,793
We don't have the time.

80
00:03:40,795 --> 00:03:42,595
See, that's why I gamble.

81
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,731
Walter! Why the hell aren't
you answering your phone?

82
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:47,566
I was working!

83
00:03:47,568 --> 00:03:49,134
I need you to come with me.

84
00:03:49,136 --> 00:03:50,369
Just you. Urgent.

85
00:03:50,371 --> 00:03:51,503
What is it?

86
00:03:51,505 --> 00:03:54,073
You know the name Mark Collins?

87
00:03:54,908 --> 00:03:56,742
Yeah.

88
00:03:57,644 --> 00:04:01,180
Let's keep this quiet.

89
00:04:02,382 --> 00:04:04,083
Collins breached the
unmarked perimeter

90
00:04:04,085 --> 00:04:07,519
at the military-controlled
Montero Nuclear Reactor,

91
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:09,054
about five miles from here.

92
00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:10,556
Did he say why he did it?

93
00:04:10,558 --> 00:04:12,925
All he's said so far is your name.

94
00:04:12,927 --> 00:04:14,326
Wonder why that is.

95
00:04:14,328 --> 00:04:17,429
I haven't talked to him in years.

96
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:19,031
General Ned Walker.

97
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:20,599
The reactor's under his command.

98
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:21,700
Mr. O'Brien.

99
00:04:21,702 --> 00:04:23,735
Anything you can do to determine his intent

100
00:04:23,737 --> 00:04:25,704
and threat level would be a huge help.

101
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:27,706
I'd like to get this buttoned
up as soon as possible.

102
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:28,774
How active is the reactor?

103
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:30,242
Not at all...

104
00:04:30,244 --> 00:04:32,144
it's been decommissioned and
scheduled to be dismantled.

105
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,579
Basically, all we do is security.

106
00:04:34,581 --> 00:04:36,501
Now, how do you know Mr. Collins?

107
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,852
Mark used to work at my company, Scorpion.

108
00:04:56,802 --> 00:04:58,637
Hi, Walter. Mark.

109
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,272
So, what's going on here?

110
00:05:00,274 --> 00:05:02,107
782.

111
00:05:02,109 --> 00:05:03,575
What's that supposed to mean?

112
00:05:03,577 --> 00:05:06,044
You have the second sharpest
brain in the room, use it.

113
00:05:06,046 --> 00:05:07,012
782.

114
00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:08,146
What, is that some kind of code?

115
00:05:08,148 --> 00:05:09,647
No, it's not code, it's days.

116
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:11,216
782 days since we saw each other.

117
00:05:11,218 --> 00:05:13,618
Mark, these people aren't messing about.

118
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,121
Please, tell me...
why did you trespass at the reactor?

119
00:05:16,123 --> 00:05:17,489
And why did you ask for me?

120
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:19,190
You're working with the Feds now.

121
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:20,825
I also heard about that close call you had

122
00:05:20,827 --> 00:05:22,927
with the governor on that biohacking thing.

123
00:05:22,929 --> 00:05:23,928
That wasn't reported.

124
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,096
How'd you hear about that?

125
00:05:25,098 --> 00:05:27,565
No, he means, literally he heard it.

126
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:29,968
Mark's a radio... expert.

127
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,637
It's okay, you can say “hacker”"

128
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,707
He monitors nearly every signal
that passes through the air.

129
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:38,076
From truckers on CBs, to cell phone calls,

130
00:05:38,078 --> 00:05:40,511
to military communications.

131
00:05:40,513 --> 00:05:43,281
How long have you been spying on us?

132
00:05:43,283 --> 00:05:45,316
Yes, please, Mr. Government,

133
00:05:45,318 --> 00:05:48,486
go ahead and tell me
again how bad spying is.

134
00:05:49,688 --> 00:05:51,289
Mark.

135
00:05:52,057 --> 00:05:53,758
How's your head?

136
00:05:55,127 --> 00:05:56,694
Are we on solid ground now?

137
00:05:56,696 --> 00:05:58,696
I could ask you the same thing, Walter.

138
00:05:59,831 --> 00:06:01,566
But, yes, I'm as clear as a bell.

139
00:06:01,568 --> 00:06:04,535
And I'm 100% sure that there's a problem.

140
00:06:04,537 --> 00:06:06,738
I mean, come on,
I wouldn't expect these normals

141
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:08,606
to understand...

142
00:06:08,608 --> 00:06:12,643
851.67, 851.69.

143
00:06:12,645 --> 00:06:16,914
With a moderate isolation scheme
I achieved a ten to the second,

144
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,549
ten to the fifth uptick in BER.

145
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:21,127
What is he babbling about?

146
00:06:21,153 --> 00:06:23,888
632, black.

147
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,257
646, green.

148
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:28,025
March 25.

149
00:06:28,027 --> 00:06:30,302
You with me, Walter?

150
00:06:30,328 --> 00:06:32,897
I knew I could count on you.

151
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:34,231
All right, there's not much time.

152
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:37,268
Need you to get to my house,
and open the notebooks.

153
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,736
Inside, you'll find everything you need

154
00:06:38,738 --> 00:06:39,803
to make sense of it all.

155
00:06:39,805 --> 00:06:40,805
Make sense of what?

156
00:06:40,806 --> 00:06:42,806
Something big is happening.

157
00:06:42,808 --> 00:06:44,642
That's not gonna suffice, son.

158
00:06:44,644 --> 00:06:46,076
Come on, what is it they say

159
00:06:46,078 --> 00:06:47,711
about time and being of the essence?!

160
00:06:47,713 --> 00:06:49,046
Take him back to the cell.

161
00:06:49,048 --> 00:06:50,914
Walter.

162
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,983
It's something big, Walter.

163
00:06:57,188 --> 00:07:00,757
Guy says something big's coming,
then clams up.

164
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,960
Why is it you geniuses are
such a pain in the ass?

165
00:07:02,962 --> 00:07:04,094
He's not to me.

166
00:07:04,096 --> 00:07:06,196
He knows I understand his expertise,

167
00:07:06,198 --> 00:07:07,531
the radio frequencies, time codes.

168
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:09,833
But I won't know for sure
exactly what he's going on about

169
00:07:09,835 --> 00:07:11,568
until I see his notes.

170
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,003
So, I'm gonna have to call my team,

171
00:07:13,005 --> 00:07:14,638
get them to meet us at Mark's house.

172
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,574
Gentlemen, we have zero interest
in opening the circle on this.

173
00:07:17,576 --> 00:07:20,277
I will ensure their discretion, sir.

174
00:07:24,182 --> 00:07:25,582
What was that about earlier,

175
00:07:25,584 --> 00:07:27,651
about you keeping your head on solid ground?

176
00:07:27,653 --> 00:07:29,419
Mark's always had the wrong idea about me,

177
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:31,388
it's best to leave it at that.

178
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:36,193
Also, best not to tell the team
whose house we're going to.

179
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:52,042
Guys, this way.

180
00:07:52,044 --> 00:07:53,677
You know how much we love
 a good mystery, Walter.

181
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:54,711
What exactly are we doing here?

182
00:07:54,713 --> 00:07:55,845
Working.

183
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:05,388
Whoa, I bet this picks up
the country station nice and clear.

184
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,590
That is quite a fence.

185
00:08:07,592 --> 00:08:09,058
Half-inch diameter rebar,

186
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,427
reinforced steel chain-link mesh.

187
00:08:11,429 --> 00:08:12,729
Pure paranoia.

188
00:08:12,731 --> 00:08:14,697
When I rotated through
Bellevue psychiatric,

189
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,933
I treated a patient who
wore a diaper on his head

190
00:08:16,935 --> 00:08:18,301
and called himself “King Poo Poo.”

191
00:08:18,303 --> 00:08:20,169
This is crazier.

192
00:08:21,205 --> 00:08:23,272
There can't be more than
a few people in California

193
00:08:23,274 --> 00:08:24,907
with this much listening equipment.

194
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:26,009
Whose house is this, Walter?

195
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:27,076
Keep an open mind.

196
00:08:27,078 --> 00:08:28,277
Mark Collins?!

197
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,779
Are you insane?

198
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:30,780
No, but Collins is.

199
00:08:30,782 --> 00:08:31,948
Someone want to explain?

200
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,183
He was a member of the team,
it didn't work out.

201
00:08:34,185 --> 00:08:37,286
With Collins, “Didn't work
out” is an understatement.

202
00:08:37,288 --> 00:08:38,421
You lured us here.

203
00:08:38,423 --> 00:08:39,655
Would you have come if you knew?

204
00:08:39,657 --> 00:08:40,590
No.

205
00:08:40,592 --> 00:08:41,657
Help us find the recordings

206
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,593
we're looking for. All we need is data.

207
00:08:43,595 --> 00:08:44,594
Where's Collins?

208
00:08:44,596 --> 00:08:46,329
He was arrested.

209
00:08:46,331 --> 00:08:47,863
Of course he is.

210
00:08:47,865 --> 00:08:50,066
All right, let's get a move on, come on.

211
00:08:50,068 --> 00:08:52,568
My God, was he always like this?

212
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,670
Looks like he had
a lonely few years.

213
00:08:54,672 --> 00:08:56,539
Oh, tough for him.

214
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,075
What's the story with this Collins?

215
00:08:59,077 --> 00:09:01,711
Well, if you didn't agree with him,

216
00:09:01,713 --> 00:09:04,580
he'd argue with you until you did,

217
00:09:04,582 --> 00:09:06,115
and he knew his mind games.

218
00:09:06,117 --> 00:09:08,584
The worst of it was how he affected Walter.

219
00:09:08,586 --> 00:09:09,752
He'd get in his head,

220
00:09:09,754 --> 00:09:12,121
erase his good judgment
and forget we existed.

221
00:09:12,123 --> 00:09:13,889
Guys.

222
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:15,424
We're supposed to be working here.

223
00:09:15,426 --> 00:09:17,893
They really don't like this guy.

224
00:09:17,895 --> 00:09:19,962
Maybe you should have told them up front?

225
00:09:21,298 --> 00:09:25,434
Just saying, secrets breed mistrust.

226
00:09:25,436 --> 00:09:27,236
2004, 2005 through 2014.

227
00:09:27,238 --> 00:09:31,407
Playing all the hits from
the obsessive top 40.

228
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:33,075
Got the tape from March 25.

229
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:35,144
Cue up 6:32 a.m.

230
00:09:37,147 --> 00:09:39,114
It's incredible work.

231
00:09:39,116 --> 00:09:42,551
So, this guy was like you
guys, and then... this?

232
00:09:42,553 --> 00:09:43,886
It happens sometimes.

233
00:09:43,888 --> 00:09:45,254
With Mark, it was intense, though.

234
00:09:45,256 --> 00:09:46,788
Like, if you played chess with him,

235
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,323
he'd make you doubt your every move.

236
00:09:48,325 --> 00:09:50,525
And then “Blammo”... checkmate.

237
00:09:50,527 --> 00:09:52,327
Against you?

238
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:54,496
Walter.

239
00:09:54,498 --> 00:09:56,031
Walter.

240
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:58,800
Walter.

241
00:09:58,802 --> 00:09:59,835
Walter!

242
00:09:59,837 --> 00:10:00,969
What?

243
00:10:00,971 --> 00:10:04,039
I said your name four times.

244
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,273
I'm good.

245
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:07,142
Play the tape.

246
00:10:07,144 --> 00:10:09,945
6:32 a.m.

247
00:10:09,947 --> 00:10:11,246
But, sir, I'm almost certain

248
00:10:11,248 --> 00:10:12,748
there will be a major problem

249
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,283
unless we find a way to
run the SCADA update.

250
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,556
Nothing until 6:46.

251
00:10:21,558 --> 00:10:23,325
Channel went dark for 14 minutes.

252
00:10:23,327 --> 00:10:25,260
Who is that on tape?

253
00:10:25,262 --> 00:10:27,996
A scientist at the reactor,
talking over an internal radio.

254
00:10:27,998 --> 00:10:29,431
And “SCADA”?

255
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:32,033
These old reactors run on
ancient 1980s technology.

256
00:10:32,035 --> 00:10:34,669
SCADA is the brain that
controls the rest of the system.

257
00:10:34,671 --> 00:10:36,571
And it needs to be kept up to date.

258
00:10:36,573 --> 00:10:37,906
What are they covering up?

259
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,209
Collins has been down here for years

260
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:43,445
capturing everything he
could about his neighbor,

261
00:10:43,447 --> 00:10:45,513
the Montero Nuclear Power Plant.

262
00:10:45,515 --> 00:10:47,615
Rising ocean temperatures,

263
00:10:47,617 --> 00:10:50,218
radiation levels near the plant.

264
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,986
Right, so the water's getting warmer,

265
00:10:51,988 --> 00:10:53,721
more radioactive, and then someone

266
00:10:53,723 --> 00:10:55,423
at the power plant says there's a problem.

267
00:10:55,425 --> 00:10:56,858
Poof, communications went blank.

268
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,893
Collins is alerting us to a major problem

269
00:10:58,895 --> 00:11:00,662
at the reactor that's
being actively ignored.

270
00:11:00,664 --> 00:11:01,829
Why on earth would someone do that?

271
00:11:01,831 --> 00:11:03,264
Standard bureaucratic cover-your-ass.

272
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:05,867
Shocking to think that would
extend to nuclear materials,

273
00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:07,535
but it does.

274
00:11:07,537 --> 00:11:08,636
Okay, so we pass this on

275
00:11:08,638 --> 00:11:10,738
to the army, and we are done here, right?

276
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,906
No.

277
00:11:11,908 --> 00:11:12,940
Collins wouldn't have called us

278
00:11:12,942 --> 00:11:14,609
unless he thought it needed our expertise.

279
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:16,411
Since when does he call us?

280
00:11:16,413 --> 00:11:18,312
General Walker said he needs our help.

281
00:11:18,314 --> 00:11:20,348
Who knows how dangerous this situation is?

282
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,784
Exactly. Guys, what's happening here?

283
00:11:24,786 --> 00:11:27,989
We just took a job upgrading
an ancient nuclear power plant.

284
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:31,225
End of story.

285
00:11:32,661 --> 00:11:34,128
Want to know what's really happening here?

286
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,563
Mark Collins is back in our lives.

287
00:11:35,565 --> 00:11:38,165
If this nuclear power
plant doesn't melt down,

288
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:39,433
the team might.

289
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:48,334
sync and corrections by <font color="#FF0000">dreaMaker7</font>
www.addic7ed.com

290
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,933
Oh, oh, this is wonderful.

291
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:07,101
The creepiest place on earth.

292
00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:08,369
We'll upgrade the system.

293
00:12:08,371 --> 00:12:09,771
We'll be gone in two hours.

294
00:12:09,773 --> 00:12:13,011
Without speaking to Collins, correct?

295
00:12:13,037 --> 00:12:14,303
General's coming.

296
00:12:14,305 --> 00:12:15,404
General.

297
00:12:15,406 --> 00:12:16,872
All right.

298
00:12:16,874 --> 00:12:18,040
Somebody educate me.

299
00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:20,242
You guys wait here.

300
00:12:23,613 --> 00:12:26,048
Now, Collins intercepted discussions

301
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,950
about the reactor's software and computers.

302
00:12:27,952 --> 00:12:29,184
Now, the ones that regulate

303
00:12:29,186 --> 00:12:30,752
the nuclear core temperatures

304
00:12:30,754 --> 00:12:32,453
were installed in the late 1980s.

305
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:34,289
Walter believes that the software

306
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,962
should've been completely
updated 15 years ago.

307
00:12:35,986 --> 00:12:38,129
Standard bureaucratic
mentality is to go cheap,

308
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:39,554
patches on patches.

309
00:12:39,556 --> 00:12:41,356
This whole system becomes a house of cards.

310
00:12:41,358 --> 00:12:43,425
But I'm looking at a core temperature gauge

311
00:12:43,427 --> 00:12:44,826
- in the green. 
- Yeah, well,

312
00:12:44,828 --> 00:12:47,228
there are shoddy indicators
all around this place.

313
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,897
Mind if I try something?

314
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,165
Thank you.

315
00:12:50,526 --> 00:12:52,393
The plant's got time-worn fail-safes,

316
00:12:52,419 --> 00:12:53,652
but we're supposed to believe

317
00:12:53,654 --> 00:12:55,120
some rambling lunatic

318
00:12:55,122 --> 00:12:56,254
we found in a field?

319
00:12:56,256 --> 00:12:59,824
Well, a brilliant mind with a likely 190 IQ.

320
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,261
General, you had a loose fuse.

321
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:10,057
Oh, no.

322
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:11,159
Why don't you play the tape?

323
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:13,394
General, let me show you something.

324
00:13:17,165 --> 00:13:19,367
The problem is, it stopped regulating

325
00:13:19,369 --> 00:13:21,702
and a SCADA update is risky as hell.

326
00:13:21,704 --> 00:13:23,137
God help us if it fails.

327
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:24,238
That's Dr. Fitzsimmons,

328
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,773
lead safety officer of the plant.

329
00:13:25,775 --> 00:13:28,409
Yeah, on a cell call to his wife
saying that the reactor software

330
00:13:28,411 --> 00:13:30,344
is failing to regulate the
nuclear core temperatures,

331
00:13:30,346 --> 00:13:31,812
and he's too scared to say anything.

332
00:13:31,814 --> 00:13:34,181
Now, he's the one that runs
your safety checks, correct?

333
00:13:34,183 --> 00:13:36,450
And he just moved to
Pennsylvania six weeks ago.

334
00:13:36,452 --> 00:13:38,085
His replacement hasn't been hired.

335
00:13:38,087 --> 00:13:39,353
The only regular traffic here

336
00:13:39,355 --> 00:13:41,455
are the MPs guarding the perimeter.

337
00:13:41,457 --> 00:13:43,224
The reactor's inoperative.

338
00:13:43,226 --> 00:13:45,259
It's in cool-down mode
for the next eight years

339
00:13:45,261 --> 00:13:46,493
until it can be dismantled.

340
00:13:46,495 --> 00:13:48,596
Except it's not being properly regulated.

341
00:13:48,598 --> 00:13:51,232
So it's not cooling down, it's overheating.

342
00:13:51,234 --> 00:13:53,834
Now, the system needs SCADA updates.

343
00:13:53,836 --> 00:13:56,670
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition.

344
00:13:56,672 --> 00:13:58,706
You know, I confess to a basic knowledge

345
00:13:58,708 --> 00:13:59,940
of the technology here,

346
00:13:59,942 --> 00:14:01,442
so if we're facing the next Fukishima,

347
00:14:01,444 --> 00:14:02,788
tell me that.

348
00:14:02,814 --> 00:14:05,021
General, I can fix this,

349
00:14:05,047 --> 00:14:07,948
- and as soon as Collins gets here, we begin.
- Collins?

350
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,451
So the guy in the tin foil hat
is gonna walk us out of this?

351
00:14:10,453 --> 00:14:11,485
Look.

352
00:14:11,487 --> 00:14:13,850
From listening to chatter,

353
00:14:13,876 --> 00:14:15,589
Collins diagramed this exactly.

354
00:14:15,591 --> 00:14:18,458
Patches on patches.

355
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,893
Now, if we try to upgrade

356
00:14:19,895 --> 00:14:21,795
using the wrong building blocks,

357
00:14:21,797 --> 00:14:23,096
it could fry the whole system.

358
00:14:23,098 --> 00:14:24,164
Collins' knowledge

359
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,532
of this mess

360
00:14:25,534 --> 00:14:26,700
could help prevent that,

361
00:14:26,702 --> 00:14:28,168
and given the core temperature,

362
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,637
I'd say we have 18 hours
before it starts to overheat.

363
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,572
Don't even say the word “meltdown.”

364
00:14:32,574 --> 00:14:35,942
Keep him in handcuffs with a
gun at his back for all I care.

365
00:14:35,944 --> 00:14:37,477
We need him.

366
00:14:39,113 --> 00:14:40,347
A little more on Collins?

367
00:14:40,349 --> 00:14:41,615
He's what my teachers used to call me,

368
00:14:41,617 --> 00:14:43,049
- “A bad influence.” 
- He and Walter

369
00:14:43,051 --> 00:14:45,118
would push each other and
just get lost in the work.

370
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,920
Theoretical algorithms for days.

371
00:14:46,922 --> 00:14:49,189
No breaks, no food, no sleep.
They'd barely speak.

372
00:14:49,191 --> 00:14:50,824
Sometimes we'd lose Walter for weeks.

373
00:14:50,826 --> 00:14:52,792
It's called a savant dissociative state.

374
00:14:52,794 --> 00:14:54,794
- Not pretty. 
- Then what?

375
00:14:54,796 --> 00:14:56,296
Mark just disappeared.

376
00:14:56,298 --> 00:14:57,497
Thin air.

377
00:14:57,499 --> 00:14:58,698
Walter was pretty affected.

378
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,767
Simply put, Mark is disruptive.

379
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:01,801
So, project manager,

380
00:15:01,803 --> 00:15:04,037
does today strike you as a good day

381
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,705
for disruptive?

382
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,811
You going to talk to our man?

383
00:15:11,813 --> 00:15:13,113
Yes.

384
00:15:13,115 --> 00:15:16,182
Good. I may not know that
much about geniuses,

385
00:15:16,184 --> 00:15:18,551
but I do know when
someone's keeping a secret.

386
00:15:18,553 --> 00:15:20,753
Okay.

387
00:15:22,823 --> 00:15:25,558
You're making a lot of unilateral decisions

388
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,327
to include a guy no one else wants.

389
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:28,695
They'll have to deal with it.

390
00:15:28,697 --> 00:15:29,929
I'm trying to keep this facility

391
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:31,764
and four million people from getting cooked.

392
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:33,333
You obviously have a very
different relationship

393
00:15:33,335 --> 00:15:34,667
with Collins than the others,

394
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:36,703
and you miss it since he left?

395
00:15:36,705 --> 00:15:38,538
Yes, exactly.

396
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,440
Or is it that he's now
alone living in squalor,

397
00:15:40,442 --> 00:15:41,541
and you feel bad for him?

398
00:15:41,543 --> 00:15:42,742
You know I don't think emotionally.

399
00:15:42,744 --> 00:15:44,010
That's your job, okay?

400
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:46,213
Which you're certainly
not making it easy to do.

401
00:15:46,214 --> 00:15:48,047
A little insight

402
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:49,949
would help everyone.

403
00:15:53,288 --> 00:15:55,955
Wise choice,

404
00:15:55,957 --> 00:15:57,523
my friend.

405
00:15:57,525 --> 00:15:58,891
Come on, let's get to work.

406
00:15:58,893 --> 00:16:00,694
The gang's all here.

407
00:16:00,695 --> 00:16:01,761
I love it!

408
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:04,196
Sylvester, my brother! Come on.

409
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:06,532
Well, come on!

410
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:09,869
Now, this is a two-pronged attack.

411
00:16:09,871 --> 00:16:11,470
There's two computers
that need our attention.

412
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:13,072
First there's this one.

413
00:16:13,074 --> 00:16:14,240
It runs the reactor.

414
00:16:14,242 --> 00:16:16,342
Exactly whom are we taking orders from?

415
00:16:16,344 --> 00:16:17,910
Both of us.

416
00:16:17,912 --> 00:16:20,613
We need to download the
reactor calibrations from here.

417
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:22,248
For the civilians?

418
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,816
Reactor calibrations tell the computer

419
00:16:23,818 --> 00:16:25,084
if hot is too hot,

420
00:16:25,086 --> 00:16:27,453
so it knows what's an
alarm and what's normal.

421
00:16:27,455 --> 00:16:29,421
Can't update the system without
getting that information

422
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:30,689
here first.

423
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:32,424
Did you get smarter, Sylvester?

424
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:34,393
I think I've always been this smart.

425
00:16:34,395 --> 00:16:35,394
Right.

426
00:16:35,396 --> 00:16:36,895
Second thing we need to do

427
00:16:36,897 --> 00:16:38,998
is to prep the system for the SCADA update.

428
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,266
Otherwise,
it would be like putting a new V12

429
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:43,369
in an old Model T.

430
00:16:43,371 --> 00:16:44,503
Happy,

431
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:46,005
you and Toby can handle that.

432
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:48,140
I do not like him handing out assignments.

433
00:16:48,142 --> 00:16:49,508
It's efficient, Happy.

434
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,311
We're here to do a job.

435
00:16:52,313 --> 00:16:53,779
Now, the main computer, that's near here?

436
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:55,147
We're at the reactor.

437
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:56,882
The mainframe is

438
00:16:56,884 --> 00:16:57,983
in this building here.

439
00:16:57,985 --> 00:17:00,819
About a quarter mile across the campus, Max.

440
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:02,221
All right.

441
00:17:02,223 --> 00:17:03,355
Come on.

442
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:05,190
Get a move on, people.

443
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,826
We have a job to do.

444
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:14,032
Remember what I said.

445
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:19,771
Oh, my God.

446
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:22,333
This technology predates my birth.

447
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,711
Well, hello. We come to you

448
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:27,779
from the distant past.

449
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,683
Are we seriously

450
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:33,819
supposed to stop a nuclear meltdown

451
00:17:33,821 --> 00:17:34,820
with this junk?

452
00:17:34,822 --> 00:17:36,821
You are and you will.

453
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,724
He really tests my nerves.

454
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:42,060
Prepare the SCADA system upgrade.

455
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,895
We'll be there in ten minutes.

456
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:48,500
- Hey.
- Mm-hmm?

457
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:50,235
Thanks for letting me help with this.

458
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,604
It was efficient.

459
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,340
Some things never change.

460
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:58,109
Except now you're getting paid.

461
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:00,712
Team's coming together.

462
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:03,014
You got a girl.

463
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:05,083
You've been spending too
much time in your basement.

464
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,818
You could've called

465
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,954
the cops or the military,
but you-you chose us.

466
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:11,523
Why?

467
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:14,525
Do you ever think about
any of our old projects?

468
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,561
We were making a lot of progress

469
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:18,896
on our super symmetry theory.

470
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:22,166
Maybe when we wrap up here,
you could show me the new data?

471
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,837
Maybe you owe me one?

472
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,238
You do understand

473
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,942
I wasn't pleased with the
way that things turned out.

474
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:33,444
Was that “EQ” Walter?

475
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,146
Maybe you could reminisce later?

476
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:37,048
Focus on the work right now.

477
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,883
Boss man's right.

478
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,119
Okay, uh, for this section of code,

479
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,387
you're gonna need RPL and PARADOX.

480
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:45,089
This OS isn't corrupt?

481
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:47,058
It's like they have their own language.

482
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,527
Imagine that kind of intensity
for three weeks straight.

483
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:51,095
And he just disappeared, no trace?

484
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,431
Walter wouldn't discuss it.

485
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:54,865
Okay.

486
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,901
We're good to download
the reactor calibrations.

487
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:59,036
Sylvester, you're on.

488
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:00,037
Wait.

489
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,906
We have not run a full diagnostic.

490
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:03,307
If we don't stress-test

491
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,675
the system circuitry,

492
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:06,744
it could be us melting this place down.

493
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:07,978
What's she talking about?

494
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,347
When we upgrade,
it will pump a lot of electricity

495
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,615
through this junk pile.

496
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,050
If this system has flaws...

497
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:15,219
old wiring, rat-chewed insulation...

498
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:18,088
we want to know now and
where so we can fortify.

499
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,024
No, that's a waste of time.

500
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:22,106
We're not rebuilding a motorcycle engine.

501
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,129
Look, that test alone 
could overload the system.

502
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:26,830
Walter, I know what I'm talking about.

503
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,365
Not more than I do.

504
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,634
Would someone make the call here?

505
00:19:32,003 --> 00:19:34,738
Happy, we've only got one shot.

506
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,441
If your diagnostic crashes the system,

507
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,676
then we have a meltdown in 17½ hours,

508
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,612
and we might not have enough time

509
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:43,280
to rebuild the system from scratch.

510
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,515
If Collins runs the download

511
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,916
before the system's ready for it,

512
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,451
we have a meltdown now.

513
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:49,019
Happy's never liked me.

514
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,687
Her opposition is personal.

515
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,422
It's not based on knowledge.

516
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:55,993
Knowledge that I have of this
reactor that she doesn't.

517
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:57,761
Trust me.

518
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,596
I have complete confidence in this.

519
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,498
Well, you'd better be right, son.

520
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,967
Because there's no do-over.

521
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,435
Don't do it, Walter.

522
00:20:19,784 --> 00:20:21,218
Okay.

523
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,688
We are downloading the reactor calibrations.

524
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,923
Four-minute ETA.

525
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,725
Walt, a minute outside.

526
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,293
Yeah.

527
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,329
You might have just bought
yourself some good will

528
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,830
for that trespassing charge.

529
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,399
I'm just glad to be of service, General.

530
00:20:44,842 --> 00:20:46,476
Don't ever take

531
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,778
someone else's side over
me in public again, Walter,

532
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,848
or I will disappear on you
faster than Collins did.

533
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,149
You're taking this personal.

534
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:54,217
It was business.

535
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:55,785
I was trying to avoid a meltdown.

536
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:59,222
I already stopped a meltdown... yours.

537
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:03,860
Ten-day bender with Collins,
and who pulled you out of it?

538
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:06,462
You were damn near starved,
muttering to yourself.

539
00:21:06,464 --> 00:21:08,264
I practically had to force-feed you.

540
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:09,866
I remember.

541
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:12,902
When he bailed,
it was the best thing for us.

542
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,772
And him being back is the worst.

543
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,774
And if he stays,

544
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,209
and you take another trip
down the rabbit hole with him,

545
00:21:20,211 --> 00:21:22,645
you are on your own.

546
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:24,580
I am not going through that again.

547
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:26,849
Happy...

548
00:21:26,851 --> 00:21:28,217
Happy!

549
00:21:36,093 --> 00:21:37,093
What is this?

550
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:38,427
I know you're upset.

551
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:40,930
The note expresses a few things
that might make you smile.

552
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,732
Are you kidding?
I'm going toe-to-toe with Walter

553
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,367
and you hand me a mash note?

554
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,469
When you feel the time is right, read it,

555
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,504
and you will understand
why I gave it to you.

556
00:21:48,506 --> 00:21:50,239
Pretend I know a little
about the human psyche.

557
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:52,475
“Rebuilding a motorcycle engine.”

558
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,176
Collins always loved digging that knife in.

559
00:21:54,178 --> 00:21:56,879
You love rebuilding motorcycle engines.

560
00:21:56,881 --> 00:21:58,914
It's hardly the breadth of my ability.

561
00:22:01,451 --> 00:22:04,253
Screw him. This computer could
still use a circuit test.

562
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:06,488
We can at least do half this job safely.

563
00:22:09,926 --> 00:22:11,560
Sylvester?

564
00:22:11,562 --> 00:22:13,595
Almost done downloading the
old reactor configuration.

565
00:22:13,597 --> 00:22:15,264
Okay.

566
00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:18,801
The others were always very sharp, Walter,

567
00:22:18,803 --> 00:22:22,071
but they were never us.

568
00:22:30,147 --> 00:22:31,747
Oh, no.

569
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,284
Happy, what do you see?

570
00:22:35,286 --> 00:22:37,653
The backup generator in
chamber one blew out.

571
00:22:37,655 --> 00:22:40,722
Walter, I think it's my fault.

572
00:22:40,724 --> 00:22:43,125
It happened right after
I-I ran the system check.

573
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:44,593
Happy, I told you not to!

574
00:22:44,595 --> 00:22:45,627
We evacuate now,

575
00:22:45,629 --> 00:22:47,396
before all the containment doors close.

576
00:22:47,398 --> 00:22:48,430
Containment?

577
00:22:48,432 --> 00:22:50,165
Why am I thinking this isn't a drill?

578
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:51,266
No, this is what you get

579
00:22:51,268 --> 00:22:52,701
when an aging system is held together

580
00:22:52,703 --> 00:22:55,137
with duct tape and a Hail Mary for 30 years.

581
00:22:57,374 --> 00:22:59,174
Cooling system! Radiation leak!

582
00:23:00,209 --> 00:23:01,476
Get out of here now!

583
00:23:03,747 --> 00:23:06,181
O'Brien, get your ass in gear!

584
00:23:06,183 --> 00:23:07,215
No, we're still downloading.

585
00:23:07,217 --> 00:23:08,350
If I leave now, we're all dead.

586
00:23:08,352 --> 00:23:10,151
I can still fix this.

587
00:23:11,153 --> 00:23:12,687
Give me an ETA.

588
00:23:14,658 --> 00:23:15,890
Got the reactor configuration.

589
00:23:15,892 --> 00:23:18,693
We can upgrade the system
in the computer room.

590
00:23:18,695 --> 00:23:20,295
If we get out alive.

591
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:26,968
The containment doors are closing!

592
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,170
Should we tell them that if
the core temp keeps rising

593
00:23:29,172 --> 00:23:31,906
at this rate, we're less than
60 minutes from full meltdown?

594
00:23:31,908 --> 00:23:34,676
Maybe hold that off until they're out.

595
00:23:38,714 --> 00:23:39,547
Hurry!

596
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:41,182
Come on, Cabe, come on!

597
00:23:41,884 --> 00:23:43,084
Go, go, go!

598
00:23:43,086 --> 00:23:44,152
Get to the door, get to the door!

599
00:23:44,154 --> 00:23:45,386
Walter!

600
00:23:45,388 --> 00:23:47,255
Paige, get to the door! Walter!

601
00:23:50,493 --> 00:23:53,394
There's got to be a way
to get them out of here.

602
00:23:53,396 --> 00:23:55,196
Guys, there's a door

603
00:23:55,198 --> 00:23:57,832
at the end of the walkway
over the cooling room.

604
00:23:57,834 --> 00:24:00,935
It must be defective
'cause it's closing slower than the others.

605
00:24:00,937 --> 00:24:02,403
But you'd better move your asses.

606
00:24:14,349 --> 00:24:16,050
Over there, the door!

607
00:24:18,888 --> 00:24:19,920
Cabe!

608
00:24:20,522 --> 00:24:21,455
Cabe!

609
00:24:21,457 --> 00:24:22,790
Hurry.

610
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:24,892
Cabe! Cabe! It's not gonna hold!

611
00:24:24,894 --> 00:24:26,093
Go now!

612
00:24:26,095 --> 00:24:27,628
Cabe, it's not gonna...

613
00:24:28,497 --> 00:24:29,797
Go! Go!

614
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,768
There's got to be an
override here somewhere.

615
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:37,138
Ah, damn it!

616
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,105
Calculate fast, Walter!

617
00:24:38,107 --> 00:24:39,907
How much time to get me out of here?

618
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:42,543
You hold on tight.
I'm gonna figure this out.

619
00:24:54,622 --> 00:24:55,922
What's going on?

620
00:24:55,924 --> 00:24:57,624
Walter's safe. Cabe's trapped in there.

621
00:24:59,328 --> 00:25:00,560
Thanks to you.

622
00:25:00,562 --> 00:25:02,028
Hey, how about you settle down?

623
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,663
Oh, that's cute.

624
00:25:03,665 --> 00:25:07,667
The tell-it-like-it-is shrink
making up for his pal's mistake.

625
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:10,403
All right, I got it...
layout of the entire power plant.

626
00:25:10,405 --> 00:25:11,993
There's got to be an escape route

627
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:13,965
for Cabe in here somewhere.

628
00:25:14,232 --> 00:25:15,809
No. No!

629
00:25:15,811 --> 00:25:18,545
The monitor won't let me see the full size.

630
00:25:18,547 --> 00:25:20,788
- Print it. 
- Okay, good idea.

631
00:25:24,685 --> 00:25:27,587
Are you kidding me?

632
00:25:27,589 --> 00:25:29,689
Come on, you slow bastard!

633
00:25:31,493 --> 00:25:33,726
Okay, I'm sorry I yelled.

634
00:25:33,728 --> 00:25:36,462
Guys, where are we?

635
00:25:36,464 --> 00:25:38,531
The reactor blueprints won't print,
the monitor's frozen.

636
00:25:38,533 --> 00:25:40,133
This is bad.

637
00:25:44,404 --> 00:25:46,239
It just got worse.

638
00:25:46,241 --> 00:25:48,040
That's radioactive steam escaping.

639
00:25:48,042 --> 00:25:49,709
Walter?

640
00:25:49,711 --> 00:25:51,021
Cabe?

641
00:25:51,047 --> 00:25:52,880
A pipe just broke.

642
00:25:52,906 --> 00:25:55,507
I need to know if that steam's contaminated.

643
00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:56,699
The structural integrity

644
00:25:56,719 --> 00:25:58,652
of the building you're
in may be compromised.

645
00:25:58,654 --> 00:25:59,953
Answer the question.

646
00:25:59,955 --> 00:26:01,855
It's a large room;
if you're out in ten minutes,

647
00:26:01,857 --> 00:26:03,623
it won't be worse than a couple of X rays.

648
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:06,460
What's the likelihood I'm gonna
get out of here in ten minutes?

649
00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:09,563
He knows the greater good would be to

650
00:26:09,565 --> 00:26:12,099
forget about him and concentrate
on stopping the meltdown.

651
00:26:12,101 --> 00:26:13,300
We can't let him die.

652
00:26:13,302 --> 00:26:14,701
You're actually worried about a man's life?

653
00:26:14,703 --> 00:26:17,037
That's not the Walter O'Brien I remember.

654
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,072
You can help him. Doesn't need all of us

655
00:26:19,074 --> 00:26:20,207
to upgrade the system.

656
00:26:20,209 --> 00:26:22,242
We could solve two problems at once.

657
00:26:22,244 --> 00:26:25,545
The effluent pipe.

658
00:26:25,547 --> 00:26:27,347
Pumps water out of the
reactor and into the ocean.

659
00:26:27,349 --> 00:26:31,851
He could get in it and ride it
out away from the power plant.

660
00:26:31,853 --> 00:26:32,919
Which one is it?

661
00:26:32,921 --> 00:26:34,921
I don't remember off the top of my head.

662
00:26:34,923 --> 00:26:38,358
I recorded radio chatter about
it last cooling system check.

663
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,427
June of '04. It's back at my house.

664
00:26:40,429 --> 00:26:41,428
It's five minutes away.

665
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,430
Take him.

666
00:26:43,432 --> 00:26:45,331
Under guard.

667
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:47,434
Happy, go with him,

668
00:26:47,436 --> 00:26:48,601
translate the schematics.

669
00:26:50,504 --> 00:26:52,272
Hey, Collins,

670
00:26:52,274 --> 00:26:54,834
you lay off her, or we have an issue.

671
00:26:56,777 --> 00:26:59,379
Happy and Collins might not
play nice together. Can you...

672
00:26:59,381 --> 00:27:00,446
I'll go with them.

673
00:27:00,448 --> 00:27:01,581
Walter, do I want to hear

674
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:04,117
the stats on how this might turn out?

675
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,151
Cabe.

676
00:27:05,153 --> 00:27:06,753
Walter?

677
00:27:06,755 --> 00:27:11,157
I'd say, best guess,
you have a one-in-three chance.

678
00:27:12,226 --> 00:27:14,761
Walter, if my life is in the hands

679
00:27:14,763 --> 00:27:16,529
of this Collins guy,

680
00:27:16,531 --> 00:27:19,966
I need to know if you're hiding something.

681
00:27:23,003 --> 00:27:26,172
Three years ago,
I had him committed to an asylum.

682
00:27:26,174 --> 00:27:28,875
Fantastic.

683
00:27:35,016 --> 00:27:37,717
June 2004.

684
00:27:48,261 --> 00:27:50,963
Three minutes until Cabe
gets radiation poisoning.

685
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:54,366
Listen to this.

686
00:27:54,368 --> 00:27:59,205
Effluent channel,
outbound to ocean, Pipe 6, Chamber 19-A.

687
00:27:59,207 --> 00:28:00,973
Walter,

688
00:28:00,975 --> 00:28:02,808
Pipe 6, Chamber 19-A.

689
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:03,943
How certain are we?

690
00:28:03,945 --> 00:28:05,144
Totally certain.

691
00:28:05,146 --> 00:28:07,046
Unless they changed it
in the last ten years,

692
00:28:07,048 --> 00:28:08,747
which is possible.

693
00:28:08,749 --> 00:28:10,416
Cabe, we found the one pipe

694
00:28:10,418 --> 00:28:12,084
that's gonna get you out to safety.

695
00:28:12,086 --> 00:28:13,552
What'll the other pipes do?

696
00:28:13,554 --> 00:28:15,354
Don't think about that right now.

697
00:28:15,356 --> 00:28:18,023
Okay. But for the record,
if you're wrong and I get killed,

698
00:28:18,025 --> 00:28:20,059
I'm gonna be very pissed off.

699
00:28:20,061 --> 00:28:22,694
Yeah, I'll be pissed off if
you don't start running now.

700
00:28:22,696 --> 00:28:26,598
Cabe, Chamber 19-A is down
the hall ahead of you.

701
00:28:29,536 --> 00:28:31,336
And the pipes have access hatches.

702
00:28:31,338 --> 00:28:34,540
You drop in it,
it should carry you out to safety

703
00:28:34,542 --> 00:28:37,976
about a hundred yards from shore.

704
00:28:37,978 --> 00:28:39,611
Okay, I'm ready.

705
00:28:40,128 --> 00:28:44,398
Hey, listen, kid,
if this doesn't work out...

706
00:28:45,252 --> 00:28:47,252
I'm glad I got to know you.

707
00:28:47,254 --> 00:28:49,421
Okay.

708
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,558
A man gives you what could
be his last good-bye,

709
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,327
and you say “Okay”?

710
00:28:55,329 --> 00:28:57,889
You could use some time on the couch.

711
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,268
I may be seeing you soon, sweetheart.

712
00:29:10,977 --> 00:29:12,077
He's in.

713
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:17,749
Gonna say a little prayer for him right now.

714
00:29:17,751 --> 00:29:19,451
I don't really believe in death.

715
00:29:19,453 --> 00:29:22,020
energy can't be created or destroyed;

716
00:29:22,022 --> 00:29:23,388
it just changes shape.

717
00:29:24,623 --> 00:29:27,625
But still.

718
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,973
Ladies.

719
00:29:41,975 --> 00:29:43,308
Mister, are you okay?

720
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,109
Never better.

721
00:29:58,557 --> 00:29:59,657
Give me an update.

722
00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:01,591
Less than 30 minutes to stop the meltdown.

723
00:30:01,617 --> 00:30:03,216
Now, step one was the reactor calibrations,

724
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,551
which we downloaded.

725
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,853
This is step two...
we're programming SCADA update.

726
00:30:06,855 --> 00:30:09,022
When we're finished,
we can send it to the reactor remotely.

727
00:30:09,024 --> 00:30:10,791
The moment this update hits the reactor,

728
00:30:10,793 --> 00:30:13,126
it's programmed to drop all
of the core temperatures

729
00:30:13,128 --> 00:30:14,227
to a normal level.

730
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,529
Which means the meltdown is

731
00:30:15,531 --> 00:30:17,564
100% no longer a threat, correct?

732
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,486
Correct. And then I get hammered.

733
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,469
What if this doesn't work?

734
00:30:22,471 --> 00:30:24,104
You got roughly 45 minutes.

735
00:30:24,106 --> 00:30:25,605
Take your car, get Ralph,

736
00:30:25,607 --> 00:30:28,175
drive like hell past the
Santa Monica mountains.

737
00:30:28,177 --> 00:30:29,976
Radiation cloud should pool up

738
00:30:29,978 --> 00:30:31,545
in the San Fernando Valley basin.

739
00:30:31,547 --> 00:30:33,146
You might be okay.

740
00:30:33,148 --> 00:30:35,749
No one would blame you if
you wanted a head start.

741
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,784
If it doesn't work, I'll go get Ralph.

742
00:30:39,153 --> 00:30:40,787
But it will.

743
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:42,122
I believe in us.

744
00:30:42,124 --> 00:30:46,026
Yeah, well, us is all I've got.

745
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:02,842
Tell me it's done.

746
00:31:02,844 --> 00:31:05,044
The reactor's safe?

747
00:31:05,046 --> 00:31:07,287
Yeah, I can talk you through the reboot.
Hold on.

748
00:31:08,882 --> 00:31:12,752
Numbers are my photo albums.

749
00:31:12,754 --> 00:31:15,221
Days elapsed since significant occurrences.

750
00:31:15,223 --> 00:31:16,756
I change them every morning.

751
00:31:16,758 --> 00:31:19,826
That's my birthday.

752
00:31:19,828 --> 00:31:21,327
My mother's birthday.

753
00:31:21,329 --> 00:31:23,229
So, I'm still trying to piece out

754
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:24,397
your role here.

755
00:31:25,766 --> 00:31:28,000
No offense, but you're clearly not a genius.

756
00:31:28,002 --> 00:31:29,268
No.

757
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,504
But my son is enabled, like you.

758
00:31:31,506 --> 00:31:32,505
Oh.

759
00:31:32,507 --> 00:31:34,407
Walter's trying to repair his youth

760
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:35,408
through your son.

761
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,476
No, he cares about Ralph,

762
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,911
and Ralph is crazy about Walter.

763
00:31:38,913 --> 00:31:41,147
Of course he is.

764
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,982
Walter's the Pied Piper of geniuses.

765
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,750
We all worship him.

766
00:31:44,752 --> 00:31:46,485
What he's capable of, how he makes us

767
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:49,555
feel special for being special.

768
00:31:49,557 --> 00:31:51,590
That's why it hurts so much

769
00:31:51,592 --> 00:31:53,459
when he throws you away
when he's done with you.

770
00:31:53,461 --> 00:31:54,994
Walter would never do something like that.

771
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,630
I was his experiment, once.

772
00:31:57,632 --> 00:31:59,098
The highest IQ

773
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,367
that he'd ever seen, other than his own.

774
00:32:03,336 --> 00:32:05,171
Until I couldn't color in the lines

775
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,672
the way that he wanted me to,

776
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:07,706
and then I was gone.

777
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:10,075
How many times

778
00:32:10,077 --> 00:32:12,678
has he avoided conflict

779
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,114
by telling you he's fine?

780
00:32:15,116 --> 00:32:17,583
You get about 1,000 “I'm fines”

781
00:32:17,585 --> 00:32:20,419
before you realize that nothing is fine

782
00:32:20,421 --> 00:32:22,287
and you are getting shown the door.

783
00:32:22,289 --> 00:32:24,456
And then you realize

784
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:26,458
that you're an experiment, too.

785
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,894
You...

786
00:32:28,896 --> 00:32:31,063
and your son.

787
00:32:32,265 --> 00:32:33,432
Update's complete.

788
00:32:33,434 --> 00:32:34,733
Now we just need to compress the file,

789
00:32:34,735 --> 00:32:36,201
send it from here to the reactor computer

790
00:32:36,203 --> 00:32:37,403
and no more nuclear meltdown.

791
00:32:37,404 --> 00:32:38,704
Sylvester, can you start the compression?

792
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:39,972
I can do that, yeah.

793
00:32:42,342 --> 00:32:44,109
This is like<i> War Games.</i>

794
00:32:44,111 --> 00:32:45,577
When Matthew Broderick
avoided nuclear calamity

795
00:32:45,579 --> 00:32:46,645
with minutes to spare?

796
00:32:46,647 --> 00:32:49,414
That film had a grouchy general, too.

797
00:32:50,984 --> 00:32:53,618
Not a movie guy, huh?

798
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,221
Good work.

799
00:32:56,223 --> 00:32:58,757
Usually saving millions of
lives gets a bigger response.

800
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:00,592
Just thinking.

801
00:33:00,594 --> 00:33:03,154
Yeah, well, you're always thinking.

802
00:33:03,629 --> 00:33:05,163
You're worried about Collins.

803
00:33:05,165 --> 00:33:08,533
I'll make sure the authorities
know that he was cooperative.

804
00:33:08,535 --> 00:33:09,634
No...

805
00:33:09,636 --> 00:33:10,836
That's not it.

806
00:33:11,704 --> 00:33:13,505
When I had him committed,

807
00:33:13,507 --> 00:33:15,574
I did it because he needed help,

808
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,409
and for the team.

809
00:33:17,411 --> 00:33:20,011
But there's a part of me that knows...

810
00:33:20,013 --> 00:33:22,280
- that I did it for myself. 
- How's that?

811
00:33:22,282 --> 00:33:24,215
When he and I would get into that state,

812
00:33:24,217 --> 00:33:26,685
where nothing exists but thought...

813
00:33:26,687 --> 00:33:28,253
it can be a wonderful place,

814
00:33:28,255 --> 00:33:30,455
but it can be terrifying.

815
00:33:30,457 --> 00:33:32,791
Because you don't know if
you can come out of it.

816
00:33:32,793 --> 00:33:35,560
Part of me knows that
I had Collins committed

817
00:33:35,562 --> 00:33:39,197
to see if other people could
pull him from that place...

818
00:33:39,199 --> 00:33:40,965
in case I ever got to the point

819
00:33:40,967 --> 00:33:43,601
where I couldn't be pulled out on my own.

820
00:33:43,603 --> 00:33:45,270
Bull.

821
00:33:45,272 --> 00:33:47,238
You did the right thing.

822
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,573
This Collins fella?

823
00:33:48,575 --> 00:33:49,941
He's got you questioning yourself,

824
00:33:49,943 --> 00:33:51,309
making you think you did the wrong thing,

825
00:33:51,311 --> 00:33:52,510
but you didn't.

826
00:33:52,512 --> 00:33:54,746
He does have a long history of that.

827
00:33:58,517 --> 00:33:59,684
Oh, no.

828
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,720
What's going on?

829
00:34:04,857 --> 00:34:08,359
This override was just switched
to manual 20 minutes ago.

830
00:34:08,361 --> 00:34:09,794
He knew Happy would run the diagnostics,

831
00:34:09,796 --> 00:34:11,929
he made her think that
she did something wrong

832
00:34:11,931 --> 00:34:13,164
when she didn't...

833
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:14,966
Just like he does in chess.

834
00:34:14,968 --> 00:34:16,200
Makes you doubt your every move.

835
00:34:16,202 --> 00:34:17,735
He wanted to show up the team.

836
00:34:17,737 --> 00:34:19,170
Yeah, to prove his worth.

837
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:22,139
Mark... no.

838
00:34:22,141 --> 00:34:23,274
What the hell's he done now?

839
00:34:23,276 --> 00:34:25,343
There's a piece of gear called an RF DAC.

840
00:34:25,345 --> 00:34:27,812
It converts digital signals into analog

841
00:34:27,814 --> 00:34:30,147
and we need it to send the
update from this computer

842
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:31,382
to the control room.

843
00:34:31,384 --> 00:34:32,583
Collins set this all up.

844
00:34:32,585 --> 00:34:33,984
It's how Collins structured it.

845
00:34:33,986 --> 00:34:35,419
He planted a Trojan horse

846
00:34:35,421 --> 00:34:38,089
he knew would be triggered
once Happy ran the system test.

847
00:34:38,091 --> 00:34:40,257
General, I'm sorry to say
 there's a third step.

848
00:34:40,259 --> 00:34:41,692
We need analog antennas.

849
00:34:41,694 --> 00:34:42,793
We've got them at the base.

850
00:34:42,795 --> 00:34:44,195
But that's a half an hour away.

851
00:34:44,197 --> 00:34:45,863
We need to get to Mark's house.

852
00:34:45,865 --> 00:34:47,298
Good God, how many times

853
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,866
are you going to play right into his hands?

854
00:34:48,868 --> 00:34:50,234
We should figure something out here.

855
00:34:50,236 --> 00:34:51,502
I do not want to go to him.

856
00:34:51,504 --> 00:34:53,237
I know I shoved him down your throats,

857
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,905
but please trust me.

858
00:34:58,276 --> 00:35:00,511
I'm gonna need a sidearm.

859
00:35:12,666 --> 00:35:14,800
Warning system!
Three minutes till a meltdown!

860
00:35:14,802 --> 00:35:16,882
It's two minutes and 12 seconds, actually!

861
00:35:20,884 --> 00:35:23,185
What the hell is this?

862
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:24,654
This is our only chance.

863
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:27,699
- Walter!
- Why is an alarm going off?

864
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,992
Because we have two minutes
to avoid a meltdown.

865
00:35:31,962 --> 00:35:33,129
I need your access codes

866
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,264
for the antennas to send an analog signal.

867
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,241
Didn't work, Mark.

868
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:46,842
Mark, it didn't work.

869
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:48,811
Why you looking at me like that, Walter?

870
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,312
I need the code. That's all we need.

871
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,214
That's the same look you gave me the day

872
00:35:52,542 --> 00:35:55,743
that the ambulance came to
take me away for two years.

873
00:35:55,769 --> 00:35:57,135
The code, Collins.

874
00:35:57,161 --> 00:35:59,295
Nine-five-one.

875
00:36:01,624 --> 00:36:02,524
No, that's not it.

876
00:36:02,526 --> 00:36:04,326
Could've sworn it was 951.

877
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,694
951 days ago,

878
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:06,829
Mark and I disproved

879
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,897
a section of the Higgs boson theory.

880
00:36:08,899 --> 00:36:10,032
Excellent work!

881
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:11,633
It's 1199.

882
00:36:11,635 --> 00:36:13,402
What is happening here?

883
00:36:15,566 --> 00:36:18,340
I know Walter found out
that I set this whole thing up.

884
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,775
I was listening to your conversation

885
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:20,776
at the reactor base.

886
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:22,077
The whole place is mic'd.

887
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,078
Just over a minute left!

888
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,046
What the hell's the holdup?

889
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:25,781
Just give us the damn code!

890
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:27,883
Or what?

891
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:29,384
You'll shoot me?

892
00:36:30,553 --> 00:36:33,622
That only guarantees you'll fail.

893
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:36,625
Walter, how do you stand for
such intellectual inferiors?

894
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:38,593
- The code!
- I told you.

895
00:36:38,595 --> 00:36:40,228
It's 1199.

896
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,663
One-one-nine-nine.

897
00:36:41,665 --> 00:36:43,265
1,199 days ago...

898
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:45,500
it was May 20, it was a Thursday...

899
00:36:45,502 --> 00:36:47,536
we stayed up all night in a diner

900
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,272
discussing the quantum
mechanics of time travel.

901
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:51,973
We could have accomplished
anything together,

902
00:36:51,975 --> 00:36:53,174
but you ruined that.

903
00:36:53,176 --> 00:36:56,136
You hate me for what I did. I get it.

904
00:36:56,513 --> 00:36:58,780
And I always debate my decision,

905
00:36:58,782 --> 00:37:00,181
but this isn't the right solution.

906
00:37:00,183 --> 00:37:03,084
And having me locked up was?

907
00:37:03,086 --> 00:37:05,620
Do you have any idea how badly that hurt me?

908
00:37:08,925 --> 00:37:10,191
There's less than a minute.

909
00:37:10,193 --> 00:37:11,926
Do you think I'm afraid to die, Walter?

910
00:37:11,928 --> 00:37:13,928
I'm not afraid to die.

911
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,798
My life ended the day that you destroyed

912
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,366
our partnership, our friendship.

913
00:37:18,368 --> 00:37:21,069
I just wanted to show you
that I could save everyone.

914
00:37:21,071 --> 00:37:22,537
I just wanted back on the team.

915
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:23,838
Walter, that's it.

916
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,573
The day his life ended, the day he lost you.

917
00:37:25,575 --> 00:37:27,108
Seven hundred and eighty-two days.

918
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,042
What's the date?!

919
00:37:28,044 --> 00:37:29,911
August 22, 2012!

920
00:37:29,913 --> 00:37:31,779
No!

921
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,483
Look out, Sylvester!

922
00:37:35,485 --> 00:37:37,318
Come on, come on...

923
00:37:38,454 --> 00:37:40,455
All right, code's in, signal's up.

924
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:43,925
Did it work?

925
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:44,926
Walter?

926
00:37:55,238 --> 00:37:56,470
We're good.

927
00:37:56,472 --> 00:37:58,906
Oh...

928
00:37:58,908 --> 00:38:00,541
I know this might be awkward,

929
00:38:00,543 --> 00:38:03,177
but I, for one,
am against Mark rejoining the team.

930
00:38:05,347 --> 00:38:08,125
The wound was through
and through. Clean exit.

931
00:38:08,151 --> 00:38:09,450
They just brought him
back from the hospital.

932
00:38:09,452 --> 00:38:11,452
I should have kept a closer eye on Collins.

933
00:38:11,454 --> 00:38:12,787
Well, why didn't you?

934
00:38:12,789 --> 00:38:14,755
I was focused on the upgrade.

935
00:38:14,757 --> 00:38:16,891
You were focused on a friend.

936
00:38:16,893 --> 00:38:20,261
You were trying to make right
what happened between you guys.

937
00:38:20,263 --> 00:38:21,929
So you trusted him.

938
00:38:21,931 --> 00:38:23,631
That implies I feel guilt.

939
00:38:23,633 --> 00:38:27,968
Acting like a human
being is never a mistake.

940
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,537
Means you're evolving.

941
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:33,040
It's nice to see that
you're capable of that.

942
00:38:42,951 --> 00:38:44,952
This is pretty ironic, isn't it?

943
00:38:44,954 --> 00:38:47,221
First day I see you in years...

944
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:52,126
I'm back to lockup.

945
00:38:55,964 --> 00:38:59,233
I showed you the outer
limits of your intelligence

946
00:38:59,235 --> 00:39:01,101
and you couldn't handle it.

947
00:39:01,103 --> 00:39:04,438
You couldn't risk me, or anybody else,

948
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,107
jeopardizing your team,
your precious cyclone.

949
00:39:07,109 --> 00:39:09,076
They are worth it.

950
00:39:09,078 --> 00:39:11,411
Why them?

951
00:39:11,413 --> 00:39:13,847
Toby, Happy, Sylvester...

952
00:39:13,849 --> 00:39:15,882
they can't touch my abilities.

953
00:39:15,884 --> 00:39:18,985
So why wasn't there room for one more?

954
00:39:18,987 --> 00:39:20,253
But there was.

955
00:39:20,255 --> 00:39:21,855
Paige.

956
00:39:21,857 --> 00:39:23,290
She binds us.

957
00:39:26,594 --> 00:39:28,728
I'm going away.

958
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:31,364
But I'll get out...

959
00:39:34,235 --> 00:39:37,304
Maybe I'll see you back down
the rabbit hole, Walter.

960
00:39:37,306 --> 00:39:40,974
I... hope not.

961
00:39:57,525 --> 00:39:59,092
Hey.

962
00:39:59,094 --> 00:40:00,593
Hey.

963
00:40:00,595 --> 00:40:03,796
I never... thanked you

964
00:40:03,798 --> 00:40:06,165
for what you did for me back then,
with Collins.

965
00:40:07,568 --> 00:40:09,702
Pulling me away from that darkness.

966
00:40:09,704 --> 00:40:13,206
I didn't do it for a thank you.

967
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:15,808
I did it because you're...

968
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:16,809
my friend.

969
00:40:16,811 --> 00:40:19,278
I won't let you down again.

970
00:40:20,147 --> 00:40:21,714
So, um...

971
00:40:21,716 --> 00:40:24,017
Toby going after Collins

972
00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:26,652
to protect your honor?

973
00:40:26,654 --> 00:40:27,787
What was all that about?

974
00:40:27,789 --> 00:40:30,123
The shrink's crazier than all of us.

975
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:32,111
What a surprise.

976
00:40:45,038 --> 00:40:47,006
Hey, everyone.

977
00:40:47,008 --> 00:40:49,075
Hey. Uh, did we have, uh,

978
00:40:49,077 --> 00:40:50,443
a meeting scheduled? I...

979
00:40:50,445 --> 00:40:51,877
No. No, we just

980
00:40:51,879 --> 00:40:53,212
dropped by.

981
00:40:53,214 --> 00:40:54,480
Because even after you

982
00:40:54,482 --> 00:40:56,515
save the world,
you're still all lost in thought,

983
00:40:56,517 --> 00:40:58,451
doing your own separate projects.

984
00:40:58,453 --> 00:41:00,219
Tonight we have a group project.

985
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:01,554
Chicken piccata.

986
00:41:01,556 --> 00:41:03,456
I don't think we have a chicken thermometer.

987
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:05,724
Well, pizza would be more efficient.

988
00:41:05,726 --> 00:41:08,060
We're all going to get out
of our own heads for a while

989
00:41:08,062 --> 00:41:10,109
and cook Italian.

990
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:12,302
Sounds fine.

991
00:41:15,835 --> 00:41:18,003
Um, can you just...

992
00:41:19,806 --> 00:41:21,707
Okay.

993
00:41:23,037 --> 00:41:25,439
If you're trying me out to see
if I work with this team...

994
00:41:25,465 --> 00:41:27,264
-  Paige... - If that's what's
happening, and that it could

995
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,124
end up being a failure and I could get

996
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,417
discarded one day, just tell me.

997
00:41:31,419 --> 00:41:33,910
I can handle it. But don't do it to Ralph.

998
00:41:34,027 --> 00:41:36,522
He's grown attached to the team...
especially you... and I

999
00:41:36,524 --> 00:41:39,424
don't want to see him hurt.
You are one of us.

1000
00:41:39,426 --> 00:41:42,194
We can't do this without you.

1001
00:41:43,296 --> 00:41:44,763
Good?

1002
00:41:45,598 --> 00:41:48,433
Let's go cook some chicken piccata.

1003
00:41:49,569 --> 00:41:52,070
Measure twice, cut once.

1004
00:41:52,072 --> 00:41:55,340
Can we talk about the so-called
extra virgin olive oil industry?

1005
00:41:55,342 --> 00:41:57,109
Beaucoup fraud.

1006
00:41:58,044 --> 00:42:01,287
Kid's a natural.

and a 2014 Top Safety Pick Plus rating.

1009
00:43:55,594 --> 00:43:57,728
Cost of entry? A fortune.

1010
00:43:57,762 --> 00:43:59,563
Until now.

1011
00:43:59,598 --> 00:44:02,066
Hey Sarah, new Jetta?

1012
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:02,900
Yup.

1013
00:44:02,934 --> 00:44:04,568
Can I check it out?

1014
00:44:04,603 --> 00:44:05,736
Maybe at halftime?

1015
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:08,072
Introducing lots of new.

1016
00:44:08,106 --> 00:44:10,240
The new Volkswagen Jetta.

1017
00:44:10,275 --> 00:44:13,143
Isn't it time for German engineering?
