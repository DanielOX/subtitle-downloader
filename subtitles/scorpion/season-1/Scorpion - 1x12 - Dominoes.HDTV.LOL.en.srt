1
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,926
<i>My name is Walter O'Brien.</i>

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,559
<i>I have the fourth highest IQ</i>
<i><i><i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

3
00:00:09,561 --> 00:00:11,361
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

4
00:00:11,363 --> 00:00:13,897
<i>When I was 11, the FBI</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking NASA</i>

5
00:00:13,899 --> 00:00:16,633
<i>to get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

6
00:00:16,635 --> 00:00:18,802
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

7
00:00:18,804 --> 00:00:20,270
<i>tackling worldwide threats</i>

8
00:00:20,272 --> 00:00:21,805
<i>only we can solve.</i>

9
00:00:21,807 --> 00:00:23,607
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

10
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:25,308
<i>Sylvester's a human calculator.</i>

11
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,677
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

12
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,846
<i>Agent Cabe Gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

13
00:00:29,848 --> 00:00:32,082
<i>And Paige?</i>
<i>Well, Paige isn't like us.</i>

14
00:00:32,084 --> 00:00:34,551
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

15
00:00:34,553 --> 00:00:37,220
<i>while we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

16
00:00:37,222 --> 00:00:39,322
<i>Together, we are Scorpion.</i>

17
00:01:03,548 --> 00:01:05,715
Hello!

18
00:01:05,717 --> 00:01:07,017
Merry Christmas Eve, everybody.

19
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:08,184
Wow.

20
00:01:08,186 --> 00:01:10,220
Black Sabbath instead of
“White Christmas”?

21
00:01:10,222 --> 00:01:13,456
No way. Okay, we're all getting
into the Christmas spirit.

22
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:14,991
You know, we're kind of busy.

23
00:01:14,993 --> 00:01:17,060
Shocker. That's why I'm
bringing the celebration here.

24
00:01:17,062 --> 00:01:18,962
Tonight, we're going
to have dinner together.

25
00:01:18,964 --> 00:01:20,997
And yes, you have
to help decorate.

26
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,967
So, Ralph's a
little disappointed.

27
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:25,935
Drew had to head to Portland--
last-minute tryout

28
00:01:25,937 --> 00:01:27,570
for a minor league team.
TOBY Wow.

29
00:01:27,572 --> 00:01:28,805
Missing Christmas
with his son.

30
00:01:28,807 --> 00:01:30,440
That doesn't sound like him.
No, wait.

31
00:01:30,442 --> 00:01:32,709
That sounds exactly like him.
Drew wasn't happy

32
00:01:32,711 --> 00:01:35,178
about it, but they wanted to see
him throw before the manager

33
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,646
left for vacation
or something.

34
00:01:36,648 --> 00:01:38,682
Anyway, I want to soften
the blow for Ralph.

35
00:01:38,684 --> 00:01:40,050
Tree, lights, Santa.

36
00:01:40,052 --> 00:01:42,585
Gonna give him everything
this Christmas except for snow.

37
00:01:42,587 --> 00:01:43,853
Uh, news flash.

38
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:45,355
Ralph doesn't believe in Santa.

39
00:01:45,357 --> 00:01:46,523
You can be a genius

40
00:01:46,525 --> 00:01:48,091
and still believe
in things that are magical.

41
00:01:48,093 --> 00:01:50,960
Oh, speaking of... Santa,

42
00:01:50,962 --> 00:01:53,029
I have your gifts.

43
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:57,033
Happy, Paige got us gifts.

44
00:01:58,503 --> 00:02:00,070
You didn't get me anything,
did you?

45
00:02:01,273 --> 00:02:03,006
No problem. Happy.

46
00:02:04,676 --> 00:02:06,342
Sylvester.

47
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:08,678
And Toby.

48
00:02:09,448 --> 00:02:10,680
Oh.

49
00:02:10,682 --> 00:02:12,148
I miss my hat.

50
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,684
It's on a cliff
somewhere in Bosnia.

51
00:02:14,686 --> 00:02:16,219
Uh, this wrench
isn't functional.

52
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:18,521
They're ornaments.
Now all we need is a tree.

53
00:02:18,523 --> 00:02:20,790
And I can't figure out
what to get Walter.

54
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:23,059
What do you get somebody
with a 197 IQ?

55
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:24,561
Definitely not this stuff.

56
00:02:24,563 --> 00:02:25,762
Okay.

57
00:02:30,035 --> 00:02:33,403
I could have built
a better robot when I was five.

58
00:02:34,339 --> 00:02:37,807
I did build a better robot
when I was five.

59
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:39,909
Well, thank you for the gifts, Paige.
Sure.

60
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:41,544
You know, before my parents

61
00:02:41,546 --> 00:02:43,413
shipped me off
to live with my uncle,

62
00:02:43,415 --> 00:02:45,815
my dad bought me a weight set
for Christmas.

63
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:47,751
Which is crazy because

64
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:49,319
I'm big, not strong.

65
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:52,021
Uh, try a foster home
Christmas.

66
00:02:52,023 --> 00:02:53,423
They'd send me back
to the state

67
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:55,525
a week earlier so they wouldn't
have to get me a present.

68
00:02:55,527 --> 00:02:57,694
Do any of you have
good Christmas memories?

69
00:02:57,696 --> 00:02:59,062
I loved Christmas.

70
00:02:59,064 --> 00:03:02,465
My dad would wake me early,
and we'd rush downstairs.

71
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:03,900
Okay, now we're talking.

72
00:03:03,902 --> 00:03:05,201
Then we'd head straight
to off-track betting.

73
00:03:05,203 --> 00:03:06,636
It was magical.
The whole gang

74
00:03:06,638 --> 00:03:08,138
would be there--
Timmy No Shoes,

75
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,273
Smelly Jim, Pooter.

76
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:11,641
They taught me
how, on Christmas,

77
00:03:11,643 --> 00:03:13,676
you never bet the two
or the five horse.

78
00:03:13,678 --> 00:03:15,445
Nags put there for
superstitious suckers

79
00:03:15,447 --> 00:03:17,113
betting on the twenty-fifth.

80
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:18,948
Best of all, by the
time we got home,

81
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,584
my mom would be passed out
on the couch from the eggnog.

82
00:03:25,657 --> 00:03:27,857
That was.. that was almost worse
than Happy's.

83
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:30,360
I've-I've never heard people
so jaded about Christmas.

84
00:03:30,362 --> 00:03:31,594
I mean,

85
00:03:31,596 --> 00:03:33,096
who thinks that way?

86
00:03:33,098 --> 00:03:35,765
While Christmas has zero impact
on me personally,

87
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:38,835
it does provide people
with, um, psychological uplift,

88
00:03:38,837 --> 00:03:41,171
thus making workers
more productive,

89
00:03:41,173 --> 00:03:44,574
so the holiday
does have value.

90
00:03:44,576 --> 00:03:47,010
The point is to
be with family.

91
00:03:47,012 --> 00:03:48,111
That's what we're doing.

92
00:03:48,113 --> 00:03:49,646
Eating Fat Burger?

93
00:03:49,648 --> 00:03:51,281
It's not exactly
a holiday meal.

94
00:03:51,283 --> 00:03:54,150
Yours has bacon. That's
practically Christmas ham.

95
00:03:58,089 --> 00:03:59,923
That is just sad.

96
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:01,424
Hmm.

97
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,997
Excuse me. Hi.

98
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:10,800
The wind's not striking the sail
with enough velocity.

99
00:04:10,802 --> 00:04:13,469
This produces insubstantial
pressure on the face, and,

100
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:15,238
consequently,
not enough upward thrust

101
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,006
to counterbalance gravity.

102
00:04:19,044 --> 00:04:20,310
Got to turn your kite.

103
00:04:20,312 --> 00:04:22,045
Here.

104
00:04:22,047 --> 00:04:24,013
Thank you.

105
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:29,986
Oh.

106
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,958
How'd you know that?
I know a few things.

107
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,093
Did you know
that Ben Franklin-- he...?

108
00:04:37,095 --> 00:04:38,895
He discovered electricity
by flying a kite.

109
00:04:38,897 --> 00:04:39,897
No. If his kite

110
00:04:39,898 --> 00:04:41,631
had actually been struck
by lightning,

111
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:44,000
the key would have
electrocuted him.

112
00:04:44,002 --> 00:04:45,235
It's just a myth.

113
00:04:45,237 --> 00:04:47,537
- I like the way you think, kid.
- Owen,

114
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:48,271
leave the poor man alone.

115
00:04:48,273 --> 00:04:49,772
- Oh.
- Okay.

116
00:04:49,774 --> 00:04:51,608
Merry Christmas.

117
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,409
Yeah.

118
00:04:59,551 --> 00:05:02,585
Do you think it's ironic

119
00:05:02,587 --> 00:05:04,487
that Mom got you a kite
for Christmas,

120
00:05:04,489 --> 00:05:05,722
and you never used it?

121
00:05:05,724 --> 00:05:07,690
Oh, that's,
uh, not irony.

122
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:10,360
That's her
not understanding me.

123
00:05:10,362 --> 00:05:14,330
Yeah. You were never into
the holiday, even as a kid.

124
00:05:14,332 --> 00:05:16,432
It's because
I had more important things

125
00:05:16,434 --> 00:05:20,436
to occupy my time,
like the Rohaxinal study.

126
00:05:20,438 --> 00:05:22,639
I pulled
some favors.

127
00:05:22,641 --> 00:05:23,773
You're in.

128
00:05:23,775 --> 00:05:25,708
I...

129
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,977
I don't want
to be a guinea pig.

130
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,913
Well, that drug has

131
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:31,080
some serious side effects.

132
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:32,782
It could save your life.

133
00:05:32,784 --> 00:05:34,550
You've seen
the test results, Walt.

134
00:05:34,552 --> 00:05:36,853
At this point,
I don't need a new drug.

135
00:05:36,855 --> 00:05:38,087
I need a miracle.

136
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:40,924
There is no such thing!

137
00:05:40,926 --> 00:05:44,394
All right, do know how
Jonas Salk cured polio?

138
00:05:44,396 --> 00:05:48,364
With science, not by singing
about snowmen and reindeer.

139
00:05:48,366 --> 00:05:50,733
Well, sometimes you need
a little faith.

140
00:05:50,735 --> 00:05:53,002
I do have faith,
just in things that are real.

141
00:05:54,372 --> 00:05:55,805
Are we having an earthquake?

142
00:05:57,676 --> 00:06:00,243
It's a rock slide.

143
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:01,344
Owen!

144
00:06:01,346 --> 00:06:03,112
Help!

145
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:05,448
He's trapped!

146
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:07,951
Oh, my God.

147
00:06:09,387 --> 00:06:11,321
Owen's down there!

148
00:06:11,323 --> 00:06:12,822
Wait. Down where?

149
00:06:12,824 --> 00:06:15,825
He was in the cave, and the
bluff just started to come down.

150
00:06:15,827 --> 00:06:16,960
Owen! Owen!

151
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:18,861
The ground just
opened up.

152
00:06:18,863 --> 00:06:20,296
He fell in. It happened so fast.

153
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:22,131
Owen! What do you mean,
the ground just opened up?

154
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:23,333
It's a sinkhole.

155
00:06:23,335 --> 00:06:24,534
Rock slides often start

156
00:06:24,536 --> 00:06:26,769
with small seismic shifts
at ground level.

157
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:28,204
It's common in California.
It can cause

158
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:30,139
a small, spontaneous hole,
especially in sand.

159
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:31,541
Oh, my God!

160
00:06:31,543 --> 00:06:33,076
He's buried alive!
No, no, no.

161
00:06:33,078 --> 00:06:34,344
Not necessarily.

162
00:06:34,346 --> 00:06:36,679
Sinkholes very rarely self-fill.

163
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:38,681
There's a good chance he's stuck
in a hollow right now.

164
00:06:38,683 --> 00:06:40,049
We need the L.A.
Fire Department,

165
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:42,251
Army Corps of Engineers,
anyone that can help.

166
00:06:42,253 --> 00:06:43,720
Copy that. But who
the hell are you?

167
00:06:43,722 --> 00:06:45,521
I'm with Homeland.

168
00:06:45,523 --> 00:06:47,857
I know some people.
We can help.

169
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:59,068
Touch it, and you will have
a blue Christmas.

170
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,336
I helped, too.

171
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:02,739
Walter designed it, Sylvester
calculated it, I built it.

172
00:07:02,741 --> 00:07:04,240
What was your job?
Moral support.

173
00:07:04,242 --> 00:07:05,441
Toby,

174
00:07:05,443 --> 00:07:06,876
a few weeks ago,
I was in a hospital

175
00:07:06,878 --> 00:07:08,277
getting shrapnel
taken out of my chest,

176
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,747
and I still did more work
for this project than you did.

177
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:12,415
Grinch.

178
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:13,816
Hey, guys,
Walter just called.

179
00:07:13,818 --> 00:07:15,885
There's a ten-year-old
boy trapped in

180
00:07:15,887 --> 00:07:17,020
a sinkhole at Zuma Beach.

181
00:07:17,022 --> 00:07:18,254
Let's go.

182
00:07:21,326 --> 00:07:24,060
Zuma Beach is on high alert,
as a ten-year-old boy is trapped

183
00:07:24,062 --> 00:07:26,129
one and a half stories
below the earth's surface.

184
00:07:26,131 --> 00:07:27,463
Walter!

185
00:07:27,465 --> 00:07:29,298
We have seen emergency
crews arriving on scene...

186
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,005
Yeah?

187
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:31,735
We were listening
to the news on the way here.

188
00:07:31,736 --> 00:07:34,037
Okay. We'll start off by
getting you up to speed.

189
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:36,406
This is Dan Heather,
Army Corps of Engineers,

190
00:07:36,408 --> 00:07:37,774
Geotech Division. Dan?

191
00:07:37,776 --> 00:07:39,509
Mind filling my guys in?

192
00:07:39,511 --> 00:07:43,813
Those boulders up here
are blocking access to the boy.

193
00:07:43,815 --> 00:07:47,150
He's trapped in a sinkhole
14 feet deep underground here.

194
00:07:47,152 --> 00:07:49,719
If we use heavy machinery
to move them,

195
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:51,387
ground shifts will cause
the sinkhole to collapse,

196
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:53,356
which means
we have no way to reach him.

197
00:07:53,358 --> 00:07:55,158
Oh, my God.
But it gets worse.

198
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,225
We can't get in,

199
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:57,227
but water can.

200
00:07:57,228 --> 00:07:58,561
There are gaps

201
00:07:58,563 --> 00:08:00,029
between those rocks.

202
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:02,365
Waves are dumping down 30
gallons of seawater per minute.

203
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:05,068
We're putting sandbags
to restrict the flow,

204
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,869
but tide is too strong.

205
00:08:06,871 --> 00:08:08,304
The hole is filling up fast.

206
00:08:08,306 --> 00:08:09,572
Dimensions of the hole?

207
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:11,707
Best guess: 1,100 cubic feet.

208
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:13,776
Taking into account
the water displacement

209
00:08:13,778 --> 00:08:16,479
due to an average-sized
ten-year-old boy, he will drown

210
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:17,980
in one hour and 22 minutes.

211
00:08:17,982 --> 00:08:19,882
You can't drill
to him before then?

212
00:08:19,884 --> 00:08:22,051
A CalTrans team offered
to help.

213
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:24,854
They have the right drills, but
the sand is incredibly unstable.

214
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:28,057
Normally, we'd drill
at a steep angle,

215
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:29,992
but that could cause a cave-in,
killing him instantly.

216
00:08:29,994 --> 00:08:33,796
Instead, we're digging at a
shallow angle, farther away.

217
00:08:33,798 --> 00:08:35,565
But progress is slow.

218
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:37,300
Doesn't help, this
entire bluff's unstable

219
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:39,469
and could re-slide at
any time, burying him.

220
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:41,604
Follow me.

221
00:08:41,606 --> 00:08:42,738
Where's his parents?

222
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,040
Driving back
from up north.

223
00:08:44,042 --> 00:08:46,142
Bringing his grandparents
back for Christmas.

224
00:08:46,144 --> 00:08:47,710
Babysitter's trying
to get ahold of them.

225
00:08:47,712 --> 00:08:49,912
Speaking of communication,
we need a way to talk to Owen,

226
00:08:49,914 --> 00:08:51,380
find out his exact location.

227
00:08:51,382 --> 00:08:54,217
So you don't drill through the
sinkhole wall and impale him.

228
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:55,585
That's right.

229
00:08:55,587 --> 00:08:57,753
We considered flying in
a high-tech sound wave device

230
00:08:57,755 --> 00:08:59,021
from Nellis Air
Force Base, but...

231
00:08:59,023 --> 00:09:00,523
Even an HH-60
helicopter

232
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:02,625
with a top speed
of 195 knots

233
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:04,127
wouldn't get here
for another 86 minutes,

234
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:06,095
and that's four minutes after
the hole would be full of water.

235
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:07,463
The sinkhole is in there,

236
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:08,465
under that rock.

237
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:09,732
No way the kid can hear us.

238
00:09:09,734 --> 00:09:11,100
No. I've got a way.

239
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:16,272
Okay, Walter,
I really don't feel

240
00:09:16,274 --> 00:09:18,141
comfortable being in
a cave that was formed

241
00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:21,177
by a rock slide that happened
less than an hour ago.

242
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:22,445
Oh, no.

243
00:09:22,447 --> 00:09:24,680
Guys, okay,
Owen is right under there.

244
00:09:24,682 --> 00:09:29,185
But we can't dig a rescue tunnel
this close to Owen, but CalTrans

245
00:09:29,187 --> 00:09:31,487
can auger an eight-inch
diameter tunnel

246
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:32,788
at a 75 degree angle.

247
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,423
Small enough not
to compromise the sinkhole.

248
00:09:34,425 --> 00:09:36,759
Use a collapsible mast drill
bit so if it accidentally

249
00:09:36,761 --> 00:09:39,462
hits the kid's body, it'll
retract without major injury.

250
00:09:39,464 --> 00:09:40,596
In this soft sand,

251
00:09:40,598 --> 00:09:41,831
they'll reach
him in minutes.

252
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:42,899
We need a PVC pipe.

253
00:09:42,901 --> 00:09:44,267
I saw some on the
CalTrans truck.

254
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:46,369
Okay, how do we
communicate with Owen?

255
00:09:46,371 --> 00:09:48,404
Do you have some kind
of high-tech device?

256
00:09:48,406 --> 00:09:50,039
As a matter of fact, I do.

257
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:54,610
Pipe is secure.

258
00:09:54,612 --> 00:09:56,879
If he's alive, we can
send scuba gear down

259
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:59,815
so he can breathe when
the water gets too high.

260
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:01,517
All right. Get that there.

261
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,619
Let me see this.

262
00:10:05,056 --> 00:10:06,155
Come on, Owen.

263
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:10,693
Come on.

264
00:10:12,564 --> 00:10:13,729
Hello?

265
00:10:13,731 --> 00:10:14,564
Hey.

266
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:15,566
Owen. Owen.

267
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:16,699
My name's Walter O'Brien.

268
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:18,267
I helped you with your kite.

269
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:19,835
Me and my friends
are here to help you.

270
00:10:19,837 --> 00:10:22,038
- Please, get me out of here.
- We're working on it

271
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,173
now, okay, but it's gonna
take some time.

272
00:10:24,175 --> 00:10:25,708
Where are my mom and dad?

273
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,310
I want my mom and dad.

274
00:10:27,312 --> 00:10:28,811
We're trying to
reach out to them.

275
00:10:28,813 --> 00:10:30,513
Put him on mute
for one second.

276
00:10:30,515 --> 00:10:32,448
That rapid breathing
and confusion--

277
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,317
if he goes into shock, he could
pass out and slump down.

278
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:36,819
And there's already enough water
in there that he'll drown.

279
00:10:36,821 --> 00:10:38,354
We need to keep him calm.

280
00:10:38,356 --> 00:10:41,490
Walter! I got
his parents.

281
00:10:41,492 --> 00:10:43,292
Uh, Owen?

282
00:10:43,294 --> 00:10:45,294
Owen, we got your parents
on the phone, okay?

283
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:47,530
Hold on a sec. Hi.

284
00:10:47,532 --> 00:10:50,800
Uh, now I'm gonna hold the phone
up so your son can hear you.

285
00:10:50,802 --> 00:10:52,134
Okay.

286
00:10:52,136 --> 00:10:53,402
Owen, can you hear me?

287
00:10:53,404 --> 00:10:55,538
Dad! I want to go home.

288
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,573
I know you do.
We'll be there soon.

289
00:10:57,575 --> 00:10:58,507
Where are you?

290
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:00,209
Sweetheart, it's Mom.

291
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:02,511
We're coming, baby.
We're driving as fast as we can.

292
00:11:02,513 --> 00:11:05,014
The phone's dying.

293
00:11:05,016 --> 00:11:06,515
We don't have a charger.

294
00:11:06,517 --> 00:11:08,618
Owen, listen, we don't
have a lot of time to talk.

295
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,919
Don't hang up!

296
00:11:09,921 --> 00:11:11,320
I love you so much, baby.

297
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:13,055
Son, we're gonna
get cut off soon.

298
00:11:13,057 --> 00:11:14,090
Please, don't be afraid.

299
00:11:14,092 --> 00:11:16,025
We're gonna get to you,
and when we do,

300
00:11:16,027 --> 00:11:17,326
Mommy and I are gonna
hold you, sweetie,

301
00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:18,461
and we're never gonna let you...

302
00:11:18,463 --> 00:11:21,397
Dad? Dad!

303
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:23,733
Phone's dead.

304
00:11:25,336 --> 00:11:27,303
Guys, remember what I said
about keeping him calm. Paige.

305
00:11:27,305 --> 00:11:30,072
Owen.

306
00:11:30,074 --> 00:11:31,974
My name is Paige. I'm a mom.

307
00:11:31,976 --> 00:11:34,043
I have a ten-year-old son, too.
Can I sit in for your parents

308
00:11:34,045 --> 00:11:35,544
until they get here
and just talk to you?

309
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:37,747
It's almost Christmas.

310
00:11:37,749 --> 00:11:40,116
Do you decorate
your-your tree with, um,

311
00:11:40,118 --> 00:11:41,817
candy canes
and ornaments?

312
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:45,021
My dad strings popcorn.
We do, too.

313
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,323
We make a super long one, and
we wrap it all the way around.

314
00:11:47,325 --> 00:11:48,991
Hey, he's doing better.
Keep going.

315
00:11:48,993 --> 00:11:50,726
What else do you do
for Christmas?

316
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:53,796
We... we watch Christmas movies.

317
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:54,930
Yeah?

318
00:11:54,932 --> 00:11:56,699
Something's off
with his breathing.

319
00:11:58,536 --> 00:12:00,369
Hey, Owen!

320
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:01,971
Listen, I'm a doctor.

321
00:12:01,973 --> 00:12:03,306
Tell me, does your chest hurt?

322
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:04,540
Yeah.

323
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:06,709
I hit a rock when I fell.

324
00:12:06,711 --> 00:12:10,012
Oh. Uh, would you mind
looking up for me?

325
00:12:10,014 --> 00:12:11,981
Ah, thanks, buddy.

326
00:12:11,983 --> 00:12:14,717
Listen, you're doing great.
Just hold on one second, okay?

327
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,319
I put him on mute.

328
00:12:16,321 --> 00:12:17,887
He-he has distended neck veins.

329
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:20,189
That's sign of a pneumothorax,
a collapsed lung.

330
00:12:20,191 --> 00:12:22,558
It's probably from a broken rib
piercing it; but we cannot

331
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,193
use that scuba gear.

332
00:12:24,195 --> 00:12:25,795
The compressed air
will kill him.

333
00:12:25,797 --> 00:12:27,663
And that's gonna be a problem.

334
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:28,898
Because...

335
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,965
I just realized

336
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:31,200
I didn't account
for the tidal changes

337
00:12:31,202 --> 00:12:32,935
when I calculated
how long it was going to take

338
00:12:32,937 --> 00:12:34,537
for Owen to be submerged.

339
00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:36,138
I made a big mistake.

340
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,540
I'm so sorry.

341
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:39,742
What's the adjustment?

342
00:12:39,744 --> 00:12:41,844
We don't have an hour
and 22 minutes to save him.

343
00:12:41,846 --> 00:12:43,346
If we can't get him
out of there,

344
00:12:43,348 --> 00:12:45,581
he's going to drown
in 56 minutes.

345
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:52,088
Tension is building
here at Zuma Beach,

346
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,423
as we have learned
that ten-year-old Owen Cooper

347
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:57,760
has less than an hour until
he's completely underwater.

348
00:12:57,762 --> 00:13:00,930
Rescue crews are tunneling in
in an attempt to reach him

349
00:13:00,932 --> 00:13:03,399
and hopefully get him out
in time.

350
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:05,067
We need this
done now!

351
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:06,069
Going as fast as I can.

352
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,403
There's no other option?

353
00:13:07,405 --> 00:13:08,405
No.

354
00:13:08,406 --> 00:13:09,839
Walter.

355
00:13:09,841 --> 00:13:11,807
Owen, we're gonna drill to you
and lift you out, okay?

356
00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:12,775
Just hang tough.

357
00:13:12,777 --> 00:13:14,276
- You can't.
- We can.

358
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:16,612
Our team's handled
challenging situations before.

359
00:13:16,614 --> 00:13:18,781
No. You can't lift me.

360
00:13:18,783 --> 00:13:20,649
I'm stuck.

361
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:21,550
What do you mean?

362
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:24,453
A rock has my leg pinned down.

363
00:13:24,455 --> 00:13:26,789
Okay, just point the phone
at your leg, please.

364
00:13:30,862 --> 00:13:32,962
Rock looks to be

365
00:13:32,964 --> 00:13:34,764
a couple hundred pounds.
Even if we get there

366
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:35,865
before he's submerged,

367
00:13:35,867 --> 00:13:37,867
how the hell do we get
that rock off of him?

368
00:13:37,869 --> 00:13:38,869
I'm cold.

369
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,870
Please get me out of here.
Please!

370
00:13:40,872 --> 00:13:43,172
We're gonna figure this out.
Everything's gonna be okay.

371
00:13:43,174 --> 00:13:46,041
I'm gonna talk
to the fire department.

372
00:13:46,043 --> 00:13:47,910
I'm scared.
I know, honey.

373
00:13:47,912 --> 00:13:49,245
And you're doing so great.

374
00:13:49,247 --> 00:13:52,181
You... I'm so proud of you.

375
00:13:52,183 --> 00:13:54,417
Let's talk about
something nice, okay?

376
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:56,519
Um... do you like
Christmas books?

377
00:13:56,521 --> 00:14:00,423
My son Ralph's, his favorite is
<i>I Want an Alien for Christmas.</i>

378
00:14:00,425 --> 00:14:01,624
I know that book.

379
00:14:01,626 --> 00:14:04,527
You do? Great.
What's your favorite part?

380
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:05,728
Paige?

381
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,330
Could I die in here?

382
00:14:10,234 --> 00:14:12,635
Owen...

383
00:14:12,637 --> 00:14:15,204
the people helping you
are special, okay?

384
00:14:15,206 --> 00:14:16,972
They won't let that happen
to you.

385
00:14:16,974 --> 00:14:20,843
Fire department is proposing
a last-ditch idea.

386
00:14:20,845 --> 00:14:22,144
It's not pleasant.

387
00:14:22,146 --> 00:14:23,679
Amputate his leg?

388
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,949
We can't. The vibrations
from the bone saw

389
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:29,452
would collapse the sinkhole.

390
00:14:32,123 --> 00:14:34,557
We're up against the one thing
humans have never been able

391
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,891
to defeat: time.

392
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:38,127
When half a million kids a year
were contracting polio,

393
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:40,329
you think Jonas Salk
felt like you do?

394
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:41,764
But when he hit
a wall, he shoved it

395
00:14:41,766 --> 00:14:44,033
out of the way
and he kept going.

396
00:14:44,035 --> 00:14:46,335
I have faith in a lot
of things, Walter,

397
00:14:46,337 --> 00:14:48,637
but I especially have faith
in you.

398
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:53,342
You're right.
In-Instead of thinking

399
00:14:53,344 --> 00:14:54,877
about how to move Owen's leg,

400
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:56,545
we should be thinking
about how to move the wall.

401
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:59,715
Or, in this case, the boulder.
Thank you!

402
00:15:00,518 --> 00:15:03,052
Here, Paige, Paige, Paige.
Owen? Owen?

403
00:15:03,054 --> 00:15:04,887
I'm gonna go off Skype
for a minute

404
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:07,022
to take a look at that video
I recorded of your leg.

405
00:15:07,024 --> 00:15:08,824
Don't go!
It's just gonna take 60 seconds.

406
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:09,959
No!

407
00:15:09,961 --> 00:15:11,293
Owen, I-I want you
to start counting,

408
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:13,295
and when you get to 60,
I promise we're gonna be

409
00:15:13,297 --> 00:15:14,663
right back together, okay?
You can do this.

410
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:16,398
I'll-I'll get
started. Ready?

411
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,133
One, two,

412
00:15:18,135 --> 00:15:19,702
three...

413
00:15:19,704 --> 00:15:22,304
Four, five, six...

414
00:15:22,306 --> 00:15:23,873
Good.

415
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,475
You have 54 seconds.
Then I take that tablet back.

416
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,045
Okay, we need
a device small enough

417
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,914
to fit through
that tiny crack,

418
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,983
but powerful enough
to lift that rock.

419
00:15:33,985 --> 00:15:36,452
As soon as they're done digging,
we'll bring in a car jack.

420
00:15:36,454 --> 00:15:38,153
Car jack's
a brute tool.

421
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:39,321
We need
something sensitive enough

422
00:15:39,323 --> 00:15:41,557
to exert the exact amount
of force required.

423
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,058
The rocks are so unstable.

424
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,627
We disturb them too much,
one will collapse

425
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:45,794
after the other, like dominoes.

426
00:15:45,796 --> 00:15:46,962
It'll crush him.

427
00:15:46,964 --> 00:15:48,397
The boulder appears
to be approximately

428
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,565
40 inches high.

429
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:52,234
We need to raise it
between 1.8 and 2.3 inches.

430
00:15:52,236 --> 00:15:53,903
Any less, we won't free his leg.

431
00:15:53,905 --> 00:15:56,605
Any more, the whole sinkhole
could collapse.

432
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:58,774
1.8 or 2.3?

433
00:15:58,776 --> 00:16:01,977
Sylvester, that's almost
a-a 28% differential.

434
00:16:01,979 --> 00:16:03,345
It's the best
I can give you right now.

435
00:16:03,347 --> 00:16:05,147
Sylvester, we need...
we need better.

436
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:06,882
What is wrong with you today?

437
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:08,884
Get your head on right.

438
00:16:10,788 --> 00:16:13,055
HAPPY Uh, we need something
like a micro-jack.

439
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:16,058
I could build one with
parts I have at the garage.

440
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,960
It'll go faster
with help.

441
00:16:17,962 --> 00:16:18,794
I'll go with you.

442
00:16:18,796 --> 00:16:20,529
What's the use

443
00:16:20,531 --> 00:16:24,133
if this kid's underwater by the
time they bring back this jack?

444
00:16:24,135 --> 00:16:25,501
I've already accounted for that.

445
00:16:25,503 --> 00:16:27,803
For Owen to stay alive,
he needs to stop breathing.

446
00:16:27,805 --> 00:16:29,738
What the hell
are you talking about?

447
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,040
I'll explain on the way.
Come on.

448
00:16:33,755 --> 00:16:37,755

450
00:16:43,156 --> 00:16:45,489
Walter O'Brien, Agent Gallo,
we've been expecting you.

451
00:16:45,491 --> 00:16:47,358
The ECMO machine
you requested.

452
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,160
This isn't 40 feet.

453
00:16:49,162 --> 00:16:50,595
We thought you said 14 feet.

454
00:16:50,597 --> 00:16:51,562
No, 40 feet.

455
00:16:51,564 --> 00:16:52,797
Now.

456
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:54,732
Walter, they're just trying
to help, too.

457
00:17:00,907 --> 00:17:04,108
Find me a U-channel wedge,
a quarter-inch thread drive rod,

458
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,777
a reinforced shoulder bolt,
and three steel lid stays.

459
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:08,279
I don't understand
half of what you said.

460
00:17:08,281 --> 00:17:10,615
Then start with the other half.
Prepping the kiln.

461
00:17:10,617 --> 00:17:13,551
Uh... got
the wedge,

462
00:17:13,553 --> 00:17:16,187
uh, drive rod, and...

463
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:17,255
shoulder bolt.

464
00:17:17,257 --> 00:17:18,723
You know more than you let on.

465
00:17:18,725 --> 00:17:20,024
I watch you work sometimes.

466
00:17:20,026 --> 00:17:21,192
Thank you
for making this creepy.

467
00:17:21,194 --> 00:17:23,060
Now find the other parts.

468
00:17:26,766 --> 00:17:28,366
Is it gonna hit me?

469
00:17:28,368 --> 00:17:29,200
It shouldn't.

470
00:17:29,202 --> 00:17:30,668
It won't.

471
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,604
Just lean as far back as you
can, Owen. You can do this.

472
00:17:41,848 --> 00:17:43,281
It's tight in there.

473
00:17:43,283 --> 00:17:45,950
This isn't a science.

474
00:17:45,952 --> 00:17:47,918
God help this kid.

475
00:17:49,822 --> 00:17:51,555
Stop the drill!

476
00:17:55,094 --> 00:17:58,095
All right, guys, I'm gonna
back this bad boy out of here.

477
00:17:58,097 --> 00:17:59,030
Come on. Let's move!

478
00:18:03,069 --> 00:18:05,903
We need some men up here! Now!

479
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,506
Okay, we got it here,

480
00:18:08,508 --> 00:18:10,074
but explain how this helps us.

481
00:18:10,076 --> 00:18:11,676
We need to keep Owen alive

482
00:18:11,678 --> 00:18:13,110
until the jack gets here,

483
00:18:13,112 --> 00:18:14,545
but that's not gonna be
until he's underwater.

484
00:18:14,547 --> 00:18:15,713
So we need to bypass

485
00:18:15,715 --> 00:18:18,649
his respiratory system,
which is what this is for.

486
00:18:18,651 --> 00:18:19,684
It's an extracorporeal

487
00:18:19,686 --> 00:18:22,953
membrane oxygenation system,
or an ECMO.

488
00:18:22,955 --> 00:18:25,189
Where'd you learn how to do this?
On the Internet.

489
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:26,657
He's not kidding.

490
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:28,025
Okay, so...

491
00:18:28,027 --> 00:18:31,028
we get the tubes and needles
in the PVC pipe, and then...

492
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,229
Hold on.

493
00:18:32,231 --> 00:18:33,564
We haven't even
started putting supports

494
00:18:33,566 --> 00:18:35,032
in the tunnel
we just dug.

495
00:18:35,034 --> 00:18:36,534
Until that's done,
it's unstable,

496
00:18:36,536 --> 00:18:38,803
and the risk of collapse
is substantial.

497
00:18:38,805 --> 00:18:40,371
I need exact probabilities.

498
00:18:40,373 --> 00:18:41,373
I can't give them.

499
00:18:41,374 --> 00:18:43,040
Okay, I know someone who can.

500
00:18:43,042 --> 00:18:44,175
Come with me.

501
00:18:44,177 --> 00:18:47,278
Paige, tell my mom I'm sorry.

502
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,479
Why is that, honey?

503
00:18:49,482 --> 00:18:52,783
She told me not-not to go
in the caves, but...

504
00:18:52,785 --> 00:18:55,519
I wanted to find
the pink shells,

505
00:18:55,521 --> 00:18:57,488
the ones she likes.
Owen...

506
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,190
It's my fault.
This is not your fault.

507
00:18:59,192 --> 00:19:00,558
It's my fault!

508
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,560
Paige!

509
00:19:01,561 --> 00:19:02,526
Where's Sylvester?

510
00:19:02,528 --> 00:19:04,462
I need him to work out
some odds for me.

511
00:19:04,464 --> 00:19:06,731
I have no idea, but this child
is starting to break.

512
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:07,898
I don't know
how much longer

513
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,033
he's gonna last down there.

514
00:19:09,035 --> 00:19:11,035
And it kills me,
but the tunnel is not stable.

515
00:19:11,037 --> 00:19:12,203
And neither is Owen.

516
00:19:17,477 --> 00:19:18,642
That's it. I'm going in.

517
00:19:18,644 --> 00:19:20,244
Absolutely not.

518
00:19:20,246 --> 00:19:22,847
None of my men, not the LAPD
or the fire department--

519
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:25,316
no one has been given
authorization to go down

520
00:19:25,318 --> 00:19:26,550
until the tunnel
is ready.

521
00:19:26,552 --> 00:19:28,152
I don't work for
any of those entities.

522
00:19:28,154 --> 00:19:29,453
I don't need
your authorization.

523
00:19:29,455 --> 00:19:31,355
Hopefully, I'll see
you in five minutes.

524
00:19:31,357 --> 00:19:32,490
Hopefully.

525
00:19:32,492 --> 00:19:34,058
If not,
who would've thought

526
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,559
I'd be the one to outlive you.

527
00:19:36,863 --> 00:19:38,529
Okay, you guys

528
00:19:38,531 --> 00:19:39,697
man the ECMO.

529
00:19:39,699 --> 00:19:41,132
I'll take care
of the rest.

530
00:19:41,134 --> 00:19:43,634
<i> As this saga</i>
<i>at Zuma Beach continues</i>

531
00:19:43,636 --> 00:19:45,403
<i>to unfold, Walter O'Brien,</i>

532
00:19:45,405 --> 00:19:47,705
a freelance contractor
with Homeland Security,

533
00:19:47,707 --> 00:19:50,775
is heading down into the earth
in what can only be described

534
00:19:50,777 --> 00:19:52,877
as a very risky endeavor.

535
00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:54,912
Owen! Hold on!

536
00:19:54,914 --> 00:19:56,180
I'm coming for you!

537
00:19:56,182 --> 00:19:57,548
Owen!

538
00:19:58,384 --> 00:20:00,918
Owen!

539
00:20:01,754 --> 00:20:03,888
Owen.

540
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,356
It's Walter.
Can you hear me?

541
00:20:05,358 --> 00:20:07,124
The water's getting higher!
Hold on!

542
00:20:07,126 --> 00:20:08,058
I'm almost to you!

543
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,593
Hurry.

544
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,533
Please get me out of here.
Okay.

545
00:20:15,535 --> 00:20:16,934
You've handled
this so well.

546
00:20:16,936 --> 00:20:18,569
You've impressed me;
it's hard to impress me.

547
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:19,904
Now, my friends
are working

548
00:20:19,906 --> 00:20:21,238
on a device to free your leg,

549
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,907
so I will get you out of here.

550
00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:25,276
Now, you will be with your
parents for Christmas, okay?

551
00:20:25,278 --> 00:20:27,511
Okay. Okay.

552
00:20:27,513 --> 00:20:28,779
But I won't be able to free you

553
00:20:28,781 --> 00:20:30,047
before the water covers
your head.

554
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:31,582
I-I don't understand.

555
00:20:31,584 --> 00:20:33,451
Well, you have to trust me.
I found a way

556
00:20:33,453 --> 00:20:36,086
for you to stay alive
without ever taking a breath.

557
00:20:36,088 --> 00:20:37,388
All right?
All right?

558
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,823
Send it down!

559
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:50,100
Owen, there's a machine up top.

560
00:20:50,102 --> 00:20:52,169
It'll take the blood
from your body,

561
00:20:52,171 --> 00:20:53,737
add oxygen to it,

562
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:55,739
and then send it back
into your blood, okay?

563
00:20:55,741 --> 00:20:59,009
It's used in surgeries. Only
you're special 'cause you'll...

564
00:20:59,011 --> 00:21:01,445
you'll be the first person
to ever do it while conscious.

565
00:21:01,447 --> 00:21:03,280
<i>We've been able to jump</i>

566
00:21:03,282 --> 00:21:04,882
on the rescuers' Wi-Fi signal,

567
00:21:04,884 --> 00:21:09,520
and we can now watch this
incredible drama unfold live.

568
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:13,858
Give me your arms.

569
00:21:16,629 --> 00:21:20,130
You're gonna feel a pinch
when I insert these needles.

570
00:21:20,132 --> 00:21:23,067
It's like a shot at the doctor,
only deeper, okay?

571
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:25,069
One, two, three.

572
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:27,671
I know this hurts,

573
00:21:27,673 --> 00:21:28,806
but you're doing great.

574
00:21:28,808 --> 00:21:31,175
Give me the other arm.

575
00:21:31,177 --> 00:21:33,444
All right. Okay, okay.

576
00:21:33,446 --> 00:21:35,446
They're in.

577
00:21:42,555 --> 00:21:44,588
Can't believe this is working.

578
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:49,026
I know from our Ben Franklin
conversation that you're smart,

579
00:21:49,028 --> 00:21:50,327
so I'm gonna explain
something to you

580
00:21:50,329 --> 00:21:52,129
that I know that
you'll understand.

581
00:21:52,131 --> 00:21:55,466
In less than one minute, we're
gonna be completely underwater.

582
00:21:55,468 --> 00:21:57,301
Your primordial brain

583
00:21:57,303 --> 00:21:59,570
will tell you to breathe in.
You cannot.

584
00:21:59,572 --> 00:22:00,938
No matter how badly

585
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,108
you want air, do not breathe
in once you're under, okay?

586
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,376
That's how people drown.

587
00:22:05,378 --> 00:22:08,145
It's not gonna be easy,
but I know you can do it.

588
00:22:08,147 --> 00:22:09,647
I need to breathe!
No, no, no.

589
00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:11,015
Look at me,
look at me.

590
00:22:11,017 --> 00:22:12,182
You need oxygen.

591
00:22:12,184 --> 00:22:13,817
And these tubes

592
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:15,019
will bring it to you.

593
00:22:15,021 --> 00:22:17,488
You just have faith
that the science will work.

594
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,923
I can't live underwater.

595
00:22:18,925 --> 00:22:20,190
Yes, you can.

596
00:22:20,192 --> 00:22:21,892
We all have-- in the womb,

597
00:22:21,894 --> 00:22:24,361
w-when we were
surrounded by fluid

598
00:22:24,363 --> 00:22:26,864
and oxygen got to us
without us even breathing.

599
00:22:26,866 --> 00:22:28,699
That's all this is.

600
00:22:28,701 --> 00:22:31,635
Okay? Now, I'm gonna
stay with you,

601
00:22:31,637 --> 00:22:34,071
I'm gonna hold your hand
as long as I can.

602
00:22:34,073 --> 00:22:35,639
And then it's
up to you.

603
00:22:35,641 --> 00:22:38,509
When I go up, I want you
to count to 15,

604
00:22:38,511 --> 00:22:41,412
and then knock on the pipe
so we know you're okay.

605
00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:47,151
After I get the jack
to free your leg,

606
00:22:47,153 --> 00:22:49,186
I'm gonna be
right back down here.

607
00:22:49,188 --> 00:22:50,688
Okay?
Yeah.

608
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,690
So what are you gonna do?

609
00:22:51,691 --> 00:22:53,057
Knock on the pipe.

610
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:54,692
Okay. Are you gonna breathe?

611
00:22:54,694 --> 00:22:55,759
No.

612
00:22:55,761 --> 00:22:57,194
You promise me?

613
00:22:57,196 --> 00:22:58,963
I promise.

614
00:22:58,965 --> 00:23:00,965
You promise you'll come back.

615
00:23:00,967 --> 00:23:04,101
I promise you
I will come back.

616
00:23:04,103 --> 00:23:06,737
And I only state facts.

617
00:23:09,141 --> 00:23:10,941
It cut out.

618
00:23:14,013 --> 00:23:17,081
Remember, go against
your instinct

619
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,582
and do not breathe in.

620
00:23:18,584 --> 00:23:20,584
Okay.
I will come back for you.

621
00:23:20,586 --> 00:23:22,786
I promise.

622
00:23:46,471 --> 00:23:48,271
How long has it been?

623
00:23:48,273 --> 00:23:50,106
Too long.

624
00:23:50,108 --> 00:23:51,875
After going underground
in an incredible attempt

625
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:55,545
to keep Owen Cooper alive,
everyone is waiting, praying,

626
00:23:55,547 --> 00:23:57,981
for heroic civilian
Walter O'Brien to emerge

627
00:23:57,983 --> 00:24:00,884
from the tunnel with news
of the child's condition.

628
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:04,154
There he is!

629
00:24:04,156 --> 00:24:05,855
Are you okay?

630
00:24:05,857 --> 00:24:07,757
Has he signaled yet?

631
00:24:09,161 --> 00:24:10,560
I got a cop

632
00:24:10,562 --> 00:24:13,196
waiting in the cave
by the PVC, but nothing yet.

633
00:24:13,198 --> 00:24:15,298
We're coming up
on half a minute.

634
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,234
Come on, Owen. Okay.

635
00:24:18,236 --> 00:24:20,570
This is Gallo. Anything?

636
00:24:20,572 --> 00:24:22,472
Negative. Still no signal.

637
00:24:22,474 --> 00:24:24,107
We're at 40 seconds.

638
00:24:26,611 --> 00:24:28,211
Look at me.

639
00:24:29,948 --> 00:24:32,782
Don't blame yourself.

640
00:24:36,321 --> 00:24:38,321
Agent Gallo. You copy?

641
00:24:38,323 --> 00:24:39,756
What do you got?

642
00:24:39,758 --> 00:24:42,058
Three loud knocks, sir.
Clear as day.

643
00:24:44,496 --> 00:24:46,696
Give me that.
Give me the phone.

644
00:24:51,069 --> 00:24:52,502
Happy.

645
00:24:52,504 --> 00:24:53,937
Now, Owen is doing his best
to survive,

646
00:24:53,939 --> 00:24:55,805
but we still need that jack.
How much longer?

647
00:24:55,807 --> 00:24:58,608
I'm almost done. Then another
15 minutes to get to you.

648
00:24:58,610 --> 00:24:59,642
That's at least 20 minutes.

649
00:24:59,644 --> 00:25:01,277
Not for us. We called LAPD.

650
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,513
Police escort, baby.
Oh, good thinking.

651
00:25:03,515 --> 00:25:05,748
But hurry.

652
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,618
Okay, two minutes,
gold melts, and I mold it

653
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,653
into a thrust bearing,
and we are done.

654
00:25:13,491 --> 00:25:15,158
Happy, what's this?

655
00:25:18,763 --> 00:25:20,029
Don't look through
my things.

656
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:21,497
You tracked down your father?

657
00:25:23,335 --> 00:25:26,102
In 100 seconds,
the gold's ready.

658
00:25:26,104 --> 00:25:28,438
So, over a minute to talk about
something very important.

659
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,873
It's not a big deal.
I've been wrenching

660
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,374
at his body shop
for the last few weeks,

661
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:32,508
that's all.

662
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:35,111
He's a mechanic.
I love genetics.

663
00:25:35,113 --> 00:25:36,179
Good for you.

664
00:25:36,181 --> 00:25:37,780
What was his reaction?

665
00:25:38,984 --> 00:25:40,783
You didn't tell him who you are.

666
00:25:40,785 --> 00:25:42,352
That is what the card is for,

667
00:25:42,354 --> 00:25:44,454
but I can't
seem to give it to him.

668
00:25:44,456 --> 00:25:46,155
Happy, you clearly
want to tell him.

669
00:25:46,157 --> 00:25:47,757
The card was a mistake.

670
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:49,492
“There are no mistakes.”
Richard Bach.

671
00:25:49,494 --> 00:25:51,728
“Get out of my face.”
Happy Quinn.

672
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:52,929
I will.
But consider this.

673
00:25:52,931 --> 00:25:55,164
There are two parents
racing like hell right now

674
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:57,033
to get to a little boy
trapped in a sinkhole.

675
00:25:57,035 --> 00:25:59,168
And all three
want the same thing:

676
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,670
to be with family on Christmas.

677
00:26:00,672 --> 00:26:04,007
You have that shot, and you're
forsaking it over fear.

678
00:26:08,914 --> 00:26:11,514
Gold's done. Get the mold.

679
00:26:11,516 --> 00:26:15,418
Why are you here
instead of with your team?

680
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,054
I'm leaving.

681
00:26:18,056 --> 00:26:20,156
Because you made
some miscalculations?

682
00:26:20,158 --> 00:26:23,793
That child is living
my worst nightmares.

683
00:26:23,795 --> 00:26:25,495
Claustrophobia--

684
00:26:25,497 --> 00:26:27,330
fear of tight spaces.
Aquaphobia--

685
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:29,065
fear of water.
Achluophobia--

686
00:26:29,067 --> 00:26:30,166
fear of darkness.

687
00:26:30,168 --> 00:26:32,268
Taphophobia--
fear of being buried alive.

688
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,137
When I was on that
beach, I felt like

689
00:26:34,139 --> 00:26:35,371
I was in there with him.

690
00:26:35,373 --> 00:26:36,673
I couldn't concentrate,
I couldn't calculate.

691
00:26:36,675 --> 00:26:39,175
I am useless to Scorpion.

692
00:26:39,177 --> 00:26:42,211
Shut up. You felt like
you were down there?

693
00:26:42,213 --> 00:26:44,047
He<i> is</i> down there.

694
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:46,115
My God, Sylvester,

695
00:26:46,117 --> 00:26:48,985
how do you live when you're
constantly scared of death?

696
00:26:48,987 --> 00:26:51,554
You want to go?

697
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:53,456
Go.

698
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:55,625
But you'll have to live with
what happens to Owen,

699
00:26:55,627 --> 00:26:57,293
knowing you could've helped.

700
00:26:58,797 --> 00:27:00,129
Or you could
stay strong for him.

701
00:27:00,131 --> 00:27:02,332
Stay strong.

702
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:05,935
I've never been strong.

703
00:27:07,639 --> 00:27:12,308
Well, that's a “you” problem,
so figure it out.

704
00:27:20,085 --> 00:27:21,085
Faster, Grandma!

705
00:27:21,086 --> 00:27:22,385
I'm right on his bumper!

706
00:27:22,387 --> 00:27:24,220
I should have driven.
I have seen you drive.

707
00:27:24,222 --> 00:27:25,822
We can't save Owen
if we're both dead.

708
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,789
Hold on,

709
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:28,091
what the hell's this?!

710
00:27:30,495 --> 00:27:31,794
Hey, what's going on?

711
00:27:31,796 --> 00:27:32,929
There's a truck accident
up ahead.

712
00:27:32,931 --> 00:27:34,464
I'll see if I can
clear the holdup.

713
00:27:34,466 --> 00:27:36,766
We don't have that kind of time.
Toby, get us out of here.

714
00:27:36,768 --> 00:27:38,835
I'm driving a Monte Carlo--
it's not like I can split lanes.

715
00:27:38,837 --> 00:27:41,571
No. But Santa can.

716
00:27:41,573 --> 00:27:43,139
Hey.

717
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:45,108
I know this sounds
crazy, but have you seen

718
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,843
the kid in the news,
the one stuck in a hole?

719
00:27:46,845 --> 00:27:48,745
Heard about it.
We're working on the case,

720
00:27:48,747 --> 00:27:50,847
and that boy needs you to
give us your motorcycle.

721
00:27:50,849 --> 00:27:52,015
No time to explain.

722
00:27:52,017 --> 00:27:54,150
Get lost.
When you remember me,

723
00:27:54,152 --> 00:27:55,685
remember me fondly.

724
00:27:57,789 --> 00:27:59,422
Happy!

725
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,693
Oh, my spleen.

726
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:06,796
Get on!

727
00:28:07,766 --> 00:28:09,332
I'm so sorry.

728
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:14,737
O2 levels are steady.

729
00:28:14,739 --> 00:28:16,672
He's not panicking;
this kid's amazing.

730
00:28:16,674 --> 00:28:17,840
Do you know what the odds were

731
00:28:17,842 --> 00:28:19,242
of that weak tunnel
collapsing on you?

732
00:28:19,244 --> 00:28:22,011
42%. Which is a 58%
chance of survival.

733
00:28:22,013 --> 00:28:23,980
The odds are on my side.
Do the math

734
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:26,749
all you want, but there's
a boy breathing underwater,

735
00:28:26,751 --> 00:28:27,884
still alive.

736
00:28:27,886 --> 00:28:29,452
That's a miracle in my book.

737
00:28:30,522 --> 00:28:31,788
Another rock slide!

738
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,723
Get out of here
before it caves in!

739
00:28:36,127 --> 00:28:38,761
Come on!

740
00:28:38,763 --> 00:28:40,396
This part of the ceiling's
about to collapse.

741
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:43,099
Then the ECMO goes down,
then Owen is dead.

742
00:28:43,101 --> 00:28:44,500
If that rock falls on you,
you're dead!

743
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,370
Move the ECMO!

744
00:28:47,372 --> 00:28:49,072
Took four people
to get it in here!

745
00:28:49,074 --> 00:28:50,273
The slide's calmed down.

746
00:28:50,275 --> 00:28:52,375
Now get out of here
before that rock falls on you!

747
00:28:52,377 --> 00:28:54,977
Not until you move the ECMO!
I'll get help!

748
00:28:54,979 --> 00:28:57,713
I got it.
No, Sylvester.

749
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,016
Sylvester!
I got it.

750
00:29:00,018 --> 00:29:01,684
You sure?

751
00:29:01,686 --> 00:29:04,353
I got it!
All right. Okay.

752
00:29:07,192 --> 00:29:09,192
No, we can't wait
until the others get here.

753
00:29:09,194 --> 00:29:10,326
We got to move now.

754
00:29:10,328 --> 00:29:11,861
We got to move it,
come on.

755
00:29:11,863 --> 00:29:13,062
Come on!

756
00:29:13,064 --> 00:29:16,199
All right,
one, two, three.

757
00:29:20,438 --> 00:29:21,938
I can't hold it much longer!

758
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,780
Sylvester, it's breaking off.
Get out of there.

759
00:29:31,282 --> 00:29:32,548
You okay, pal?

760
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,016
Walter, we got
a problem.

761
00:29:34,018 --> 00:29:35,485
I'm okay.

762
00:29:38,056 --> 00:29:40,289
Oh, God. The rocks

763
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:42,125
pinched off the tubes.

764
00:29:43,161 --> 00:29:45,361
The tubing's blocked.
He can't get oxygen.

765
00:29:47,632 --> 00:29:49,899
He's dying.

766
00:29:53,064 --> 00:29:55,746
Now get your men to that
cavern and move that rock!

767
00:29:55,747 --> 00:29:57,714
What, get equipment over
those boulders, in the surf,

768
00:29:57,716 --> 00:29:59,049
with tide coming in?
Yes!

769
00:29:59,051 --> 00:30:00,917
It would take an hour.
He's suffocating down there!

770
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:02,519
<i>With oxygen cut off</i>

771
00:30:02,521 --> 00:30:04,154
to young Owen Cooper, he is just

772
00:30:04,156 --> 00:30:07,023
minutes now from total loss
of brain function.

773
00:30:07,025 --> 00:30:09,259
I'm getting him out.
Son, his leg is trapped.

774
00:30:09,261 --> 00:30:11,094
There's no way.
I can't let him die in there.

775
00:30:11,096 --> 00:30:12,395
Son.
Walter!

776
00:30:12,397 --> 00:30:13,597
Listen. Son!

777
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:15,665
Get off of me!
Get off me!

778
00:30:15,667 --> 00:30:18,168
He's been underwater
for three minutes!

779
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:20,070
He's only got
one functioning lung!

780
00:30:46,372 --> 00:30:48,005
I don't have a
motorcycle license.

781
00:30:48,007 --> 00:30:48,872
Great news.

782
00:30:48,874 --> 00:30:50,074
Stop crying.

783
00:30:50,076 --> 00:30:52,743
We're only 300 yards
from the beach.

784
00:30:59,018 --> 00:31:01,118
Whoa.

785
00:31:05,257 --> 00:31:08,025
You got to be kidding.
We're out of gas!

786
00:31:08,027 --> 00:31:09,560
You know what, give
me that knapsack.

787
00:31:09,562 --> 00:31:11,195
I spent my childhood
sprinting from bullies.

788
00:31:11,197 --> 00:31:13,730
It's about to pay off.

789
00:31:17,069 --> 00:31:21,772
I promised him
I'd come back for him.

790
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,615
Walter!

791
00:31:33,617 --> 00:31:37,393
We got it!

792
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:45,395
Got it!

793
00:31:45,929 --> 00:31:47,495
You're about to risk
your life again,

794
00:31:47,497 --> 00:31:50,930
when the likelihood that
Owen's still alive after

795
00:31:50,932 --> 00:31:52,765
We've seen worse odds.
No, we have not.

796
00:31:52,767 --> 00:31:54,967
It's not possible.
Cabe's right. The water

797
00:31:54,969 --> 00:31:56,936
isn't nearly cold enough
to put that kid in a full

798
00:31:56,938 --> 00:31:58,838
hypothermic state where
he might survive that long.

799
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,739
I know.
And the brain without oxygen

800
00:32:00,741 --> 00:32:02,575
begins to die after five minutes.
I know!

801
00:32:02,577 --> 00:32:04,376
I really don't
want you to do this.

802
00:32:04,378 --> 00:32:06,612
I know.

803
00:32:06,614 --> 00:32:08,614
The last rock slide completely
compromised the tunnel,

804
00:32:08,616 --> 00:32:09,949
which was unstable
to begin with.

805
00:32:09,951 --> 00:32:12,218
Anyone who goes down there
risks being buried alive.

806
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,152
He knows.
He knows.

807
00:32:13,154 --> 00:32:14,653
Son, why are you doing this?

808
00:32:14,655 --> 00:32:16,589
I made a promise
I'd come back for him.

809
00:32:16,591 --> 00:32:17,990
Are you scared?

810
00:32:17,992 --> 00:32:20,025
Yes.
Good.

811
00:32:20,027 --> 00:32:21,460
That means you'll be careful.

812
00:32:27,301 --> 00:32:29,802
<i> Walter O'Brien, some</i>
<i>type of government contractor,</i>

813
00:32:29,804 --> 00:32:31,237
<i>is underground,</i>

814
00:32:31,239 --> 00:32:34,273
trying to extract Owen Cooper,
who has now been without air

815
00:32:34,275 --> 00:32:37,209
<i>for almost six-and-a-half</i>
<i>minutes.</i>

816
00:32:56,197 --> 00:32:57,296
Okay.

817
00:32:57,298 --> 00:32:58,998
All right.

818
00:33:28,562 --> 00:33:31,196
Hold on!

819
00:33:32,066 --> 00:33:33,799
Collapsing!

820
00:33:53,123 --> 00:33:54,923
Walter!

821
00:33:54,925 --> 00:33:56,424
Cabe!
Grab my hand!

822
00:33:57,627 --> 00:33:58,827
Got him!

823
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:02,330
<i> Here on the beach,</i>
<i>on Christmas Eve,</i>

824
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:03,798
strangers are coming together

825
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,001
<i>to save a child.</i>

826
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:07,135
We got him!

827
00:34:10,307 --> 00:34:12,140
Clear the way!

828
00:35:11,031 --> 00:35:13,899
<i> It's being hailed</i>
<i>a Christmas miracle.</i>

829
00:35:13,901 --> 00:35:16,468
<i>Doctors say a boy survived</i>
<i>after being underwater</i>

830
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:19,170
<i>without oxygen</i>
<i>for over seven minutes,</i>

831
00:35:19,172 --> 00:35:21,645
<i>and is expected</i>
<i>to make a full recovery.</i>

832
00:35:21,669 --> 00:35:23,435
We're at St. Stephen's Hospital

833
00:35:23,436 --> 00:35:25,370
waiting to hear
from Walter O'Brien,

834
00:35:25,394 --> 00:35:27,740
the head of the team
that saved Owen Cooper.

835
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:32,520
It is hoped that someone with
a 197 IQ can shed some light

836
00:35:32,521 --> 00:35:34,878
on what exactly happened
in that hole today.

837
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,646
Miracle?

838
00:35:36,648 --> 00:35:38,714
It's more like the ECMO
artificially pumped up

839
00:35:38,716 --> 00:35:40,082
his O2 levels
high enough that

840
00:35:40,084 --> 00:35:42,418
his organs kept going
a few minutes longer than usual.

841
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,787
It's a million-to-one shot,
but not a miracle.

842
00:35:46,057 --> 00:35:48,591
Press is not gonna like it
when I give them that story.

843
00:35:48,593 --> 00:35:49,692
Guys.

844
00:35:49,694 --> 00:35:52,061
Some people really want
to see you.

845
00:35:56,134 --> 00:35:59,135
Hey.

846
00:36:00,672 --> 00:36:02,304
Thank you, Walter.

847
00:36:02,306 --> 00:36:03,406
What for?

848
00:36:03,408 --> 00:36:05,975
For allowing me
to believe again.

849
00:36:07,412 --> 00:36:09,912
If you trust that drug trial,
I do, too.

850
00:36:11,182 --> 00:36:12,648
I'll do it.

851
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:14,483
I'm gonna keep fighting.

852
00:36:17,822 --> 00:36:19,488
Guys.

853
00:36:33,237 --> 00:36:35,604
The entire drive down,
we prayed.

854
00:36:35,606 --> 00:36:38,874
We prayed for God
to do something,

855
00:36:38,876 --> 00:36:41,844
anything... to save our child.

856
00:36:43,181 --> 00:36:45,114
He answered by sending you.

857
00:36:46,684 --> 00:36:48,350
And your team.

858
00:36:50,888 --> 00:36:52,455
Thank you.

859
00:37:20,118 --> 00:37:22,184
You came back for me.

860
00:37:22,186 --> 00:37:24,987
Oh, I told you,
I only state facts.

861
00:37:29,727 --> 00:37:32,161
We should let these
folks get some rest.

862
00:37:32,163 --> 00:37:34,463
Come on, guys.

863
00:37:42,406 --> 00:37:45,608
I've got an entire press
corp calling for you to explain

864
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:47,543
how this little boy lived.

865
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,946
Do you want to talk
to them or not?

866
00:38:01,692 --> 00:38:03,692
Ah, they already have
their answer.

867
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:09,064
It was a miracle.

868
00:38:21,045 --> 00:38:22,578
Hey.

869
00:38:23,414 --> 00:38:25,214
Hey, Happy!

870
00:38:25,216 --> 00:38:28,050
What are you doing here
on Christmas Eve?

871
00:38:36,294 --> 00:38:39,228
I wanted to, um...

872
00:38:42,266 --> 00:38:43,899
You okay?
Yeah.

873
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:47,436
I just, I wanted to wish you
a happy holiday.

874
00:38:47,438 --> 00:38:49,071
I'll see you later.

875
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:55,511
You look just like her.

876
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,622
I knew who you were the first
time you walked into my shop.

877
00:39:06,624 --> 00:39:09,592
After your mother died,
I was lost,

878
00:39:09,594 --> 00:39:11,894
and I hit the bottle, hard.

879
00:39:11,896 --> 00:39:13,562
Still do.

880
00:39:13,564 --> 00:39:16,866
You were so special.

881
00:39:16,868 --> 00:39:18,801
Deserved better than me.

882
00:39:22,807 --> 00:39:25,207
I always loved you.

883
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,158
Hey, everyone.

884
00:39:44,962 --> 00:39:48,297
Uh, this is...
my dad, Patrick.

885
00:39:48,299 --> 00:39:49,531
Hello.

886
00:39:49,533 --> 00:39:51,000
Hi.
Hi.

887
00:39:51,002 --> 00:39:53,369
Welcome, Mr. Quinn.

888
00:39:53,371 --> 00:39:54,637
You got a great girl there.

889
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:57,006
It's a real pleasure
to meet you.

890
00:40:03,481 --> 00:40:04,947
Oh, yeah!

891
00:40:04,949 --> 00:40:07,349
That's nice.

892
00:40:08,286 --> 00:40:10,552
Who brought me a gift?

893
00:40:13,424 --> 00:40:14,823
Okay. Touchdown.

894
00:40:14,825 --> 00:40:17,326
Oh, you got
your hat back.

895
00:40:17,328 --> 00:40:18,894
I'm back.

896
00:40:18,896 --> 00:40:21,263
Huh?
Look at this.

897
00:40:21,265 --> 00:40:23,165
This is awesome.

898
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:24,934
That's very nice of you.

899
00:40:38,816 --> 00:40:40,849
It's silly.

900
00:40:40,851 --> 00:40:43,953
You need a little silly
in your life.

901
00:40:50,394 --> 00:40:51,894
Look at that!

902
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,732
Hey, guys, we got

903
00:40:56,734 --> 00:40:58,233
Ralph's present
in the next room.

904
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:03,539
Okay, so...
we made all this for you, pal.

905
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:05,941
All right, press the button.

906
00:41:44,248 --> 00:41:47,416
Oh! Do you see that?

907
00:41:50,788 --> 00:41:52,254
It's amazing!

908
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:11,874
What?

909
00:42:11,876 --> 00:42:14,543
Nothing. Just, um...

910
00:42:14,545 --> 00:42:16,578
merry Christmas.

911
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,747
Merry Christmas.
