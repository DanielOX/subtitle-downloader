1
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:06,734
<i>My name is Walter O'Brien.</i>

2
00:00:07,118 --> 00:00:11,487
<i>I have the fourth highest IQ</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

3
00:00:11,489 --> 00:00:13,189
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

4
00:00:13,191 --> 00:00:15,825
<i>When I was 11, the FBI</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking NASA</i>

5
00:00:15,827 --> 00:00:18,494
<i>to get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

6
00:00:18,496 --> 00:00:20,630
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

7
00:00:20,632 --> 00:00:23,666
<i>tackling worldwide threats</i>
<i>only we can solve.</i>

8
00:00:23,668 --> 00:00:25,434
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

9
00:00:25,436 --> 00:00:27,170
<i>Sylvester's a human calculator.</i>

10
00:00:27,172 --> 00:00:29,505
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

11
00:00:29,507 --> 00:00:31,774
<i>Agent Cabe Gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

12
00:00:31,776 --> 00:00:34,010
<i>And Paige?</i>
<i>Well, Paige isn't like us.</i>

13
00:00:34,012 --> 00:00:36,479
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

14
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:39,148
<i>while we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

15
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,250
<i>Together, we are Scorpion.</i>

16
00:00:56,267 --> 00:00:58,267
Did you hear that?

17
00:00:58,269 --> 00:00:59,936
Nothing to hear,
Octavio.

18
00:00:59,938 --> 00:01:03,105
Transport isn't due for an hour.
Settle down.

19
00:01:04,842 --> 00:01:07,410
You haven't seen what they do
to people like me.

20
00:01:07,412 --> 00:01:09,579
Two years we've been working
to take down the cartel.

21
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:11,047
We've seen plenty.

22
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:12,648
I swear I hear something.

23
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,917
There's no place more secure

24
00:01:14,919 --> 00:01:18,421
than this middle-of-nowhere
desert dump, Octavio.

25
00:01:19,324 --> 00:01:22,058
Guaranteed by
the U.S. government.

26
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,960
We are alone.

27
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:49,151
Ralph?

28
00:01:52,423 --> 00:01:55,424
It's 2:00 in
the morning.

29
00:01:56,494 --> 00:01:59,161
And you're supposed to ask
to use my laptop, buddy.

30
00:01:59,163 --> 00:02:01,197
My game got weird.

31
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:03,232
I unlocked a hidden level.

32
00:02:03,234 --> 00:02:05,501
It took me someplace.

33
00:02:05,503 --> 00:02:07,470
But there was no one there.

34
00:02:07,472 --> 00:02:09,472
What game is this?
A new one.

35
00:02:09,474 --> 00:02:11,607
Online.

36
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:13,943
You know we don't play games
I don't approve of first.

37
00:02:13,945 --> 00:02:15,678
Right? Sleep.

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,113
Now.

39
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:32,061
You're late.

40
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:34,463
You don't speed when you're
hauling this kind of load.

41
00:02:34,465 --> 00:02:36,499
Got to ask, is this
thing radioactive?

42
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:38,467
Shouldn't be.

43
00:02:40,938 --> 00:02:44,073
♪ ♪

44
00:03:01,826 --> 00:03:03,993
Hey, go grab that shadow
box for your show-and-tell.

45
00:03:03,995 --> 00:03:05,661
I'll make you a quick
breakfast. Five minutes.

46
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:08,264
What's Walter working on?
I don't know.

47
00:03:12,303 --> 00:03:14,203
What's that?

48
00:03:14,205 --> 00:03:16,539
It's a booster
decoupler.

49
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,940
For what?

50
00:03:19,077 --> 00:03:20,242
Wow!

51
00:03:20,244 --> 00:03:21,811
“Wow” what?

52
00:03:21,813 --> 00:03:23,813
What's he up to?

53
00:03:23,815 --> 00:03:25,681
No idea.

54
00:03:25,683 --> 00:03:28,351
So...

55
00:03:28,353 --> 00:03:29,919
what are we doing?

56
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:31,187
Ah-ah! Reactor core.

57
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:33,856
Please do not
touch that.

58
00:03:33,858 --> 00:03:37,393
Am I looking at
a dismantled CL-450?

59
00:03:37,395 --> 00:03:39,962
It's a CL-460.

60
00:03:39,964 --> 00:03:41,130
Polish this for me?

61
00:03:41,132 --> 00:03:43,332
Oh, she can polish
the reactor core,

62
00:03:43,334 --> 00:03:44,734
I'm Lord Numbnuts.

63
00:03:44,736 --> 00:03:46,769
You're no good
with your hands.

64
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:48,137
You're a spiller.

65
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:49,839
Am I?

66
00:03:51,843 --> 00:03:52,843
Toby!

67
00:03:52,844 --> 00:03:53,909
Yeah, numbnuts,
yeah, mm-hmm.

68
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:55,211
Whoa.

69
00:03:55,213 --> 00:03:57,980
Why don't you go do
a psych eval on the coffee pot?

70
00:03:59,384 --> 00:04:00,683
Where is the Olds?

71
00:04:00,685 --> 00:04:02,551
I was gonna use that
as a make-out hut.

72
00:04:02,553 --> 00:04:04,787
With who?
A lucky lady.

73
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,992
Whoa, Walter!

74
00:04:09,994 --> 00:04:11,427
What is this?
You're building a spaceship?

75
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:12,561
Hold on, hold on.

76
00:04:12,563 --> 00:04:15,331
I'm studying
jet propulsion.

77
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,966
For the Karman Line Prize.

78
00:04:16,968 --> 00:04:18,634
It was announced
last week.

79
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:22,238
An anonymous billionaire
is awarding $15 million

80
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,607
for significant aerospace
advancement.

81
00:04:24,609 --> 00:04:27,810
Just imagine what I could do
for Megan's MS for $15 million.

82
00:04:31,182 --> 00:04:32,715
Hey, Walt, can I get a sec?

83
00:04:37,288 --> 00:04:39,221
There's a lot of ways
to make money.

84
00:04:39,223 --> 00:04:40,790
That much at once?

85
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:42,124
It's a short list.

86
00:04:42,126 --> 00:04:44,026
And I don't have
an oil well.

87
00:04:44,028 --> 00:04:45,861
Whoa, a rocket.

88
00:04:45,863 --> 00:04:47,596
When we're done
with the reactor core,

89
00:04:47,598 --> 00:04:49,131
can we repair the control drum?

90
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:52,234
We probably need to get the
rust off the turbo pumps.

91
00:04:52,236 --> 00:04:53,702
Maybe a vinegar bath.

92
00:04:53,704 --> 00:04:56,038
I should skip school
until this is done.

93
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,273
Nope. We're leaving.

94
00:04:57,275 --> 00:04:58,674
Now. In the car.

95
00:05:03,448 --> 00:05:04,713
You sure this is about Megan?

96
00:05:04,715 --> 00:05:05,981
'Cause Ralph is
certainly hooked.

97
00:05:05,983 --> 00:05:08,150
You're reaching for something.
What?

98
00:05:08,152 --> 00:05:12,121
Just pretty cool project,
building a rocket ship.

99
00:05:12,123 --> 00:05:14,123
What little boy
doesn't dream of that?

100
00:05:18,362 --> 00:05:19,628
Your dad's back
from Portland.

101
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,230
He's gonna pick you
up after school

102
00:05:21,232 --> 00:05:22,498
and take you
for a milkshake.

103
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,732
I'd rather work
on the rocket.

104
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:25,134
Well, he's looking
forward to it.

105
00:05:25,136 --> 00:05:27,036
He said he
got you a hat.

106
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:29,839
But I'd rather work
on the rocket.

107
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:32,074
The plans are set.
No more tug-of-war.

108
00:05:32,076 --> 00:05:33,175
Come on.

109
00:05:37,715 --> 00:05:39,715
Ralph, come here.

110
00:05:39,717 --> 00:05:40,717
Paige Dineen.

111
00:05:40,718 --> 00:05:42,485
Agent Wilson Eckherd,

112
00:05:42,487 --> 00:05:44,220
Department of Justice.

113
00:05:44,222 --> 00:05:46,255
This is Ralph?
What do you want?

114
00:05:46,257 --> 00:05:48,424
You need to come with us,
both of you.

115
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:50,025
It concerns
national security.

116
00:05:50,027 --> 00:05:51,193
What did I do?

117
00:05:51,195 --> 00:05:53,496
It's not you, ma'am,
it's your son.

118
00:05:53,498 --> 00:05:55,297
Let's go, come on.
Uh, okay.

119
00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:57,733
Hold on.

120
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,571
Mom, am I
going to jail?

121
00:06:02,573 --> 00:06:04,440
Of course not.

122
00:06:04,442 --> 00:06:06,442
I am sure it's a mix-up.

123
00:06:06,444 --> 00:06:07,643
Miss Dineen.

124
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,980
I'm not leaving my son alone.

125
00:06:10,982 --> 00:06:13,315
My office is right
on the other side of that glass.

126
00:06:13,317 --> 00:06:14,917
And you don't really
have a choice.

127
00:06:16,621 --> 00:06:18,587
I'll be right in there.

128
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:20,789
Okay.

129
00:06:26,764 --> 00:06:28,464
What the hell is going on?

130
00:06:31,135 --> 00:06:33,669
Oh, my God.

131
00:06:33,671 --> 00:06:36,572
Agents Daniel Cullens and Kate
Stellan were killed last night

132
00:06:36,574 --> 00:06:39,074
in a CIA safe house
in Culiacan, Mexico.

133
00:06:39,076 --> 00:06:40,809
They were guarding
a turncoat captain

134
00:06:40,811 --> 00:06:42,311
in the Jotas
drug cartel.

135
00:06:42,313 --> 00:06:44,413
What does this
have to do with Ralph?

136
00:06:44,415 --> 00:06:47,483
The location and layout of
the safe house were leaked

137
00:06:47,485 --> 00:06:49,852
as a secret level of
a game posted online.

138
00:06:49,854 --> 00:06:51,954
Again, how does this
concern Ralph?

139
00:06:51,956 --> 00:06:54,156
Thousands of people
played this game,

140
00:06:54,158 --> 00:06:56,458
but only two parties found
the secret level

141
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,961
and decrypted
the safe house information--

142
00:06:58,963 --> 00:07:01,330
the drug cartel who murdered
our agents and Ralph.

143
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,300
So it's something
he stumbled on.

144
00:07:04,302 --> 00:07:07,670
Ralph was in a map ten
encryptions deep into this game,

145
00:07:07,672 --> 00:07:10,005
something that would take a good
hacker months to accomplish.

146
00:07:10,007 --> 00:07:11,373
He couldn't have
just stumbled on it.

147
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,608
The issue is

148
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,010
the safe house information
was classified CIA Intel.

149
00:07:15,012 --> 00:07:18,113
Our concern is that Ralph may
have helped design the game

150
00:07:18,115 --> 00:07:19,515
that delivered it
to the cartel.

151
00:07:19,517 --> 00:07:21,817
How on earth would he have
access to CIA intelligence?

152
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:23,986
You work for a
government contractor.

153
00:07:23,988 --> 00:07:26,355
Your team has specialized
expert hackers.

154
00:07:26,357 --> 00:07:28,357
None of them would
allow him to do this.

155
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:30,292
Scorpion does nothing
but help people.

156
00:07:30,294 --> 00:07:32,227
Miss Dineen, we don't
grab children randomly

157
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:33,662
off the street.

158
00:07:33,664 --> 00:07:36,699
Either he knew where the secret
map was and how to access it,

159
00:07:36,701 --> 00:07:39,168
or had something to do with
the design of this game.

160
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,471
Which disseminated
CIA intelligence, okay.

161
00:07:42,473 --> 00:07:44,840
This is a very,
very serious situation.

162
00:07:44,842 --> 00:07:46,842
I need to speak
with Ralph.

163
00:07:46,844 --> 00:07:49,478
You can be watching
from right next door.

164
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,647
I need to speak
with Walter O'Brien

165
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:53,849
and Agent Cabe Gallo
from Homeland.

166
00:07:58,456 --> 00:08:00,522
This is your mom's
laptop, Ralph.

167
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,327
That game you were
playing,<i> Overt Target,</i>

168
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:07,329
where did you find it?

169
00:08:07,331 --> 00:08:09,565
Playing around.

170
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:11,567
You know what
a dark Web site is?

171
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:14,503
They're inaccessible
to normal search engines.

172
00:08:14,505 --> 00:08:17,940
You don't just play around
and find them.

173
00:08:17,942 --> 00:08:20,409
And<i> Overt Target</i>
was in the dark Web.

174
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:25,247
I know you're
a-a smart boy.

175
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:26,448
Genius.

176
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,816
So you need to know that

177
00:08:27,818 --> 00:08:30,519
when my forensic team goes
through your mom's computer,

178
00:08:30,521 --> 00:08:31,854
they're gonna
find everything--

179
00:08:31,856 --> 00:08:34,123
every game you played,
how you got there,

180
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,691
who you chatted with.

181
00:08:38,663 --> 00:08:41,096
How did you find the secret
level, the safe house level?

182
00:08:41,098 --> 00:08:42,731
I just found it.

183
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:44,466
No. No, that's
impossible.

184
00:08:44,468 --> 00:08:48,270
Did you have anything to do
with the design of this game?

185
00:08:48,272 --> 00:08:49,705
No.

186
00:08:49,707 --> 00:08:52,007
Do you know who
created the game?

187
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:55,577
How did you find the dark site
where it was posted?

188
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:56,812
And do not tell me

189
00:08:56,814 --> 00:08:58,414
that you just found it.

190
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,183
Walter showed it to me.

191
00:09:01,185 --> 00:09:03,285
Walter?

192
00:09:03,287 --> 00:09:06,321
Walter O'Brien?

193
00:09:07,725 --> 00:09:10,392
And he taught me decryption.

194
00:09:10,394 --> 00:09:12,194
I didn't know it was bad.

195
00:09:12,196 --> 00:09:13,896
This is over now.

196
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,400
Agent Gallo,
Homeland Security.

197
00:09:18,402 --> 00:09:20,903
What did you teach him?

198
00:09:28,446 --> 00:09:30,579
So these dark sites,

199
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:33,348
it's where the most interesting
coding is; it-it's cutting edge.

200
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,483
Walter.

201
00:09:34,485 --> 00:09:36,485
I thought it would be
interesting for Ralph to see

202
00:09:36,487 --> 00:09:38,587
where the smartest people
on the Web are designing.

203
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:39,988
And doing what else?

204
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,323
Did you think of that?

205
00:09:41,325 --> 00:09:44,893
I was just showing him
a beta game site.

206
00:09:44,895 --> 00:09:46,929
People post for feedback
to drum up buzz

207
00:09:46,931 --> 00:09:48,197
before selling to big companies.

208
00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:50,499
You get to see the game
years before anyone else does.

209
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:51,934
Stop. Now.

210
00:09:51,936 --> 00:09:54,470
Got here as
quick as I could.

211
00:09:54,472 --> 00:09:56,972
Hey, buddy.

212
00:09:56,974 --> 00:09:58,373
Scary day, huh?

213
00:09:59,443 --> 00:10:00,876
Somebody want to fill me in?

214
00:10:00,878 --> 00:10:02,244
It's nothing, he did nothing.

215
00:10:02,246 --> 00:10:04,146
But he got hauled
off the street

216
00:10:04,148 --> 00:10:06,508
in front of his school, and
we're at the Justice Department.

217
00:10:07,184 --> 00:10:09,384
Can you sit with Ralph?

218
00:10:09,386 --> 00:10:10,953
Yeah.

219
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,224
Hey.

220
00:10:15,226 --> 00:10:17,826
You want to tell me
what happened?

221
00:10:17,828 --> 00:10:20,095
I just want to
talk to Walter.

222
00:10:21,932 --> 00:10:23,599
Okay.

223
00:10:25,302 --> 00:10:28,771
Eckherd's not buying him just
stumbling into the secret level.

224
00:10:28,773 --> 00:10:30,773
That is the likely scenario.
He just can't comprehend

225
00:10:30,775 --> 00:10:32,741
the depth of Ralph's
intelligence; maybe no one can.

226
00:10:32,743 --> 00:10:34,943
They should be talking
to Walter. Why aren't they?

227
00:10:34,945 --> 00:10:36,612
I can explain everything.
Not now.

228
00:10:36,614 --> 00:10:38,046
I've lawyered up
for the whole team.

229
00:10:38,048 --> 00:10:39,948
In the meantime, Ralph's being
released back to you.

230
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,383
Thank God.

231
00:10:41,385 --> 00:10:43,786
But he's my responsibility, so
you need to stay close to me

232
00:10:43,788 --> 00:10:45,654
in case Eckherd wants
him to come back in.

233
00:10:45,656 --> 00:10:48,190
Cabe, let me talk to them
and clear this up.

234
00:10:48,192 --> 00:10:49,691
They're being
extremely aggressive.

235
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:51,894
The safe house Intel in the
game was stolen in a hack

236
00:10:51,896 --> 00:10:54,129
of the CIA mainframe
three weeks ago.

237
00:10:54,131 --> 00:10:56,231
Details from six other
unknown operations

238
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:58,100
and safe houses
were taken.

239
00:10:58,102 --> 00:11:00,602
Ralph had nothing to do
with hacking the CIA.

240
00:11:00,604 --> 00:11:02,271
I know.

241
00:11:02,273 --> 00:11:03,505
But they don't.

242
00:11:03,507 --> 00:11:05,774
Okay, so we need to find out
who hacked the CIA.

243
00:11:05,776 --> 00:11:07,709
That's who likely put
the information in the game.

244
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:08,844
Why are we standing here?

245
00:11:08,846 --> 00:11:10,179
Hey.

246
00:11:10,181 --> 00:11:12,247
Fill me in.

247
00:11:12,249 --> 00:11:13,215
There's no time.

248
00:11:13,217 --> 00:11:15,017
He's my son. Make time.

249
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:19,121
You know, with your history,
I would be cautious saying that.

250
00:11:19,123 --> 00:11:21,757
This is not
about either of you.

251
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:23,559
This is a mess you got
Ralph into, and you need

252
00:11:23,561 --> 00:11:24,893
to get him out. Do
you understand that?

253
00:11:24,895 --> 00:11:26,929
I will make this right.
Stop talking

254
00:11:26,931 --> 00:11:28,197
and just do it.

255
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:36,891

Where are we?

258
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:54,665
Walter, are you okay?
Where's Ralph?

259
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:57,267
Coming with
Cabe, Paige and Drew.

260
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:58,769
What's our progress
tracking the developer

261
00:11:58,771 --> 00:12:00,938
of the<i> Overt Target</i> game?

262
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,873
We're into it,
but on the deep Web,

263
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,808
multiple shifting identities
are the norm.

264
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,678
Whoever designed this game
is using an anonymous proxy,

265
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,346
which means any traceback
will be TOR'd

266
00:12:09,348 --> 00:12:10,547
and encrypted
to the hilt.

267
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:12,549
How is narrating our process
helping our speed?

268
00:12:14,553 --> 00:12:15,919
Walter?

269
00:12:18,691 --> 00:12:21,325
The CIA and the
Justice Department,

270
00:12:21,327 --> 00:12:23,527
they're certainly working
to find this game designer

271
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:26,163
and coming up blank,
meaning this may take a minute.

272
00:12:26,165 --> 00:12:27,798
They're not us.

273
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,967
And anything that Ralph
was doing on Paige's laptop

274
00:12:29,969 --> 00:12:31,702
will be backed up
to our cloud server.

275
00:12:31,704 --> 00:12:32,970
We know.

276
00:12:32,972 --> 00:12:35,906
We're already
tracking his steps.

277
00:12:35,908 --> 00:12:38,075
I only showed him
the deep Web because

278
00:12:38,077 --> 00:12:40,477
it's where he could find people
like himself, people like us.

279
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:42,146
I'm certain your
intentions were good.

280
00:12:42,148 --> 00:12:44,815
He was engaged,
he was asking questions.

281
00:12:44,817 --> 00:12:48,352
It was like the first time
that I used the Internet.

282
00:12:48,354 --> 00:12:49,787
We were just having fun.

283
00:12:52,591 --> 00:12:54,892
You're reading my body language
and analyzing me.

284
00:12:54,894 --> 00:12:56,627
I was absolutely
doing that.

285
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,930
I'm determining
whether you know

286
00:12:59,932 --> 00:13:02,366
that mentoring a young person
is about more than just fun.

287
00:13:02,368 --> 00:13:04,401
Of course I know that.

288
00:13:08,307 --> 00:13:10,374
Hey, Ralph,
how's it going, pal?

289
00:13:10,376 --> 00:13:12,543
Heard you
held up like a champ.

290
00:13:12,545 --> 00:13:14,511
Better than my first arrest.

291
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,982
That was inappropriate.

292
00:13:19,485 --> 00:13:20,717
Use the loft.

293
00:13:29,061 --> 00:13:30,527
Back to work.
Walter.

294
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:31,862
I may have found
the game designer

295
00:13:31,864 --> 00:13:33,030
buried beneath seven layers
of encryption

296
00:13:33,032 --> 00:13:35,399
on the<i> Overt Target</i>
message board.

297
00:13:35,401 --> 00:13:37,134
Took me, like,
15 minutes to crack.

298
00:13:37,136 --> 00:13:39,236
An eternity.

299
00:13:39,238 --> 00:13:41,138
There's something
you need to see.

300
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,140
Get a little rest.

301
00:13:43,142 --> 00:13:44,208
I'll be downstairs.

302
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,810
If you need me,
tell Drew.

303
00:13:46,812 --> 00:13:49,113
Look, um...

304
00:13:49,115 --> 00:13:52,116
I can handle what Walter said
earlier, and I accept it,

305
00:13:52,118 --> 00:13:54,651
but this situation, his
exposure to the team...

306
00:13:54,653 --> 00:13:56,553
You don't see
the amazing things they do.

307
00:13:56,555 --> 00:13:57,721
They're brilliant.

308
00:13:57,723 --> 00:13:59,823
They're adults,
in an adult world.

309
00:13:59,825 --> 00:14:01,692
You don't know them like I do.

310
00:14:01,694 --> 00:14:02,960
They would never hurt Ralph.

311
00:14:02,962 --> 00:14:04,094
And yet, here we are.

312
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:06,697
Look, I don't have
any right to push you.

313
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:08,031
But his Internet usage...

314
00:14:08,033 --> 00:14:09,633
Oh, he's never playing
that game again.

315
00:14:09,635 --> 00:14:11,735
All his Internet
will be monitored.

316
00:14:11,737 --> 00:14:14,404
Good. So we're on
the same page.

317
00:14:14,406 --> 00:14:16,573
I appreciate you being paternal.

318
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,910
Walter is Ralph's friend
and a huge asset,

319
00:14:19,912 --> 00:14:23,147
but this was not
his finest moment.

320
00:14:24,316 --> 00:14:26,450
We're trying to give
Ralph some time to rest.

321
00:14:26,452 --> 00:14:28,919
It's important.

322
00:14:28,921 --> 00:14:30,420
Hey, Ralph.

323
00:14:30,422 --> 00:14:32,456
Hey, buddy.

324
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,459
In the<i> Overt Target</i> chat room,
did you ever communicate

325
00:14:35,461 --> 00:14:37,394
with someone called
“Minidanger”?

326
00:14:39,665 --> 00:14:42,166
Son, just tell us what
you talked about, that's all.

327
00:14:42,168 --> 00:14:45,102
I just said the level one entry

328
00:14:45,104 --> 00:14:48,138
into the abandoned warehouse
was too easy to find.

329
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,040
There should be
a hidden entrance.

330
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:51,608
And he responded to you?

331
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,211
He said, “Okay”"
And then what happened?

332
00:14:54,213 --> 00:14:57,548
He changed the game.

333
00:14:59,351 --> 00:15:02,853
I assume it's bad he was
talking to the game designer?

334
00:15:02,855 --> 00:15:05,656
Ralph made a suggestion
that helped modify the game.

335
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:07,691
Do you know how that's
gonna look to Eckherd

336
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:09,760
when he finds out?
Ralph did nothing wrong.

337
00:15:09,762 --> 00:15:10,861
He was asked if he helped

338
00:15:10,863 --> 00:15:12,763
design the game, Ralph said no.

339
00:15:12,765 --> 00:15:14,865
But we have proof
that he did help.

340
00:15:14,867 --> 00:15:16,633
Unknowingly.

341
00:15:16,635 --> 00:15:19,703
American agents were killed
as a result of this game.

342
00:15:19,705 --> 00:15:21,138
And the CIA has been

343
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,674
searching like hell
for the culprits.

344
00:15:23,676 --> 00:15:26,877
If need be, they may just
make an example out of Ralph.

345
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:28,178
They'll cut his computer use,

346
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,681
put him on a no-fly list
for the rest of his life.

347
00:15:30,683 --> 00:15:33,050
He may never get a job
beyond flipping burgers.

348
00:15:33,052 --> 00:15:34,418
Basically,
everything that would've

349
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,321
happened to Walt
if Cabe hadn't shown up.

350
00:15:37,323 --> 00:15:38,889
So now we need to locate
the game designer,

351
00:15:38,891 --> 00:15:40,057
Minidanger.

352
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:41,858
He's the only one
that can confirm

353
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,627
that Ralph's game suggestions
were innocent.

354
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:45,529
Guys, I'm actually communicating

355
00:15:45,531 --> 00:15:48,131
with Minidanger right now
in another chat room.

356
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:49,633
He just responded to you?

357
00:15:49,635 --> 00:15:50,834
I called him
a “no talent,

358
00:15:50,836 --> 00:15:52,703
dimwit, fart
of a game designer.”

359
00:15:52,705 --> 00:15:54,738
I said his work reminded me
of something

360
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,740
a dog might deliver
after eating old cheese.

361
00:15:56,742 --> 00:15:57,808
What are you talking about?

362
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,176
It's egomania.

363
00:15:59,178 --> 00:16:01,111
It runs rampant with artists,
writers and game designers.

364
00:16:01,113 --> 00:16:02,980
Especially the latter,

365
00:16:02,982 --> 00:16:05,782
who grew up maligned by jocks
and ignored by cheerleaders.

366
00:16:05,784 --> 00:16:07,751
- Like us?
- Yeah, so now these guys

367
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:09,519
have this muscle to flex.

368
00:16:09,521 --> 00:16:10,687
And these chat rooms?

369
00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:12,689
Just a constant joystick
measuring contest.

370
00:16:12,691 --> 00:16:15,025
Best way to get a response
is with insults.

371
00:16:15,027 --> 00:16:17,828
Admittedly, it's a shot
in the dark, but he responded.

372
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,496
From a mobile device?

373
00:16:19,498 --> 00:16:21,131
Which can be traced.

374
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:22,532
Keep insulting him.

375
00:16:22,534 --> 00:16:24,001
Keep him responding.

376
00:16:24,003 --> 00:16:25,435
Happy, you'll trace
from the SUV.

377
00:16:25,437 --> 00:16:27,638
Okay, guys, let's go!

378
00:16:31,343 --> 00:16:33,477
Of course he's here.

379
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:35,145
Three times
I've called Minidanger

380
00:16:35,147 --> 00:16:37,180
an undescended cat gonad,
still no response.

381
00:16:37,182 --> 00:16:39,483
The last communication came
from inside the building.

382
00:16:39,485 --> 00:16:40,784
Oh, and, Cabe, stay here.

383
00:16:40,786 --> 00:16:42,085
Why the hell
would I do that?

384
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:44,154
I think you might stand out
as a federal agent.

385
00:16:44,156 --> 00:16:45,489
Exactamundo.

386
00:16:47,226 --> 00:16:48,959
What are you doing?
Excellent question.

387
00:16:48,961 --> 00:16:50,127
These
tournaments can be

388
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:52,129
a crucible for hackers,
dark site trolls.

389
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:54,197
Never bring your credit
cards to a place like this.

390
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:55,199
Less savory types

391
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,533
will carry
pocket scanners

392
00:16:56,535 --> 00:16:58,702
that'll get your numbers
from the magnetic strips.

393
00:16:59,405 --> 00:17:01,305
My God.

394
00:17:01,307 --> 00:17:03,140
All right, we're on comms.

395
00:17:08,614 --> 00:17:10,147
I've seen pictures
of these conventions.

396
00:17:10,149 --> 00:17:11,448
They don't do them justice.

397
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,984
World's largest
gathering of virgins.

398
00:17:13,986 --> 00:17:15,385
I don't know.

399
00:17:15,387 --> 00:17:17,387
The after-hours parties at these
things can get pretty filthy.

400
00:17:17,389 --> 00:17:18,555
So I've read.

401
00:17:18,557 --> 00:17:21,291
The last signal leads
to the room down there.

402
00:17:24,797 --> 00:17:26,830
Hi. Hi, there.

403
00:17:26,832 --> 00:17:28,899
Uh, we need access to this room.

404
00:17:28,901 --> 00:17:30,534
That's the VIP tournament area.

405
00:17:30,536 --> 00:17:32,369
Access is by game play only.

406
00:17:32,371 --> 00:17:33,837
30 Dino kills
in 30 seconds.

407
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:36,740
30 kills in 30 seconds on a game
no one's played in ten years?

408
00:17:36,742 --> 00:17:38,842
That's the rule, Grandpa.
I didn't make it.

409
00:17:38,844 --> 00:17:41,511
“Grandpa”? I'm 32.

410
00:17:41,513 --> 00:17:42,846
Hey, guys,

411
00:17:42,848 --> 00:17:44,815
the last ping from Minidanger
came from in that room.

412
00:17:44,817 --> 00:17:46,450
If I can get 30 kills
in ten seconds,

413
00:17:46,452 --> 00:17:47,551
can all my friends get in?

414
00:17:47,553 --> 00:17:49,086
Not possible.

415
00:18:07,573 --> 00:18:09,606
Thirty-three.

416
00:18:11,877 --> 00:18:14,211
I've never seen anything
like that before.

417
00:18:14,213 --> 00:18:15,379
Can we go in now?

418
00:18:16,115 --> 00:18:16,747
Yeah.

419
00:18:16,749 --> 00:18:19,049
Thanks.

420
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:21,118
Wait, I have seen something
like that before.

421
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,087
Hey, wait.

422
00:18:24,089 --> 00:18:25,789
Is he El Guapo?

423
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,525
“El Guapo”?

424
00:18:36,535 --> 00:18:37,934
What's our progress?

425
00:18:37,936 --> 00:18:39,603
Nothing more
from Minidanger.

426
00:18:39,605 --> 00:18:42,105
Makes it a bit of a needle
in a haystack.

427
00:18:42,107 --> 00:18:43,440
Unless he's playing.

428
00:18:45,644 --> 00:18:47,644
Maybe the guy on the left.
Sensitive face.

429
00:18:47,646 --> 00:18:49,413
I can see him
being easy to offend.

430
00:18:49,415 --> 00:18:51,081
Catch this guy,
and Ralph's off the hook.

431
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,015
So figure it out.

432
00:18:52,017 --> 00:18:53,383
Mind reader,
get in the game.

433
00:18:53,385 --> 00:18:56,086
You know, I could just
yell out, “Hey, Minidanger,

434
00:18:56,088 --> 00:18:57,387
your government would like
to speak with you.”

435
00:18:57,389 --> 00:18:58,755
But that might
get him running, Cabe.

436
00:18:58,757 --> 00:19:01,191
The kid on stage
just got very alert to you.

437
00:19:01,193 --> 00:19:03,794
Talking with your finger in
your ear might have tipped him.

438
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,797
And I think he made me, too.

439
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:07,864
Yeah!

440
00:19:09,802 --> 00:19:11,568
He's running.
Keep your eye on him.

441
00:19:14,139 --> 00:19:15,505
Great, we lost him.

442
00:19:15,507 --> 00:19:17,274
I got this. I can fix it.

443
00:19:19,178 --> 00:19:21,311
Attention, fans of this game.

444
00:19:21,313 --> 00:19:23,947
We trust you're enjoying
your promotional hooded capes.

445
00:19:23,949 --> 00:19:25,715
You mean Vontanian
cloakings.

446
00:19:25,717 --> 00:19:27,083
That's exactly right.

447
00:19:27,085 --> 00:19:29,352
Now, sewn into the lining
of one, and only one,

448
00:19:29,354 --> 00:19:32,022
cloaking is a ticket
that grants you a small role

449
00:19:32,024 --> 00:19:33,623
in the latest version
of the game.

450
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,559
Yes, that's right!

451
00:19:35,561 --> 00:19:37,994
You could literally be
in the game!

452
00:19:39,264 --> 00:19:41,832
He'll be the only one
still wearing a cape.

453
00:19:42,768 --> 00:19:44,668
I see him, I got him.

454
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,636
There!

455
00:19:46,638 --> 00:19:48,104
Cabe, he's on the move.

456
00:19:48,106 --> 00:19:49,206
He's wearing a red cloak.

457
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,974
Cover the exit
off the main hall,

458
00:19:50,976 --> 00:19:52,609
we'll check the southeast doors.

459
00:19:56,148 --> 00:19:58,181
Out of my way.

460
00:19:58,183 --> 00:19:59,549
Excuse me.

461
00:20:08,494 --> 00:20:11,161
Thanks.

462
00:20:13,332 --> 00:20:15,298
I'm telling you,
swearing to you,

463
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,334
whatever you think I did,
you have the wrong guy.

464
00:20:17,336 --> 00:20:21,204
Did you design the game<i> Overt</i>
<i>Target</i> and post it online?

465
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,408
Then we have the right guy.

466
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,510
All right, this is good.

467
00:20:26,512 --> 00:20:29,079
He admits to
designing the game.

468
00:20:29,081 --> 00:20:31,314
Yeah, but why so easily?

469
00:20:31,316 --> 00:20:32,415
Wait, stop.

470
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:33,550
What secret level?

471
00:20:33,552 --> 00:20:35,285
There's no secret level
in my game.

472
00:20:35,287 --> 00:20:37,754
The Justice Department calls
it “the safe house level”"

473
00:20:37,756 --> 00:20:39,756
It's awfully authentic.

474
00:20:39,758 --> 00:20:42,058
What do you know about the hack
of the Langley mainframe

475
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,227
at CIA headquarters
three weeks ago?

476
00:20:45,063 --> 00:20:46,796
Oh, my God.

477
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,033
God ain't here with you, kid.
It's just me.

478
00:20:52,237 --> 00:20:53,270
Now answers.

479
00:20:53,272 --> 00:20:55,071
You can have my laptop,
all my hard drives,

480
00:20:55,073 --> 00:20:56,606
all my data, everything.

481
00:20:56,608 --> 00:21:00,043
If you're so squeaky clean, then
why'd you run at the convention?

482
00:21:00,045 --> 00:21:02,312
All right, all right,
I may have made a few bucks

483
00:21:02,314 --> 00:21:05,282
hacking the DMV to take points
off a few people's licenses.

484
00:21:05,284 --> 00:21:06,116
Well done.

485
00:21:06,118 --> 00:21:07,651
He's telling the truth.

486
00:21:07,653 --> 00:21:08,685
Then how the hell did...

487
00:21:08,687 --> 00:21:09,886
Walter. Walter.
Hey, buddy!

488
00:21:09,888 --> 00:21:11,521
Then how the hell

489
00:21:11,523 --> 00:21:13,323
did the safe house level
get on your game?

490
00:21:13,325 --> 00:21:14,291
Walter, what are you doing?

491
00:21:14,293 --> 00:21:15,325
A ten-year-old

492
00:21:15,327 --> 00:21:17,027
who you involved in this

493
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:18,461
hangs in the balance right now.

494
00:21:18,463 --> 00:21:19,763
I don't know any kid.

495
00:21:19,765 --> 00:21:20,797
ScorpJr1.

496
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,532
You communicated with him.

497
00:21:22,534 --> 00:21:25,135
ScropJr1 is ten?

498
00:21:25,137 --> 00:21:26,369
Wow, he's a smart kid.

499
00:21:26,371 --> 00:21:27,871
But it was just about game play.

500
00:21:27,873 --> 00:21:29,239
No CIA secrets.

501
00:21:29,241 --> 00:21:31,007
I didn't have anything
to do with that.

502
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:32,375
Neither did my partner.

503
00:21:32,377 --> 00:21:33,343
Partner?

504
00:21:33,345 --> 00:21:34,311
Calvin Thorne.

505
00:21:34,313 --> 00:21:35,412
Or maybe you're just

506
00:21:35,414 --> 00:21:36,813
pulling a name out of a hat.

507
00:21:36,815 --> 00:21:38,715
He's not.

508
00:21:38,717 --> 00:21:41,551
Calvin would take
the hard drives, do revisions.

509
00:21:41,553 --> 00:21:43,086
He'd never do anything
like this.

510
00:21:43,088 --> 00:21:44,588
When did you hook up
with this Calvin?

511
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,390
He noticed an early version
of my game online,

512
00:21:46,391 --> 00:21:48,692
then offered to come on board
as a collaborator.

513
00:21:48,694 --> 00:21:50,427
Coding, research.

514
00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:52,796
These spy games
can't write themselves.

515
00:21:59,638 --> 00:22:01,471
I am sensing
integrity markers

516
00:22:01,473 --> 00:22:02,939
in his voice,
his pitch consistency,

517
00:22:02,941 --> 00:22:04,174
lack of shifty eye movement.

518
00:22:04,176 --> 00:22:06,309
He's telling the truth;
there's a Calvin.

519
00:22:06,311 --> 00:22:08,678
Maybe this Calvin
did the CIA hack.

520
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,581
And he commandeered Nate's game
to deliver the intelligence?

521
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,717
Meaning the guy
that stole the CIA Intel,

522
00:22:13,719 --> 00:22:16,353
maybe Calvin, is out there
peddling more information.

523
00:22:16,355 --> 00:22:19,289
Eckherd claims that six other
operations were compromised.

524
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,458
We're talking a hundred
more lives are at risk.

525
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,093
Explain how this worked.

526
00:22:23,095 --> 00:22:25,362
If I stole CIA intelligence,
then I'd need buyers

527
00:22:25,364 --> 00:22:29,099
and a way to deliver the Intel
that wouldn't trace back to me.

528
00:22:29,101 --> 00:22:30,767
He used the black sites
to find the buyers,

529
00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:32,302
then find a patsy-- Nate--

530
00:22:32,304 --> 00:22:34,504
and piggyback the information
into his online project,

531
00:22:34,506 --> 00:22:36,106
in this case, a game.

532
00:22:36,108 --> 00:22:37,140
You tell the buyer

533
00:22:37,142 --> 00:22:38,108
when the game goes live.

534
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,175
You give him the password,

535
00:22:39,177 --> 00:22:41,511
and then he finds
the stolen CIA Intel

536
00:22:41,513 --> 00:22:42,979
hidden in the game.

537
00:22:42,981 --> 00:22:44,047
It's just sitting there,

538
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:45,682
waiting for
the right person to access it.

539
00:22:45,684 --> 00:22:47,283
Except in this case,

540
00:22:47,285 --> 00:22:50,787
the wrong person
found the hidden level-- Ralph.

541
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:53,223
It made him look guilty
because it was hidden so well.

542
00:22:53,225 --> 00:22:54,457
And we're certain that Nate's

543
00:22:54,459 --> 00:22:56,126
told us everything
that he knows?

544
00:22:56,128 --> 00:22:58,261
When it comes to
Russian rockets, I'm all thumbs.

545
00:22:58,263 --> 00:22:59,729
This is sort of my thing.

546
00:22:59,731 --> 00:23:03,133
Wanting Nate to be the bad guy
doesn't make him the bad guy.

547
00:23:03,135 --> 00:23:04,934
Okay, then we should be
talking to Calvin,

548
00:23:04,936 --> 00:23:07,070
'cause he's the one who actually
might have hacked the CIA,

549
00:23:07,072 --> 00:23:08,538
who actually might be
the bad guy,

550
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,206
or we can stand around all day.

551
00:23:24,915 --> 00:23:27,516
Maybe if we take him for
a walk around the block,

552
00:23:27,518 --> 00:23:29,051
he'll get his
appetite back.

553
00:23:29,053 --> 00:23:30,552
No, we need to stay close.

554
00:23:30,554 --> 00:23:32,087
Okay, I'm not trying
to make things worse,

555
00:23:32,089 --> 00:23:34,656
but a few weeks ago, the garage
was torn apart by killers.

556
00:23:34,658 --> 00:23:36,124
It's not exactly a Gymboree.

557
00:23:36,126 --> 00:23:38,026
I've been thinking
the same thing, too, but...

558
00:23:38,028 --> 00:23:39,595
I know you feel Walter
is good for him...

559
00:23:39,597 --> 00:23:42,030
Drew, the whole team
is good for him.

560
00:23:42,032 --> 00:23:45,601
I'm no genius, but I was a kid,
and so were you.

561
00:23:45,603 --> 00:23:48,403
Ralph is special, but that
doesn't mean these guys

562
00:23:48,405 --> 00:23:50,138
should be treating him
like an adult.

563
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,940
Maybe they didn't have

564
00:23:51,942 --> 00:23:53,275
normal childhoods, Paige,

565
00:23:53,277 --> 00:23:55,944
but I'm worried that they may be
taking one from Ralph.

566
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,756
Any luck at Calvin's apartment?

567
00:24:07,758 --> 00:24:09,257
He wasn't home.
Wait, why do you have a safe?

568
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:10,759
There were no
computers in sight,

569
00:24:10,761 --> 00:24:13,829
so whatever tech he's got,
guaranteed he keeps it in there.

570
00:24:13,831 --> 00:24:15,263
You stole that?

571
00:24:15,265 --> 00:24:16,498
Let's go with “seized.”

572
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,966
With CIA operations in jeopardy,

573
00:24:17,968 --> 00:24:20,235
not to mention Ralph, we're not
looking for permissions.

574
00:24:20,237 --> 00:24:22,004
Okay, well, if he wasn't there,
how'd you guys get in?

575
00:24:22,006 --> 00:24:23,006
I picked the lock.

576
00:24:23,007 --> 00:24:25,474
I've been watching Happy.

577
00:24:25,476 --> 00:24:26,675
Yeah, we've noticed.

578
00:24:26,677 --> 00:24:28,010
Speaking of which, where is she?

579
00:24:28,012 --> 00:24:29,077
Keeping an eye on Nate.

580
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,379
No, we got to crack that safe.
Go get her.

581
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:33,515
Hello, didn't I just get
us into that apartment?

582
00:24:33,517 --> 00:24:35,851
You know, she's not the only one
on our team with skills.

583
00:24:35,853 --> 00:24:36,952
All right, you're insulted

584
00:24:36,954 --> 00:24:38,320
because earlier she called you
a spiller.

585
00:24:38,322 --> 00:24:40,355
We can't waste time
just so you can prove her wrong.

586
00:24:40,357 --> 00:24:41,490
I wasn't insulted.

587
00:24:41,492 --> 00:24:43,058
I just have
psychological insight.

588
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,326
I got it.

589
00:24:44,328 --> 00:24:47,095
It's Calvin--
he's cold, precise,

590
00:24:47,097 --> 00:24:48,063
detail-oriented.

591
00:24:48,065 --> 00:24:49,364
I looked around
his place.

592
00:24:49,366 --> 00:24:51,967
With him, it's the
little things.

593
00:24:51,969 --> 00:24:54,836
Pile of mail told us
that his middle initial is “W.”

594
00:24:54,838 --> 00:24:57,606
That is a powerful letter,
and 23rd in the alphabet.

595
00:25:03,313 --> 00:25:05,080
Get Happy.

596
00:25:08,852 --> 00:25:10,919
Cabe, Walter,

597
00:25:10,921 --> 00:25:12,921
Grimace.

598
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:16,892
How long?

599
00:25:16,894 --> 00:25:18,627
Uh, 30 seconds, tops.

600
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,540
There's no computer
in there?

601
00:25:31,542 --> 00:25:32,741
No.

602
00:25:32,743 --> 00:25:35,644
Just a two-terabyte hard drive.

603
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:40,882
That's our main backup storage.

604
00:25:46,223 --> 00:25:48,023
There are multiple index levels
to this thing.

605
00:25:49,293 --> 00:25:51,660
Deep encryption
in the lower depth.

606
00:25:51,662 --> 00:25:53,428
Oh, but look
at what I just found.

607
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,464
CIA files.

608
00:25:55,466 --> 00:25:57,099
Okay, so we know that
six of them were stolen.

609
00:25:57,101 --> 00:25:59,334
Now we know
who stole them.

610
00:25:59,336 --> 00:26:00,469
I-I don't get it.

611
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:03,038
What is this?
He played you.

612
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,507
Six files means
six more safe houses.

613
00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:08,143
CIA operations
and multiple identities

614
00:26:08,145 --> 00:26:09,711
that he can sell and expose,

615
00:26:09,713 --> 00:26:11,480
resulting in how many
more dead agents.

616
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:12,881
These files
are so heavily encrypted

617
00:26:12,883 --> 00:26:15,617
that the only thing we can tell
is that they are CIA files,

618
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:19,287
but to know which six locations
are at risk would take hours.

619
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:20,522
We don't have
that kind of time.

620
00:26:20,524 --> 00:26:22,190
Odds are Calvin's
already sold the Intel

621
00:26:22,192 --> 00:26:23,692
for delivery in the game,

622
00:26:23,694 --> 00:26:25,260
and buyers are waiting.

623
00:26:25,262 --> 00:26:27,429
Statistically,
I'd say that's 91% likely.

624
00:26:27,431 --> 00:26:29,431
Nate, where's Calvin?

625
00:26:29,433 --> 00:26:32,434
First place I'd try is the Brick
and Porter Café on Angel Street.

626
00:26:32,436 --> 00:26:34,169
That's mostly where
we worked on the game.

627
00:26:34,171 --> 00:26:36,171
We're headed there now.
What about me?

628
00:26:36,173 --> 00:26:37,439
You could use a good lawyer.

629
00:26:37,441 --> 00:26:39,107
Wait.

630
00:26:39,109 --> 00:26:40,308
You'll have an easier time
putting him away

631
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,677
with a confession, right?

632
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:44,279
I can get him to talk.

633
00:26:44,281 --> 00:26:45,881
Please, you got
to let me help.

634
00:26:45,883 --> 00:26:47,082
Can you wire him up?

635
00:26:47,084 --> 00:26:48,483
I can do it on the way.

636
00:26:48,485 --> 00:26:50,786
All right, I'll have Eckherd
meet us at the spot.

637
00:26:50,788 --> 00:26:51,853
Happy, you drive
like a maniac.

638
00:26:51,855 --> 00:26:53,522
Get us there fast.
Sweet.

639
00:26:53,524 --> 00:26:54,756
You stay here.

640
00:26:54,758 --> 00:26:56,525
You keep digging
into Calvin's hard drive.

641
00:26:56,527 --> 00:26:58,527
On it.

642
00:27:15,078 --> 00:27:17,212
Calvin's settling into
his second cup of coffee.

643
00:27:17,214 --> 00:27:18,380
The guy's in the zone.

644
00:27:18,382 --> 00:27:20,215
Agent Eckherd's
got his team rolling.

645
00:27:20,217 --> 00:27:21,449
They'll be here
in three minutes.

646
00:27:21,451 --> 00:27:22,818
We're almost done.

647
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,120
We'll be recording everything
you and Calvin say.

648
00:27:25,122 --> 00:27:27,589
I'm sorry I got
that boy involved.

649
00:27:27,591 --> 00:27:29,257
You're not the one
who got him involved.

650
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:30,392
I'm surprised

651
00:27:30,394 --> 00:27:31,593
he was so young.

652
00:27:31,595 --> 00:27:33,361
Dark site board's no place
for a kid.

653
00:27:33,363 --> 00:27:36,164
Please keep your remaining
thoughts to yourself.

654
00:27:37,067 --> 00:27:39,734
Good to go.

655
00:27:39,736 --> 00:27:42,037
Start by telling Calvin
you found the hidden level.

656
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:44,406
Ask him what he put in the game.

657
00:27:44,408 --> 00:27:46,041
Hey.

658
00:27:46,043 --> 00:27:47,609
Are you sure about this?

659
00:27:47,611 --> 00:27:49,544
Yes. I want to make this right.

660
00:27:49,546 --> 00:27:51,479
Just maintain
eye contact

661
00:27:51,481 --> 00:27:54,015
and keep a calm tone
of voice, piece of cake.

662
00:27:54,017 --> 00:27:55,717
Department of Justice
is coming to back us up.

663
00:27:55,719 --> 00:27:56,785
Just stay cool.

664
00:27:56,787 --> 00:27:57,886
Okay.

665
00:28:02,292 --> 00:28:04,125
Hey, man.

666
00:28:04,127 --> 00:28:05,327
Hey, Nate.

667
00:28:05,329 --> 00:28:07,996
What brings you?

668
00:28:07,998 --> 00:28:09,898
I was...

669
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,533
just in the area.

670
00:28:11,535 --> 00:28:13,001
You're sweating like a pig.

671
00:28:13,003 --> 00:28:15,804
It's hot out.

672
00:28:15,806 --> 00:28:18,006
That tone of voice
is anything but calm.

673
00:28:21,511 --> 00:28:22,878
- Yeah, Sylvester?
- Walter,

674
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,247
I found some bad stuff on
the hard drive, personal data.

675
00:28:25,249 --> 00:28:27,849
He erased it a while ago,
but I was able to dig it up.

676
00:28:27,851 --> 00:28:29,417
Turns out, Calvin's name

677
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:30,785
is not Calvin.

678
00:28:30,787 --> 00:28:32,053
It's Donald Chen,

679
00:28:32,055 --> 00:28:33,788
and he's got a record.
Weapons possession,

680
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,824
black hat hacking, assault.

681
00:28:35,826 --> 00:28:38,727
Man, Nate had no idea who
he was getting into bed with.

682
00:28:38,729 --> 00:28:40,095
Nice work, Sylvester.

683
00:28:40,097 --> 00:28:41,396
So what you working on now?

684
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:42,831
Finishing up six new levels

685
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:43,899
for the game.

686
00:28:43,901 --> 00:28:45,200
Launching them in an hour.

687
00:28:45,202 --> 00:28:48,103
That's got to be the other
six stolen CIA files.

688
00:28:48,105 --> 00:28:49,571
He's gonna blow the operations
in one hour.

689
00:28:49,573 --> 00:28:51,273
As soon as he gets a confession
from Calvin,

690
00:28:51,275 --> 00:28:52,207
we go in and it's over.

691
00:28:52,209 --> 00:28:53,909
So-so, look, I, um...

692
00:28:53,911 --> 00:28:55,310
I got to ask you something.

693
00:28:55,312 --> 00:28:56,544
It's pretty weird.

694
00:28:56,546 --> 00:28:58,980
I-I found a hidden level
in our game.

695
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:04,386
Tell you what...
I need a smoke.

696
00:29:04,388 --> 00:29:05,420
I don't like the sound of that,

697
00:29:05,422 --> 00:29:06,721
but we don't have
a confession yet.

698
00:29:06,723 --> 00:29:07,989
We got to get Nate out of there.

699
00:29:07,991 --> 00:29:09,424
Let's talk out back?

700
00:29:09,426 --> 00:29:10,792
They're on the move.
What's out back?

701
00:29:10,794 --> 00:29:13,028
According to satellite maps,
that's an alley.

702
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,896
Calvin,
what are you doing?

703
00:29:14,898 --> 00:29:16,898
We lost contact.
Pull around back now.

704
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,733
Agent Eckherd will meet us.

705
00:29:18,735 --> 00:29:21,536
There he is!
He's on the ground.

706
00:29:21,538 --> 00:29:23,438
I think I see blood.

707
00:29:25,475 --> 00:29:26,574
Nate, what happened?

708
00:29:26,576 --> 00:29:28,443
He stabbed me and ran.

709
00:29:28,445 --> 00:29:29,911
Buddy, hey, hey, buddy. Hey.

710
00:29:31,815 --> 00:29:33,548
Nate, you're gonna be okay.

711
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,749
Hey, look at me, look at me.
You're gonna be fine.

712
00:29:34,751 --> 00:29:37,285
Did your team botch this
all to hell, Gallo?

713
00:29:37,287 --> 00:29:39,054
Not now!
Suspect's in the wind.

714
00:29:39,056 --> 00:29:40,322
Fan out, find him!

715
00:29:40,324 --> 00:29:41,389
Nate, Nate, Nate?

716
00:29:41,391 --> 00:29:42,891
Come on, keep
your eyes open.

717
00:29:42,893 --> 00:29:44,459
He's fading fast.

718
00:29:45,495 --> 00:29:47,796
The Whitehull Hospital
is four minutes away.

719
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:49,631
Okay, we're on it.

720
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:52,233
20 cc's of diesel therapy, stat.

721
00:29:52,235 --> 00:29:53,802
Toby, keep him breathing!

722
00:29:55,372 --> 00:29:57,472
This neighborhood's nothing

723
00:29:57,474 --> 00:29:58,707
but abandoned buildings
and warehouses.

724
00:29:58,709 --> 00:30:00,041
Yeah, plenty of
places to hide.

725
00:30:00,043 --> 00:30:02,010
Oh, this looks familiar.

726
00:30:02,012 --> 00:30:04,112
So you got the bridge,
you got dozens of factories,

727
00:30:04,114 --> 00:30:06,114
you got this café.
We're in the game.

728
00:30:06,116 --> 00:30:07,382
What the hell
are you talking about?

729
00:30:07,384 --> 00:30:08,783
Nate and Calvin designed
the first level

730
00:30:08,785 --> 00:30:09,951
based on what they knew best,

731
00:30:09,953 --> 00:30:11,619
what they were looking at
every day and night

732
00:30:11,621 --> 00:30:13,154
while they were coding
in that café.

733
00:30:13,156 --> 00:30:16,224
So if Calvin's gonna hide,
this is the perfect spot.

734
00:30:16,226 --> 00:30:18,393
No one knows this area
better than he does.

735
00:30:18,395 --> 00:30:20,662
Except Ralph.

736
00:30:20,664 --> 00:30:23,131
He knows the game,
which means he knows this area

737
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:26,267
like the back of his hand.

738
00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:29,471
If we're gonna find Calvin
before he leaks that CIA Intel,

739
00:30:29,473 --> 00:30:31,639
Ralph has to play
that game again

740
00:30:31,641 --> 00:30:32,941
and lead us to him.

741
00:30:32,943 --> 00:30:34,442
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

742
00:30:34,444 --> 00:30:36,444
This morning,
that game landed him

743
00:30:36,446 --> 00:30:38,013
in a room with federal agents.

744
00:30:38,015 --> 00:30:39,814
It's the only way
to find this guy in time.

745
00:30:39,816 --> 00:30:41,449
We only got a half
dozen people searching,

746
00:30:41,451 --> 00:30:42,817
and it's a
massive search.

747
00:30:42,819 --> 00:30:45,086
But right now,
we need an advantage,

748
00:30:45,088 --> 00:30:46,254
and that advantage is Ralph.

749
00:30:46,256 --> 00:30:48,423
I thought he was never
playing that game again.

750
00:30:49,726 --> 00:30:51,893
Mom, can I?

751
00:31:08,276 --> 00:31:10,443
All right,
got to open this up a little,

752
00:31:10,445 --> 00:31:11,778
see where the damage is.

753
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,513
His internal
epiploic artery is cut.

754
00:31:13,515 --> 00:31:16,449
I'm gonna need more pressure.

755
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:18,451
Hey, Happy,
I got to cross a line here.

756
00:31:18,453 --> 00:31:19,752
Do you have a tampon?

757
00:31:19,754 --> 00:31:20,820
Excuse me?

758
00:31:20,822 --> 00:31:22,055
It'll absorb the blood,

759
00:31:22,057 --> 00:31:24,490
expand, increase the pressure
and stop the bleeding.

760
00:31:24,492 --> 00:31:26,392
Uh, toolbox, bottom compartment.

761
00:31:26,394 --> 00:31:28,795
Yeah? Ah!

762
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:35,101
Uh... ah...

763
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:37,270
It's working!

764
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:38,404
Hold on!

765
00:31:40,709 --> 00:31:42,875
I don't like this.

766
00:31:42,877 --> 00:31:45,144
Neither do I, but
they need his help.

767
00:31:45,146 --> 00:31:48,014
I'm in.
Okay, Walter, Ralph's in the game.

768
00:31:48,016 --> 00:31:49,749
Copy.
The best way for us to help you

769
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:51,050
is to pinpoint
your exact location,

770
00:31:51,052 --> 00:31:52,919
go to that same spot
in the game, and guide you.

771
00:31:52,921 --> 00:31:54,721
And, Walter, you need to hurry,

772
00:31:54,723 --> 00:31:56,089
because there's
a countdown clock

773
00:31:56,091 --> 00:31:58,991
with six new levels coming
in 19 minutes and 50 seconds.

774
00:31:58,993 --> 00:32:00,693
We need to catch Calvin
before they're released.

775
00:32:00,695 --> 00:32:02,428
All right, well,
we're on the east side

776
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,497
of Angel Street
outside a factory.

777
00:32:04,499 --> 00:32:05,598
What color is it?

778
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,333
Uh, it's gray and white.

779
00:32:07,335 --> 00:32:08,534
That one has a hidden entrance.

780
00:32:08,536 --> 00:32:10,737
Look for an alley
straight ahead.

781
00:32:10,739 --> 00:32:12,438
The A/C grate
on the north side

782
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,173
by the telephone poles,
enter there.

783
00:32:14,175 --> 00:32:16,309
It accesses a lower level

784
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:18,978
you can't get to
from the main floor.

785
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,947
I'm playing that level now.

786
00:32:23,718 --> 00:32:25,518
Calvin's got to be
hiding in there.

787
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,953
Look alive.

788
00:32:26,955 --> 00:32:29,021
All right, we're heading in.

789
00:32:34,295 --> 00:32:36,796
Did you find hallway PW-99?

790
00:32:39,234 --> 00:32:40,633
Yeah, it's where you
said it would be.

791
00:32:40,635 --> 00:32:42,635
This floor
has the most hiding places.

792
00:32:42,637 --> 00:32:43,870
They should go southeast.

793
00:32:43,872 --> 00:32:46,105
Okay, guys, you heard him.

794
00:32:50,545 --> 00:32:51,878
Hey!

795
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,147
Cabe, Cabe, you okay?

796
00:32:54,149 --> 00:32:55,715
Yeah, I'm good.

797
00:32:55,717 --> 00:32:57,817
Let's go catch
that son of a bitch.

798
00:32:57,819 --> 00:32:59,051
Okay.

799
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:05,825
Two minutes to the E.R.!
Bleeding's under control.

800
00:33:06,895 --> 00:33:08,961
Maybe too much.

801
00:33:10,165 --> 00:33:12,598
Ah, damn, the bleeding slowed
down 'cause his heart stopped.

802
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,933
Where's the quick jump?

803
00:33:13,935 --> 00:33:15,968
Happy!
The jumper cables, now!

804
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,904
Uh, it's, uh...
it's under the console.

805
00:33:17,906 --> 00:33:20,006
Okay, here we go.

806
00:33:20,008 --> 00:33:22,508
So, Doc, clamp the black one
to the metal part of the seat,

807
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,110
and then take the
red one and zap him.

808
00:33:24,112 --> 00:33:25,645
Uh... clear?

809
00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:32,185
All right, he's back.

810
00:33:32,954 --> 00:33:35,154
Holy crap, Dr. Frankenstein!

811
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:40,660
All right, he headed south.
I need a shortcut.

812
00:33:42,197 --> 00:33:44,263
According to Ralph,
look for a door on your left

813
00:33:44,265 --> 00:33:45,598
marked 6-5-9.

814
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,233
That's how Calvin would escape.

815
00:33:47,235 --> 00:33:48,401
Got it. Got it!

816
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:50,570
Okay, head through
the opening in the fence,

817
00:33:50,572 --> 00:33:52,004
and hang a right.

818
00:33:52,006 --> 00:33:54,106
You should
catch up to him there.

819
00:33:55,343 --> 00:33:56,976
Is this my only way out?

820
00:33:56,978 --> 00:33:58,010
It's the fastest.

821
00:33:58,012 --> 00:33:59,645
Stab wound, upper abdomen,

822
00:33:59,647 --> 00:34:01,280
and there's a severed
epiploic artery.

823
00:34:01,282 --> 00:34:03,316
He's gonna need
a couple units in the O.R.

824
00:34:03,318 --> 00:34:06,118
Oh... I'm rocking so much
adrenaline right now,

825
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,787
my blood is basically Red Bull.

826
00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:10,790
Impressive.

827
00:34:10,792 --> 00:34:12,725
Guys, guys...

828
00:34:12,727 --> 00:34:16,329
I'm looking at a...
a rather large drop.

829
00:34:16,331 --> 00:34:18,297
It's unknown depth.
It's, uh...

830
00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:19,732
Yeah, no...
it's too far to jump.

831
00:34:19,734 --> 00:34:21,801
You can jump down
and walk across.

832
00:34:21,803 --> 00:34:22,835
Are you sure?

833
00:34:22,837 --> 00:34:24,403
Yes.
It's only a seven-foot drop.

834
00:34:24,405 --> 00:34:25,738
I can tell by how

835
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,740
the graphics are composited.
I can't see the bottom.

836
00:34:27,742 --> 00:34:29,809
It could be seven feet or 70.

837
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:31,244
Now, are you sure, Ralph?

838
00:34:31,246 --> 00:34:33,045
Scoop.
What?

839
00:34:33,047 --> 00:34:34,747
It's about a scoop
of ice cream after school.

840
00:34:34,749 --> 00:34:36,716
He-He'd make me “scoop swear”
that we'd actually go.

841
00:34:36,718 --> 00:34:38,751
It's the strongest promise
he can make.

842
00:34:38,753 --> 00:34:40,753
Okay.

843
00:34:40,755 --> 00:34:43,155
I trust you, Ralph.

844
00:35:02,106 --> 00:35:03,105
Walter?

845
00:35:03,107 --> 00:35:04,139
Are you okay?

846
00:35:04,141 --> 00:35:06,275
Yeah, thanks to Ralph.

847
00:35:12,116 --> 00:35:13,983
I got a visual. He's fast.

848
00:35:13,985 --> 00:35:15,084
You can stop him.

849
00:35:15,086 --> 00:35:16,452
There should be a lever
in front of you.

850
00:35:16,454 --> 00:35:18,821
It opens the storage bay
in front of the exit.

851
00:35:19,657 --> 00:35:22,224
I see the lever.
Pull it! Pull it now!

852
00:35:27,932 --> 00:35:28,932
Did it work?

853
00:35:32,269 --> 00:35:34,637
Walter?

854
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:37,006
Yeah, it worked.

855
00:35:43,381 --> 00:35:45,481
You're really going
at that thing, huh?

856
00:35:45,483 --> 00:35:46,915
It calms me.

857
00:35:46,917 --> 00:35:50,319
After today... calm is good.

858
00:35:50,321 --> 00:35:52,488
Hey, E.R. doc called.

859
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,289
Looks like Nate's gonna make it.

860
00:35:55,259 --> 00:35:56,925
You know, no one on
this team could've

861
00:35:56,927 --> 00:35:58,861
pulled off what
you did today.

862
00:35:58,863 --> 00:36:00,362
Well done.

863
00:36:02,466 --> 00:36:04,099
You know,
something occurred to me.

864
00:36:04,101 --> 00:36:07,369
For your rocket--
with trauma wounds,

865
00:36:07,371 --> 00:36:09,638
the body protects the head
and the heart and the gut

866
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,774
by focusing blood flow
in those areas,

867
00:36:11,776 --> 00:36:13,308
just like Nate's body
did today.

868
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,343
So, with your rocket,

869
00:36:14,345 --> 00:36:16,879
what if you adjusted
fuel flow the same way?

870
00:36:16,881 --> 00:36:18,914
Cover the injector head
with a metal plate

871
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:20,949
that's perforated with holes,
like stab wounds.

872
00:36:20,951 --> 00:36:22,785
Covering more or fewer
of the holes

873
00:36:22,787 --> 00:36:25,120
will allow for
a variable fuel flow<i> and...</i>

874
00:36:25,122 --> 00:36:27,122
increase throttleability.

875
00:36:27,124 --> 00:36:29,491
That's a good idea.

876
00:36:29,493 --> 00:36:30,726
I got a million of them.

877
00:36:31,762 --> 00:36:34,563
Hey, Walt...

878
00:36:34,565 --> 00:36:35,698
about the kid?

879
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,399
Yeah, we were having fun.

880
00:36:37,401 --> 00:36:40,569
Um... too much fun.

881
00:36:40,571 --> 00:36:42,604
Look, he needs you,
you're a huge part of his life,

882
00:36:42,606 --> 00:36:43,972
but you can't just
be his friend.

883
00:36:43,974 --> 00:36:45,541
You got to be
the grown-up, too.

884
00:36:46,377 --> 00:36:48,177
Yeah.

885
00:36:52,817 --> 00:36:54,316
We have a celebrity
in our midst.

886
00:36:54,318 --> 00:36:55,984
Oh, stop,
you're making me blush.

887
00:36:55,986 --> 00:36:57,152
Not you, idiot.

888
00:36:57,154 --> 00:36:58,554
An online video?
What...?

889
00:36:58,556 --> 00:37:01,657
“El Guapo sets another record.”

890
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:02,825
What is that?
What?

891
00:37:02,827 --> 00:37:04,526
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

892
00:37:04,528 --> 00:37:05,928
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

893
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,129
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

894
00:37:07,131 --> 00:37:08,764
Wait a minute.

895
00:37:08,766 --> 00:37:11,767
Is that
a young Sylvester?

896
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:13,035
Yup.

897
00:37:13,037 --> 00:37:15,504
Earlier, that gamer girl
asked me if Sly was El Guapo.

898
00:37:15,506 --> 00:37:16,605
Now we know why.

899
00:37:16,607 --> 00:37:18,707
Please... no.

900
00:37:20,578 --> 00:37:22,644
Those are some
fascinating moves.

901
00:37:23,714 --> 00:37:27,182
Hard to look at,
but impossible to turn away.

902
00:37:28,252 --> 00:37:29,818
El Guapo!

903
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,353
El Guapo!

904
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:37,292
Life will never be the same.

905
00:37:37,294 --> 00:37:39,895
I can't believe
this was online for seven years

906
00:37:39,897 --> 00:37:41,330
and you never said anything
about it.

907
00:37:41,332 --> 00:37:44,733
The fashion is unflattering,
and the dance is derivative.

908
00:37:44,735 --> 00:37:46,568
You're their hero.

909
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:49,204
Well, I guess we all have
our hidden talents.

910
00:37:49,206 --> 00:37:51,073
That's beautifully put,
El Guapo.

911
00:37:58,582 --> 00:38:01,450
For what it's worth,
I know it's my fault

912
00:38:01,452 --> 00:38:03,452
that you're here
in the first place,

913
00:38:03,454 --> 00:38:06,088
so I'm gonna make it right.

914
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:08,657
I'm gonna work my ass off
for that gig in Portland,

915
00:38:08,659 --> 00:38:11,193
give you and Ralph a
shot at something else.

916
00:38:11,195 --> 00:38:13,862
This is not about you and me
getting back together.

917
00:38:13,864 --> 00:38:16,632
This is about us being a family,

918
00:38:16,634 --> 00:38:20,202
all in the same place, all safe.

919
00:38:20,204 --> 00:38:22,538
What if we don't want to leave?

920
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,940
Well, before you have a choice,
how can you know?

921
00:38:28,979 --> 00:38:30,412
Uh, we're heading out.

922
00:38:30,414 --> 00:38:32,614
Just packing up Ralph's things.

923
00:38:32,616 --> 00:38:35,417
Take your time.

924
00:38:35,419 --> 00:38:37,452
I apologize for everything
I did to contribute

925
00:38:37,454 --> 00:38:39,288
to what Ralph
went through today.

926
00:38:41,425 --> 00:38:42,791
But...

927
00:38:42,793 --> 00:38:45,294
There it is.

928
00:38:49,033 --> 00:38:51,466
But I do want to note,

929
00:38:51,468 --> 00:38:54,703
those stolen CIA files
contained the identities

930
00:38:54,705 --> 00:38:56,972
of 43 undercover operatives.

931
00:38:56,974 --> 00:39:00,576
They, in turn,
protected 356 source assets

932
00:39:00,578 --> 00:39:03,645
relating to drug trafficking,
gangs,

933
00:39:03,647 --> 00:39:05,814
loose nuclear material.

934
00:39:05,816 --> 00:39:08,383
By preventing the release
of those files,

935
00:39:08,385 --> 00:39:11,353
Ralph saved
innumerable lives today.

936
00:39:12,189 --> 00:39:14,556
I'm glad he could help.

937
00:39:16,493 --> 00:39:18,861
I'm just not sure
it's a good idea

938
00:39:18,863 --> 00:39:21,063
for him to grow up this fast.

939
00:39:23,234 --> 00:39:25,601
Ralph sees us
using our heads for good.

940
00:39:25,603 --> 00:39:29,338
He's learning how to be
a grown-up genius someday.

941
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,840
We're not trying
to make him a grown-up now.

942
00:39:33,978 --> 00:39:36,178
I'll meet you downstairs.

943
00:39:39,717 --> 00:39:42,017
I'm aware I screwed up.

944
00:39:42,019 --> 00:39:44,987
I just wish
I could get a guarantee from you

945
00:39:44,989 --> 00:39:46,555
that this won't happen again.

946
00:39:46,557 --> 00:39:48,090
I'm not sure I can give you one.

947
00:39:48,092 --> 00:39:51,426
I know you can't.

948
00:39:51,428 --> 00:39:53,762
So what do I gamble on, Walter?

949
00:39:53,764 --> 00:39:56,999
I couldn't advise you;
gambling is Toby's department.

950
00:39:58,936 --> 00:40:03,672
Paige, I care about
this team and our work...

951
00:40:03,674 --> 00:40:07,075
but what I care about most...

952
00:40:09,113 --> 00:40:12,047
...is giving Ralph a safe place
to reach his potential.

953
00:40:12,049 --> 00:40:14,616
He has a lot of it.
I know that, too.

954
00:40:16,854 --> 00:40:20,155
Oh. Do you remember
when you and Ralph turned up,

955
00:40:20,157 --> 00:40:21,523
and I gave him that riddle?

956
00:40:21,525 --> 00:40:24,559
What is a group
of jellyfish called?

957
00:40:24,561 --> 00:40:26,061
Yeah. A smack?

958
00:40:26,063 --> 00:40:29,398
If you want to give me one now,
I would understand.

959
00:40:33,737 --> 00:40:35,737
That's funny, Walter.

960
00:40:35,739 --> 00:40:37,940
I do try.

961
00:40:37,942 --> 00:40:40,275
I know you do.
