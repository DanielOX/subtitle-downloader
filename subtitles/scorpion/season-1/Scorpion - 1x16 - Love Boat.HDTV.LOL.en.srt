1
00:00:03,532 --> 00:00:05,399
WALTER:
<i>My name is Walter O'Brien.</i>

2
00:00:05,401 --> 00:00:09,770
<i>I have the fourth highest IQ</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

3
00:00:09,772 --> 00:00:11,505
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

4
00:00:11,507 --> 00:00:14,108
<i>When I was 11, the FBI</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking NASA</i>

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,811
<i>to get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

6
00:00:16,813 --> 00:00:19,013
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

7
00:00:19,015 --> 00:00:20,481
<i>tackling worldwide threats</i>

8
00:00:20,483 --> 00:00:21,982
<i>only we can solve.</i>

9
00:00:21,984 --> 00:00:23,751
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

10
00:00:23,753 --> 00:00:25,486
<i>Sylvester's a human calculator.</i>

11
00:00:25,488 --> 00:00:27,855
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

12
00:00:27,857 --> 00:00:30,124
<i>Agent Cabe Gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

13
00:00:30,126 --> 00:00:32,326
<i>And Paige?</i>
<i>Well, Paige isn't like us.</i>

14
00:00:32,328 --> 00:00:34,829
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

15
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:37,398
<i>while we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,533
<i>Together, we are Scorpion.</i>

17
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:46,974
MAN:
Looks like we're about 15 miles

18
00:00:46,976 --> 00:00:49,310
outside of Pendleton.
Not a moment too soon.

19
00:00:49,312 --> 00:00:51,045
I got to waz again.

20
00:00:53,315 --> 00:00:56,450
Hey, what's this guy doing?

21
00:00:56,452 --> 00:00:59,053
Whoa, whoa. Whoa!
What the hell?!

22
00:00:59,055 --> 00:01:00,454
Out of the truck now!

23
00:01:00,456 --> 00:01:02,957
Get out!

24
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:04,458
Please, don't shoot! Please!

25
00:01:20,942 --> 00:01:22,576
Take the rockets.

26
00:01:22,578 --> 00:01:25,145
Leave the bodies.

27
00:01:25,147 --> 00:01:27,681
Got it.

28
00:01:37,692 --> 00:01:39,493
TOBY:
<i>Well, this is highly illegal.</i>

29
00:01:39,495 --> 00:01:41,095
I'm simply expediting things

30
00:01:41,097 --> 00:01:42,997
through technological
intervention.

31
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:45,065
You're hacking into a site
that charges for reservations

32
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:47,101
to save the 20 bucks.
Nope.

33
00:01:47,103 --> 00:01:49,169
They were fully booked.

34
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:50,704
Dinner for two at Escala?

35
00:01:50,706 --> 00:01:52,840
One of the ten hottest
spots in town.

36
00:01:52,842 --> 00:01:55,476
Yes, Walter, I would be
happy to dine with you.

37
00:01:55,478 --> 00:01:56,911
Oh, nice try.

38
00:01:56,913 --> 00:01:58,646
It's a business dinner.

39
00:01:58,648 --> 00:02:01,982
Need to go over some office
data entry protocol with Paige.

40
00:02:01,984 --> 00:02:05,653
You are taking Paige
to a top L.A. eatery

41
00:02:05,655 --> 00:02:07,087
on Valentine's Day?

42
00:02:07,089 --> 00:02:10,157
Just one week after Drew
signed a month-long contract

43
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,392
to pitch in Portland.

44
00:02:11,394 --> 00:02:13,027
How convenient.

45
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:14,929
Is Valentine's this weekend?

46
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:16,630
I had no idea.
Should I get the extinguisher?

47
00:02:16,632 --> 00:02:18,599
'Cause your pants
are on fire, liar, liar.

48
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:20,701
You don't think Paige
notices the timing?

49
00:02:20,703 --> 00:02:23,304
It is a business meeting.

50
00:02:23,306 --> 00:02:26,607
Valentine's is a scam created
by the greeting card industry.

51
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:28,108
The only reason why
I picked that place is

52
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,944
because Paige mentioned it.

53
00:02:29,946 --> 00:02:31,912
The cherry on top
of the denial sundae.

54
00:02:31,914 --> 00:02:34,581
You're being attentive
to her wants.

55
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:35,716
PAIGE:
Good morning, guys.

56
00:02:35,718 --> 00:02:37,518
Paige.
Ms. Dineen.

57
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,919
I brought donuts.

58
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:41,956
Oh, thank you.

59
00:02:43,658 --> 00:02:45,726
It's a date!
Grow up.

60
00:02:45,728 --> 00:02:48,162
For dessert, you should order
<i>Phoenix dactylifera.</i>

61
00:02:48,164 --> 00:02:49,630
Why? Because that's
the botanical name for dates?

62
00:02:49,632 --> 00:02:50,597
Yup.

63
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,333
This conversation's over.

64
00:02:54,836 --> 00:02:56,136
What you got there, pal?

65
00:02:56,138 --> 00:02:58,505
Nada.

66
00:02:58,507 --> 00:03:00,341
CABE:
Hope you're caffeinated!

67
00:03:00,343 --> 00:03:02,042
'Cause it's time
to punch the clock.

68
00:03:02,044 --> 00:03:04,778
Last night a weapons
manufacturer was ambushed.

69
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,014
A shipment of high-tech,

70
00:03:07,016 --> 00:03:10,250
lightweight, shoulder-launch
rockets were stolen.

71
00:03:10,252 --> 00:03:11,018
Oh, God!

72
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,754
Homeland has received Intel

73
00:03:13,756 --> 00:03:15,322
that an arms dealer,
who we only know as Christoph,

74
00:03:15,324 --> 00:03:16,724
is behind it.

75
00:03:16,726 --> 00:03:18,392
He's never been
photographed or I.D.'d.

76
00:03:18,394 --> 00:03:21,729
But he's known to sell across
the globe to Rwanda and Somalia

77
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:23,163
Any weapon to suit
your genocide needs, huh?

78
00:03:23,165 --> 00:03:24,331
This is a bad, bad man.

79
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,266
Yes, and he's stolen
a very bad piece

80
00:03:26,268 --> 00:03:27,601
of experimental hardware.

81
00:03:27,603 --> 00:03:29,436
These rockets have
a range nine times

82
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:30,604
the standard with
laser guidance

83
00:03:30,606 --> 00:03:32,740
technology that makes
them impossible

84
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:34,241
to shake once they
lock on target.

85
00:03:34,243 --> 00:03:36,577
All in the size of
a Louisville Slugger.

86
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:38,445
So, if the rockets
were stolen last night,

87
00:03:38,447 --> 00:03:39,546
they're already on the move.

88
00:03:39,548 --> 00:03:40,714
Correct, but we've
traced them to the Port

89
00:03:40,716 --> 00:03:42,416
of Long Beach through
satellite footage.

90
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:45,252
So, you want us to identify
the shipping container?

91
00:03:45,254 --> 00:03:46,754
There is no shipping container.

92
00:03:46,756 --> 00:03:48,322
Apparently Christoph is using

93
00:03:48,324 --> 00:03:50,657
a luxury cruise line
as transport.

94
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:52,026
He's one of 100 passengers.

95
00:03:52,028 --> 00:03:54,495
The one percent
of the one percent.

96
00:03:54,497 --> 00:03:56,730
Ride in style,
avoid airport security.

97
00:03:56,732 --> 00:03:58,465
I want to be rich just once.

98
00:03:58,467 --> 00:04:00,434
Stop gambling.
Stop judging.

99
00:04:00,436 --> 00:04:01,602
PAIGE:
So, if you think you know

100
00:04:01,604 --> 00:04:03,670
the boat he's using,
go take him down.

101
00:04:03,672 --> 00:04:07,508
We're looking for a bigger fish.
Not that simple.

102
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,209
Homeland wants us to hack into

103
00:04:09,211 --> 00:04:11,211
the guidance system
of each munition,

104
00:04:11,213 --> 00:04:14,481
and plant GPS tracking software
so that we can find out

105
00:04:14,483 --> 00:04:16,083
who Christoph sells them to.

106
00:04:16,085 --> 00:04:17,684
So, there's no time to waste.

107
00:04:17,686 --> 00:04:19,019
Now...

108
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:22,189
who's up for a little
James Bond action?

109
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:23,323
Sweet.

110
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:24,358
Cool.

111
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,360
Not me.

112
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:26,326
Let's do it.

113
00:04:26,328 --> 00:04:28,095
Now, I just have to save it

114
00:04:28,097 --> 00:04:31,532
with the virus I embedded and...

115
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:32,699
done! How long?

116
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:34,968
14 minutes and 32 seconds.

117
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,004
I just downloaded
the blueprints.

118
00:04:37,006 --> 00:04:39,940
I'd say he'd put them near
the engine room or cargo hold.

119
00:04:39,942 --> 00:04:41,275
It's secluded.

120
00:04:41,277 --> 00:04:44,211
CABE: You got 20 rockets to
disarm in 14 minutes a pop.

121
00:04:44,213 --> 00:04:45,446
We're never gonna get
five hours alone.

122
00:04:45,448 --> 00:04:46,980
We won't need it.
These rockets are

123
00:04:46,982 --> 00:04:49,049
interfaced like
a laptop, phone and tablet.

124
00:04:49,051 --> 00:04:51,752
I program one, they all link up
disabled and trackable.

125
00:04:51,754 --> 00:04:52,986
How do we get aboard?

126
00:04:52,988 --> 00:04:54,421
We go as passengers.

127
00:04:54,423 --> 00:04:55,522
It's fully booked.

128
00:04:55,524 --> 00:04:57,191
But we can create a vacancy.

129
00:04:57,193 --> 00:04:58,559
Just got to find the right guy.

130
00:04:58,561 --> 00:04:59,726
Haven't rich people ever heard

131
00:04:59,728 --> 00:05:01,328
of Legionnaire's disease?

132
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,429
Ahoy, mateys!

133
00:05:02,431 --> 00:05:04,231
It's Chaz Bonesteel.

134
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:05,666
It must be a family name?

135
00:05:05,668 --> 00:05:08,001
From what I see here,
it's the only name that matters.

136
00:05:08,003 --> 00:05:10,671
At 21, he invested
his life savings

137
00:05:10,673 --> 00:05:12,840
in land thought
to be valueless.

138
00:05:12,842 --> 00:05:14,341
At now at 25,

139
00:05:14,343 --> 00:05:16,777
he's worth nine figures

140
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:19,613
and at the epicenter
of the oil shale boom.

141
00:05:19,615 --> 00:05:21,915
He's considered
an investment guru.

142
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:23,717
Oh, and intense
about his privacy.

143
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:25,652
Known for not having
a single photo online.

144
00:05:25,654 --> 00:05:26,720
No one's even sure
what he looks like.

145
00:05:26,722 --> 00:05:29,256
Okay, so what does
that have do with us?

146
00:05:29,258 --> 00:05:31,758
Well, he booked
the Excelsior Suite

147
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,160
for himself, his wife, Alissa,

148
00:05:33,162 --> 00:05:35,229
their personal valet
and trainer.

149
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:36,964
That's four people.
WALTER: Okay.

150
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:39,766
Cabe, Sylvester, Paige, myself.

151
00:05:39,768 --> 00:05:42,069
We'll pose as them
to get access to the boat.

152
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:43,937
Okay, uh, here's a shocker.

153
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:45,939
I don't like boats.

154
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:47,708
Primarily because they're
on the water.

155
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,443
And I don't like water.

156
00:05:49,445 --> 00:05:51,278
We'll need three minutes
to get up the plank,

157
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,013
five to get
to the bowels,

158
00:05:53,015 --> 00:05:54,481
approximately five minutes

159
00:05:54,483 --> 00:05:57,084
to locate the weapons
and 14 minutes

160
00:05:57,086 --> 00:05:59,786
and 32 seconds
to disarm and reprogram them.

161
00:05:59,788 --> 00:06:01,755
That's 27 minutes
and 32 seconds.

162
00:06:01,757 --> 00:06:03,090
So, we'll be off the boat

163
00:06:03,092 --> 00:06:04,992
by the time it departs.

164
00:06:04,994 --> 00:06:06,393
Besides you're
the only one of us

165
00:06:06,395 --> 00:06:07,661
that can pass for a 25-year-old.

166
00:06:07,663 --> 00:06:10,097
Guess I'll be the trainer.

167
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:11,231
(laughs):
Right.

168
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:12,599
Oh, you're serious.

169
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:14,134
Okay.

170
00:06:14,136 --> 00:06:17,204
You'll be the trainer.
I will be the valet.

171
00:06:17,206 --> 00:06:18,839
Sylvester, you'll be Chaz.

172
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:19,907
And, Paige,
you'll be Alissa.

173
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:21,475
And the real Alissa and Chaz?

174
00:06:21,477 --> 00:06:22,976
Uh, aren't they boarding
in a few hours?

175
00:06:22,978 --> 00:06:24,444
I'll make a call.
They'll have a little

176
00:06:24,446 --> 00:06:26,346
trouble at customs when
they get in from Canada.

177
00:06:26,348 --> 00:06:27,447
Walter, gear up.

178
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:28,949
Happy, counterfeit some I.D.'s

179
00:06:28,951 --> 00:06:30,350
and tickets.
Toby, put together a file

180
00:06:30,352 --> 00:06:31,418
of everything you can find

181
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,586
on the Bonesteels.

182
00:06:32,588 --> 00:06:33,887
And, Sly?

183
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:35,289
The shirt's not gonna cut it.

184
00:06:39,694 --> 00:06:42,129
SYLVESTER:
<i>In 2013,</i>

185
00:06:42,131 --> 00:06:45,499
the Triumph Carnival fire
left 4,000 passengers

186
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:47,401
floating in the Gulf of Mexico.

187
00:06:47,403 --> 00:06:49,703
2012-- the Costa
Concordia tragedy.

188
00:06:49,705 --> 00:06:52,372
Not to mention a little film
starring Leonardo DiCaprio

189
00:06:52,374 --> 00:06:53,507
and a giant boat?
Okay.

190
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:55,442
We'll be in and
out in 20 minutes.

191
00:06:55,444 --> 00:06:56,910
Hello!
Hi! Welcome to Pacific

192
00:06:56,912 --> 00:06:58,178
West Cruises.

193
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,947
There are four of us.

194
00:07:01,282 --> 00:07:02,683
Mr. And Mrs. Bonesteel!

195
00:07:02,685 --> 00:07:04,084
Mm-hmm.

196
00:07:04,086 --> 00:07:06,553
We are thrilled
to welcome you aboard.

197
00:07:06,555 --> 00:07:07,621
Thrilled to be here.

198
00:07:07,623 --> 00:07:08,655
The VIP cocktail reception

199
00:07:08,657 --> 00:07:10,390
is on the Lido deck.

200
00:07:10,392 --> 00:07:11,758
Wonderful, we'll be
in our room, so...

201
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,926
No. We will do

202
00:07:12,928 --> 00:07:14,328
what we normally do, Chaz.

203
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,662
Where is the Lido deck?

204
00:07:15,664 --> 00:07:17,464
The Lido deck is the top deck.

205
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:19,833
Wonderful.
Top deck above it all.

206
00:07:19,835 --> 00:07:21,001
20 minutes.

207
00:07:21,003 --> 00:07:22,102
The clock starts now.

208
00:07:22,104 --> 00:07:24,271
Mm-hmm.

209
00:07:25,073 --> 00:07:27,241
Tickets?

210
00:07:27,243 --> 00:07:28,609
Ow!
(grunts)

211
00:07:31,546 --> 00:07:34,581
Took us substantially longer
to board than we estimated.

212
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,351
Blame the inefficient
cruise line.

213
00:07:37,353 --> 00:07:39,219
We still got
to locate the rockets,

214
00:07:39,221 --> 00:07:40,387
disarm them and
get off the ship.

215
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:41,688
And we're way behind.

216
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,023
Yeah. No, I'm working on it.

217
00:07:43,025 --> 00:07:45,859
My software can test whether

218
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:47,494
the rockets are reachable
across an IP network,

219
00:07:47,496 --> 00:07:50,364
thus creating a traceable ping
for lack of a better word.

220
00:07:50,366 --> 00:07:51,865
So, where the hell's the ping?

221
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:52,867
Give me a minute.

222
00:07:52,868 --> 00:07:55,902
(thud nearby)

223
00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:00,274
(shushes)
We've got company.

224
00:08:04,512 --> 00:08:06,380
Everything looks good.

225
00:08:06,382 --> 00:08:08,015
Pressure readouts are normal.

226
00:08:08,017 --> 00:08:09,583
I'll run a systems check
just to be safe.

227
00:08:09,585 --> 00:08:10,717
It'll just take a few minutes.

228
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:12,085
MAN:
Copy that.

229
00:08:12,087 --> 00:08:14,621
You're calculating this into
your 20 minutes, right?

230
00:08:14,623 --> 00:08:16,156
We're minutes
from the boat leaving.

231
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:17,758
Can't you, uh,

232
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,827
put him in a sleeper hold
or... something?

233
00:08:20,829 --> 00:08:24,398
Someone will find him and alert
the boat and the bad guys.

234
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,866
Just sit tight.

235
00:08:25,868 --> 00:08:27,901
Captain, we're
all clear down here.

236
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,102
Roger.

237
00:08:29,104 --> 00:08:30,137
CABE: See?

238
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:31,738
Patience.

239
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,308
Securing the bulkhead.

240
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,575
Walter?

241
00:08:35,577 --> 00:08:38,111
I don't like the sound of that.

242
00:08:38,113 --> 00:08:41,948
(alarm blaring)

243
00:08:43,518 --> 00:08:45,719
Whoa, whoa!
Hold on, hold...

244
00:08:48,556 --> 00:08:51,091
Can you get us out of here?

245
00:08:51,093 --> 00:08:52,793
Yeah, I can.

246
00:08:52,795 --> 00:08:54,528
But by the time I do,

247
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,931
we'll be in the middle
of the Pacific.

248
00:08:57,933 --> 00:08:59,666
(ship horn blows twice)
Paige!

249
00:08:59,668 --> 00:09:01,401
That was the "get off
the boat" noise.

250
00:09:01,403 --> 00:09:04,404
Where the hell are they?!

253
00:09:14,293 --> 00:09:16,428
SYLVESTER:
<i>Oh, this is not good!</i>

254
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,562
I am on a boat!

255
00:09:17,564 --> 00:09:18,697
In the middle of the ocean!

256
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:20,065
Have you seen the movie
<i>Open Water?!</i>

257
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:22,467
Those people were stranded
in shark-infested waters.

258
00:09:22,469 --> 00:09:23,568
You're on a luxury cruise boat.

259
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,237
Paige, I can't swim.

260
00:09:26,406 --> 00:09:28,140
Maybe you can't.

261
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:29,574
But Chaz Bonesteel can.

262
00:09:29,576 --> 00:09:30,675
In fact, Chaz Bonesteel

263
00:09:30,677 --> 00:09:31,977
is a champion swimmer.

264
00:09:31,979 --> 00:09:33,311
And Chaz Bonesteel

265
00:09:33,313 --> 00:09:35,514
can keep it together.

266
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,884
Come on, Walter,
I've seen you

267
00:09:38,886 --> 00:09:40,285
diffuse bombs faster than this.

268
00:09:40,287 --> 00:09:41,420
It's a simple door pane.

269
00:09:41,422 --> 00:09:43,789
I'm trying to open
the bulkhead door

270
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,624
without alerting anyone
that we're down here.

271
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,759
Can you give me a minute?

272
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:49,995
Please?

273
00:09:49,997 --> 00:09:51,229
(cell phone ringing)

274
00:09:51,231 --> 00:09:52,531
Oh, geez!

275
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:53,899
Ralph, are you okay?

276
00:09:53,901 --> 00:09:55,167
I think I'm sick.

277
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:57,836
Ms. Dineen, he has
the chills pretty bad.

278
00:09:57,838 --> 00:09:59,071
Teeth were actually chattering.

279
00:09:59,073 --> 00:10:01,239
PAIGE:
Okay, well, I'm a little...

280
00:10:01,241 --> 00:10:03,742
unavailable right now.

281
00:10:03,744 --> 00:10:05,677
Uh, I'll have to have
Toby and Happy pick you up.

282
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:07,446
All right, honey?

283
00:10:07,448 --> 00:10:08,547
Thanks, Mom.

284
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:10,082
I love you.

285
00:10:12,952 --> 00:10:15,687
Would Chaz be worried that
everything's going to hell?

286
00:10:18,825 --> 00:10:20,826
Appreciate it, nurse.

287
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,160
No problem.

288
00:10:22,162 --> 00:10:23,862
Feel better, Ralph.

289
00:10:23,864 --> 00:10:26,431
It's a bummer
you're feeling sick.

290
00:10:28,701 --> 00:10:30,368
You know, when you
get the chills,

291
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,537
it means your body's
fighting an infection.

292
00:10:40,613 --> 00:10:42,814
(school bell ringing)

293
00:10:53,693 --> 00:10:55,160
A knapsack full of ice packs

294
00:10:55,162 --> 00:10:56,728
to make your teeth chatter?

295
00:10:57,997 --> 00:11:00,065
I've seen you hack
a thermometer, Ralph.

296
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:01,233
This is amateur hour.

297
00:11:01,235 --> 00:11:03,835
I had limited resources.

298
00:11:07,673 --> 00:11:09,174
Where the hell
have you been?

299
00:11:09,176 --> 00:11:10,375
We're out to sea.

300
00:11:10,377 --> 00:11:11,776
What exactly is the plan here?

301
00:11:11,778 --> 00:11:13,178
Well, once we locate
and reprogram

302
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,814
the rockets, we'll ride on
to the first stop in Cancun.

303
00:11:15,816 --> 00:11:17,682
Homeland agents will meet us

304
00:11:17,684 --> 00:11:19,284
and get us across the border.

305
00:11:19,286 --> 00:11:21,019
My God, the kid's green.

306
00:11:21,021 --> 00:11:22,521
WALTER:
Okay, let's all

307
00:11:22,523 --> 00:11:23,822
get our comms in.

308
00:11:23,824 --> 00:11:25,290
Link them up, come on.

309
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:26,958
I'm gonna call Happy, make
sure that she's connected.

310
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,628
This whole thing has not
gone according to plan,

311
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,363
so we need to make sure
that we stay

312
00:11:31,365 --> 00:11:32,564
in constant communication.

313
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,332
CABE:
All right.

314
00:11:34,334 --> 00:11:36,234
Listen, keep an eye
on the kid.

315
00:11:36,236 --> 00:11:38,136
Get him to lie down or
something, and whatever you do,

316
00:11:38,138 --> 00:11:40,438
don't leave this room
and don't talk to anyone.

317
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,207
I'm gonna call Happy,

318
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:45,443
find out why it was so difficult
to get a signal in the hull.

319
00:11:45,445 --> 00:11:46,611
Keep you posted.

320
00:11:46,613 --> 00:11:48,293
(knocking)
CAPTAIN: Mr. and Mrs. Bonesteel?

321
00:11:48,915 --> 00:11:51,950
Paige, come answer it.

322
00:11:55,688 --> 00:11:57,522
Yes?
Mrs. Bonesteel.

323
00:11:57,524 --> 00:11:58,657
I'm Captain Steven Caine.

324
00:11:58,659 --> 00:11:59,691
Welcome aboard.

325
00:11:59,693 --> 00:12:01,159
I wanted to personally
invite you

326
00:12:01,161 --> 00:12:03,161
and Mr. Bonesteel to join me
at my table for lunch.

327
00:12:03,163 --> 00:12:05,096
Oh, the captain's table,
that sounds lovely.

328
00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:06,231
Wonderful.

329
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:07,599
Many people are very excited

330
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,000
about dining with Mr. Bonesteel.

331
00:12:09,936 --> 00:12:11,236
Good, now I have to have lunch.

332
00:12:11,238 --> 00:12:13,104
Hm.

333
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,241
WALTER:
<i>Okay, so we meet back</i>

334
00:12:16,243 --> 00:12:18,176
at the room after our
respective missions, okay?

335
00:12:18,178 --> 00:12:19,981
And, uh, Sly, please, uh,

336
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:22,121
WOMAN: Walter?
try to lay off the Dramamine.

337
00:12:22,148 --> 00:12:23,415
That's an ex.

338
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:24,716
Handle it fast.

339
00:12:24,718 --> 00:12:25,718
Hey.

340
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:27,986
Are you working on the ship?

341
00:12:27,988 --> 00:12:29,221
Um, yes.

342
00:12:29,223 --> 00:12:31,790
I am, uh, currently,
uh, working.

343
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,859
Tech support on a cruise
is a nice step up.

344
00:12:34,861 --> 00:12:36,194
Well, you know what they say.

345
00:12:36,196 --> 00:12:37,963
Onward and upward.

346
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,632
Walter, we are going to lunch.

347
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,501
Meet my dad at the shuffleboard.

348
00:12:43,503 --> 00:12:45,237
Okay.

349
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:46,605
Is that woman the waitress?

350
00:12:46,607 --> 00:12:49,507
From that diner
you used to take me to?

351
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:51,476
Yes, she did, uh,

352
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:53,712
work there for a while.

353
00:12:53,714 --> 00:12:54,846
So she's here with you?

354
00:12:54,848 --> 00:12:55,947
Are-are you two dating?

355
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:58,083
No, we work together.

356
00:12:58,985 --> 00:13:01,286
Oh, the waitress
is a tech expert, too.

357
00:13:01,288 --> 00:13:02,654
Come on, Walter.

358
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,856
No, you don't understand.

359
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:06,591
The truth is

360
00:13:06,593 --> 00:13:09,327
(whispering):
we work for the government.

361
00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:11,596
The government?

362
00:13:11,598 --> 00:13:12,998
You expect me to believe that?

363
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,600
MAN:
Janice!

364
00:13:15,602 --> 00:13:17,202
Come here; there-s someone
I want you to meet.

365
00:13:17,204 --> 00:13:18,536
My fiancé.

366
00:13:20,306 --> 00:13:23,541
Enjoy the cruise, Walt.

367
00:13:31,884 --> 00:13:34,119
Happy, the signal's
still jumping around.

368
00:13:34,121 --> 00:13:36,788
The girders are
just steel alloy.

369
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,223
They shouldn't be interfering
with the signal.

370
00:13:38,225 --> 00:13:40,558
Yeah, well, I'm down here,
and I'm telling you,

371
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,760
I can't get a proper signal.

372
00:13:41,762 --> 00:13:42,827
Calm down. I'm trying to find

373
00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:43,862
an answer.

374
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,231
Excuse me, I am perfectly calm.

375
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:47,232
Yeah, you sound perfectly calm.

376
00:13:47,234 --> 00:13:48,800
Enough.

377
00:13:48,802 --> 00:13:50,135
This thing's echoing in my ear

378
00:13:50,137 --> 00:13:51,569
from you two acting
like children.

379
00:13:51,571 --> 00:13:53,238
Get it together.

380
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,440
Echo?

381
00:13:56,242 --> 00:13:57,942
Wait.

382
00:13:57,944 --> 00:13:59,177
That's it, Walt.

383
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:00,545
There's got to be a hollow space

384
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:01,980
located in the hull somewhere

385
00:14:01,982 --> 00:14:04,182
that's causing the signal
to bounce around like an echo

386
00:14:04,184 --> 00:14:05,583
whenever the boat swells.

387
00:14:05,585 --> 00:14:07,552
Yes, there should be
a crawlspace above you.

388
00:14:07,554 --> 00:14:09,020
Eight, maybe ten feet up?

389
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:10,355
Oh, oh.

390
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,695
Oh, yeah, I see it.
Hold that.

391
00:14:18,664 --> 00:14:20,465
Yeah, they're here.

392
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:23,868
Hand it to me.

393
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,071
Oh, Cabe, Happy was right.

394
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,606
They're here.

395
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:30,742
Thank you.

396
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,478
Enjoy.

397
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,579
Mr. Bonesteel,

398
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:36,348
I read the article
where you mentioned

399
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,250
seared frog legs were
a particular favorite of yours.

400
00:14:40,152 --> 00:14:42,420
So I had some flown in.
Here you are.

401
00:14:43,422 --> 00:14:45,190
PAIGE:
Oh.

402
00:14:46,025 --> 00:14:47,525
Chaz just...

403
00:14:47,527 --> 00:14:49,394
loves his amphibious meats.

404
00:14:49,396 --> 00:14:51,896
(clears throat)

405
00:14:53,366 --> 00:14:55,233
Thank you.

406
00:14:57,069 --> 00:14:59,371
(clears throat)

407
00:15:01,807 --> 00:15:03,007
You almost done?

408
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:05,276
I'm only a few minutes in.

409
00:15:06,812 --> 00:15:08,113
Besides, it's dark in here.

410
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,614
You got 197 IQ,

411
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:11,549
and you don't know how
to operate a flashlight?

412
00:15:11,551 --> 00:15:12,851
Are you kidding me?

413
00:15:12,853 --> 00:15:15,086
(gun clicks)
Who are you?

414
00:15:15,821 --> 00:15:18,590
Just a little lost.

415
00:15:18,592 --> 00:15:20,325
Lost, huh?

416
00:15:20,327 --> 00:15:21,659
Down here in the cargo hold?

417
00:15:21,661 --> 00:15:22,694
Turn around.

418
00:15:22,696 --> 00:15:24,929
On your knees now.

419
00:15:24,931 --> 00:15:27,899
Okay, okay.

420
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:30,902
Don't move.

421
00:15:33,572 --> 00:15:36,007
Who you working for?

422
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,577
I said, who do you work for?

423
00:15:41,447 --> 00:15:43,148
I'm not gonna ask you again.

424
00:15:49,922 --> 00:15:51,723
(grunting)

425
00:15:56,362 --> 00:15:57,328
Damn it.

426
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,396
Our cover's blown.

427
00:15:58,398 --> 00:15:59,798
In a few minutes,

428
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,800
whoever he's working for

429
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:02,200
is gonna be looking for us.

430
00:16:02,202 --> 00:16:03,468
Oh, we don't have enough time.

431
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,703
Forget about
installing the GPS.

432
00:16:05,705 --> 00:16:08,006
Just deactivate
the damn things.

433
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,307
Grab them and go.

434
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:11,776
Chaz, when did you know

435
00:16:11,778 --> 00:16:13,611
that you'd made it?

436
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:18,450
(clears throat)

437
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:21,619
Tell them the story...

438
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:23,121
Chaz.

439
00:16:23,123 --> 00:16:25,490
Well...

440
00:16:27,293 --> 00:16:29,894
My grandfather
once took me ice fishing.

441
00:16:29,896 --> 00:16:32,864
And we dropped our lines
and we waited,

442
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,133
but I was impatient.

443
00:16:38,471 --> 00:16:40,205
So I said to my grandfather,

444
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,273
"Grandfather,

445
00:16:42,275 --> 00:16:45,176
my feet are frozen and I'd like
to go home, please."

446
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:46,678
(chuckles)

447
00:16:49,315 --> 00:16:51,950
And he said, "Son, grandson,

448
00:16:51,952 --> 00:16:54,452
"when your feet are frozen,

449
00:16:54,454 --> 00:16:57,422
"that is when the fish

450
00:16:57,424 --> 00:16:59,524
are the warmest."

451
00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:04,662
MAN:
Excuse me, Captain.

452
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:10,635
If you'll all excuse me,
I have a call I have to take.

453
00:17:12,972 --> 00:17:14,706
SERVER: Excuse me, sir,
your next course.

454
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,408
Oh.

455
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,577
Escargot.

456
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:22,780
Oh, that's a lot of snails.

457
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:24,516
Please, no.

458
00:17:24,518 --> 00:17:27,051
There's some light over here.

459
00:17:27,053 --> 00:17:28,853
Here, hold that.

460
00:17:28,855 --> 00:17:31,289
Yeah.

461
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,024
Hurry up.

462
00:17:33,026 --> 00:17:35,260
(engines whining)

463
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,461
This is your captain.

464
00:17:36,463 --> 00:17:37,962
All passengers
report immediately

465
00:17:37,964 --> 00:17:39,430
to the casino on the main deck.
No, that's not good.

466
00:17:39,432 --> 00:17:41,232
Thank you.
Put the ship into idle.

467
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:42,634
That's no coincidence.

468
00:17:42,636 --> 00:17:43,868
They can't find us,

469
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,503
so they're going
after the passengers.

470
00:17:46,572 --> 00:17:47,672
Please, keep coming in.

471
00:17:47,674 --> 00:17:49,574
Yes, that's it.
Just this way, folks.

472
00:17:49,576 --> 00:17:50,742
That's right, right in here.
Do you think

473
00:17:50,744 --> 00:17:52,410
Chaz would find this odd?

474
00:17:52,412 --> 00:17:54,445
Not sure, but I certainly do.

475
00:17:54,447 --> 00:17:55,713
CAPTAIN:
Plenty of room.

476
00:17:55,715 --> 00:17:57,549
Please, please keep coming.
That's it.

477
00:17:57,551 --> 00:17:59,484
Yes, ma'am. Yes, I know.
Make your way

478
00:17:59,486 --> 00:18:02,654
to the back of the room. There
is plenty of space for everyone.

479
00:18:02,656 --> 00:18:04,088
All is fine,
nothing to worry about.

480
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,290
I'm feeling very
strange about this.

481
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,792
PAIGE: They don't look
like ship security.

482
00:18:07,794 --> 00:18:09,494
SYLVESTER:
Why are they blocking the doors?

483
00:18:09,496 --> 00:18:11,696
(doors close)
All right, everyone, please,

484
00:18:11,698 --> 00:18:12,864
do not panic.

485
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:14,933
Everything is going to be
absolutely fine.

486
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:16,234
(groans, passengers scream)

487
00:18:18,737 --> 00:18:20,939
Thank you, Captain.

488
00:18:23,042 --> 00:18:24,709
I'll take it from here.

489
00:18:24,711 --> 00:18:26,210
(gun clicks)

490
00:18:26,212 --> 00:18:27,512
(gasping)

491
00:18:27,514 --> 00:18:28,680
Ladies and gentlemen,

492
00:18:28,682 --> 00:18:30,748
if you want to live,

493
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,984
there's one thing
that you need to understand.

494
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,019
Oh, my God.

495
00:18:35,021 --> 00:18:36,788
This is my ship now.

496
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,081
Hurry up.

497
00:18:48,445 --> 00:18:50,229
HENCHMAN:
Electronic devices in the bag.

498
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,896
In the bag.

499
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,532
HENCHMAN 2:
We searched the ship.

500
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:56,033
This is everyone on board.

501
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:58,002
I looked for the rockets;
they're not where we left them.

502
00:18:58,004 --> 00:18:59,537
Cell phone in the bag!

503
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:00,705
Cell phone in the bag now, lady!

504
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:02,139
(gunshots)

505
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,210
Do I have everyone's attention?

506
00:19:11,616 --> 00:19:13,417
One of you knows
where my cargo is.

507
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,753
I intend to get it back.

508
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:19,490
This is a passenger manifest.

509
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,791
So,

510
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,660
if you cannot produce
an identification

511
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,395
that's on this list,

512
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,497
well then,

513
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,866
today is not your lucky day.

514
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,234
Roger that, sir.

515
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:31,736
We'll be prepared.

516
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:35,539
Navy's sending a military copter
to handle the hostage situation.

517
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,741
They're linking up our comms,

518
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:38,309
but if those goons find us,
they can't

519
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:40,010
have live rockets with
helicopters approaching.

520
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,378
I'm almost done.

521
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,715
Walter, where are you?

522
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,450
We got caught in the bowels
of the ship.

523
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:47,585
Why? What's going on?

524
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:48,753
We are in the casino.

525
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:50,254
Christoph is reading
the manifest,

526
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:51,722
and once he gets to Bonesteel,

527
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,557
we are in big trouble.

528
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,093
The laminate that Happy used
on both of our I.D.'s

529
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:58,796
is only a few hours old,
and if he shines a light on it,

530
00:19:58,798 --> 00:19:59,730
it'll read as fake.

531
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:00,732
Time frame?

532
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,299
Well, okay, statistically,

533
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,602
B is the fifth most common start
to a surname,

534
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:05,703
and A is the twelfth.

535
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,538
How much time, Sylvester?

536
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,473
Okay, three minutes, tops.

537
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,408
New plan.

538
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,377
You have to finish disarming
the rockets first.

539
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,712
We don't have enough time.

540
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,147
The rockets will take
another four minutes.

541
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:18,315
Paige and Sylvester
will be dead in three.

542
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,118
What the hell do we do?

543
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,521
Grab me a beer.

544
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:25,990
I have an idea.

545
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,828
RALPH: <i>I wanted to give Sloan</i>
<i>a valentine,</i>

546
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,363
but Jason gave her one first.

547
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:34,465
Ralphie boy,
you got to be persistent.

548
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,467
There are some girls
who don't know a good thin

549
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,002
when it's right
in front of them,

550
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:40,738
no matter how many times
it has been offered.

551
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:45,242
You and Sloan are friends,
right, Ralph?

552
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,077
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

553
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,246
HAPPY:
Well, maybe

554
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,315
she doesn't want
to jeopardize your friendship.

555
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:52,983
Maybe

556
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,753
she's never had a best friend
like you before

557
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,222
and that probably
means a lot to her.

558
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,325
So don't take it personally.

559
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:02,827
You just have to be patient.

560
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:03,894
How patient?
Like, if you had

561
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:05,429
to put a time frame on it.

562
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:08,732
I really don't know what
we're talking about anymore.

563
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,004
(phone ringing)

564
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,143
Talk to me.

565
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:20,744
WALTER:
We have a situation here.

566
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,180
All the passengers
have been taken hostage,

567
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:24,481
including Paige and Sylvester.

568
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,317
So I need you to find a spot

569
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,219
in the hull

570
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:30,588
where I can access
the ship's intercom.

571
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:35,860
Okay, I'm in the ship's
broadcasting system.

572
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:37,294
What are you up to?

573
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,929
There's no intercom down here,

574
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:40,231
so I'm building one.

575
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:42,466
If we're gonna negotiate
with our captors,

576
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,001
we have to able
to talk to them first.

577
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:46,103
Grab that;
let's go.

578
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:47,638
HAPPY:
It should be on your left side.

579
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,640
Here it is, here it is.

580
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,641
(grunts)

581
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,775
Ah, thank you, Happy.

582
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:54,545
Once we get
a current,

583
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:57,882
the can will act
as a microphone.

584
00:21:57,884 --> 00:22:00,050
I'll have it broadcast
over every speaker

585
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,419
on the ship.
Watch yourself.

586
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:05,389
SYLVESTER: Okay, Walter, you have
approximately 30 seconds

587
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:07,558
until they call Bonesteel.

588
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,361
They will kill
me and Paige.

589
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:12,796
You sure
about this?

590
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,031
There's no hiding
once it's done.

591
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,666
We have no choice.

592
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,002
Barclay, Phineas.

593
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:22,306
What are we going to do?

594
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:24,108
When he sees our IDs,

595
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,910
he'll know that they're bogus.

596
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:28,012
CHRISTOPH:
Bonesteel...

597
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,147
Alissa.

598
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:37,821
Alissa Bonesteel.

599
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:40,658
Just stay right here, okay?

600
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:44,395
It's okay, come here.

601
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:47,164
Ow!

602
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,366
CHRISTOPH:
I will put a bullet

603
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,136
in her ponytail

604
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:54,538
if Ms. Alissa Bonesteel
does not step forward.

605
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,973
I am!

606
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:59,076
I... I am...

607
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:01,045
Alissa Bonesteel.

608
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,913
(whimpers)

609
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,251
Trouble hearing?

610
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:09,320
No, I...

611
00:23:09,322 --> 00:23:10,688
I'm just scared

612
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,890
because I left
my ID in my room.

613
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:20,064
(gasps)

614
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,600
I'm gonna take
a wild guess

615
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,369
that you know where my cargo is.

616
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:30,240
PAIGE:
I don't know.

617
00:23:32,877 --> 00:23:34,378
I don't know--
No, please, please.

618
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,914
I have a son.

619
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,349
CHRISTOPH:
In three seconds.

620
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:40,317
your son will
have no mother.

621
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,518
And then...
(whimpers)

622
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,020
...I'm gonna pay him a visit.
No...

623
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:44,888
WALTER (over intercom):
Release the hostages

624
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,124
or I throw your rockets
overboard.

625
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:48,659
(passengers murmuring)

626
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:50,294
Are you kidding me?

627
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,631
All right,
come on.

628
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,107
Yes, this is the man
you stole from.

629
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,208
Who's this, please?

630
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,610
My name is not important;
what I have is.

631
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:09,380
Correct.

632
00:24:09,382 --> 00:24:12,950
But what I have is
even more precious.

633
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:16,920
And I will kill them,

634
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,389
one by one,

635
00:24:18,391 --> 00:24:20,157
unless you bring me my weapons

636
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,658
immediately.

637
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,194
(quietly):
You give him those rockets

638
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:27,164
and he'll shoot that rescue
copter right out of the sky.

639
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,566
Happy?

640
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,368
There has to be
another vessel nearby.

641
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,971
Can you locate anything?
I'm looking.

642
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:37,074
You have five seconds to comply.

643
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:37,941
Hurry, Happy.

644
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,610
Five...

645
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:41,979
four...
No...

646
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,814
A Japanese destroyer
isn't too far away.

647
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:44,882
Three...

648
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:46,284
Hack the destroyer's
control system.

649
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:47,584
Two...

650
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:48,952
one.

651
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,220
WOMAN:
No, no, no, no....

652
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:51,989
WALTER:
Okay, okay, okay! You win.

653
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,457
Lido deck, five minutes,

654
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:54,725
with the rockets.

655
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:56,193
Perfect.

656
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:57,694
Grab the captain.
You...

657
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,363
take Tennille.

658
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:01,565
Let's go.

659
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:02,800
PILOT (over comms):
Navy 6-4.

660
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:03,867
Four minutes out and closing.

661
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,670
Okay, hold...

662
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,276
WALTER:
Okay.

663
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:13,343
Okay, okay.

664
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,211
That's close enough.

665
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:17,181
Or they go
overboard.

666
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,685
Can I have my
rockets now, please?

667
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:24,521
Give me your word
you'll let the passengers go.

668
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:29,960
You see this gun?

669
00:25:29,962 --> 00:25:31,595
It's got a sensitive trigger.

670
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:34,031
Sometimes it goes off

671
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,499
when I've barely
even touched it.

672
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:38,068
You guys want to see?

673
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,236
No, no, no.

674
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:40,871
No, no.

675
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,207
Okay.

676
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:46,076
Put the gun down.

677
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:47,111
Thank you.

678
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:48,278
Search them.

679
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:57,721
Raul's.

680
00:26:02,293 --> 00:26:04,528
I'm sorry, who are
you two guys working for?

681
00:26:07,031 --> 00:26:09,500
Nothing?

682
00:26:09,502 --> 00:26:10,767
(grunts)
Hey!

683
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,803
(coughing)

684
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:14,104
(feedback whines)
Oh.

685
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:16,440
Oh.

686
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:18,642
Who have you been talking to?

687
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,845
PILOT (over comms):
This is Navy 6-2.

688
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:24,381
We are five miles out, roughly
two minutes to intercept.

689
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:26,517
Are we clear to approach,
Agent Gallo? Over.

690
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:31,355
Tell them everything is fine.

691
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:32,689
PILOT:
Repeat. Are we clear to land?

692
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:33,891
Over.

693
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:39,062
CABE:
Okay. Okay.

694
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:41,765
This is Agent Cabe Gallo.

695
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,600
You're clear to approach.

696
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,235
Good job.

697
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:46,170
Take 'em over there.

698
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:48,238
Move!
Go, go! To the rail.

699
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,474
You all right?
To the rail. Now, now. Move it.

700
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,579
Now for the fireworks.

701
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,658
Booyah!

702
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:18,130
We got painted! Single rocket
tracking us now! Slice right!

703
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,006
Verona, this is Romeo.
We have been engaged.

704
00:27:21,491 --> 00:27:23,091
Chopper's
five miles out,

705
00:27:23,093 --> 00:27:24,559
give them standard
approach speed...

706
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:26,228
impact in 90 seconds.

707
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:31,466
You ever been scuba diving?

708
00:27:43,613 --> 00:27:44,846
(Cabe grunts)

709
00:27:45,481 --> 00:27:46,381
CHRISTOPH:
Come on!

710
00:27:46,383 --> 00:27:47,515
What are you
standing around for?

711
00:27:47,517 --> 00:27:49,184
Get them!

712
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:53,989
Okay. We gotta get
in touch with Happy.

713
00:27:54,991 --> 00:27:57,626
Happy, have you hacked
into that destroyer yet?

714
00:27:57,628 --> 00:27:59,828
How much time we got?
45 seconds.

715
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,830
We got 45 seconds
until that rocket

716
00:28:01,832 --> 00:28:03,498
takes out a U.S.
military helicopter.

717
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,767
Thank you for filling me in
on the stakes now.

718
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:06,901
We're in the ship's
weapons system,

719
00:28:06,903 --> 00:28:08,136
but we need more time.

720
00:28:08,138 --> 00:28:09,337
The Japanese are alerted

721
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:10,438
to our Trojan horse entry,

722
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,040
and they're
throwing up firewalls.

723
00:28:12,042 --> 00:28:13,108
We can't hack like Walter!

724
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,376
CABE:
Just figure something out.

725
00:28:16,045 --> 00:28:17,979
PILOT:
<i>Rocket closing.</i>

726
00:28:17,981 --> 00:28:19,814
1.8 miles.
Alter our vector!

727
00:28:19,816 --> 00:28:21,416
CABE:
<i>This is Agent Cabe Gallo.</i>

728
00:28:21,418 --> 00:28:23,318
If you want to live
to tell this war story,

729
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,886
do exactly as I say.

730
00:28:24,888 --> 00:28:26,388
We only have 30 seconds.

731
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,290
There's no time
for evasive maneuvers.

732
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:29,791
Hold your course.

733
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:30,892
Do nothing?

734
00:28:30,894 --> 00:28:32,394
CABE:
The less you move,

735
00:28:32,396 --> 00:28:33,561
the less the rocket moves.

736
00:28:33,563 --> 00:28:34,596
We're gonna intercept it.

737
00:28:34,598 --> 00:28:35,797
Using what?!

738
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:37,899
(alarms blaring)

739
00:28:37,901 --> 00:28:40,101
(speaking Japanese)

740
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:49,711
Wow, you picked a hell of
a day to ditch school, kid.

741
00:28:52,081 --> 00:28:53,682
(missile launching)

742
00:28:55,685 --> 00:28:58,086
CABE: Maintain your position,
lieutenant!

743
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:04,626
Lieutenant...

744
00:29:05,861 --> 00:29:08,129
Talk to me, guys.

745
00:29:08,131 --> 00:29:09,397
We're good.

746
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:10,532
We're alive.

747
00:29:10,534 --> 00:29:12,767
Can't say the same
for our fuel line, though.

748
00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:14,869
We shook up pretty bad.

749
00:29:14,871 --> 00:29:15,904
We're pouring gas.

750
00:29:15,906 --> 00:29:17,138
No chance we could
make it to you.

751
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,741
Better come up with
a plan "B," Walter.

752
00:29:21,911 --> 00:29:24,346
How about a plan "C"?

753
00:29:25,648 --> 00:29:26,681
THUG:
Go, go, go.

754
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:27,649
WALTER:
Okay.

755
00:29:27,651 --> 00:29:29,084
CHRISTOPH:
Here they are!

756
00:29:29,086 --> 00:29:31,820
The men who cause us
nothing but trouble.

757
00:29:31,822 --> 00:29:34,489
In a few moments, the Navy's
gonna send another helo,

758
00:29:34,491 --> 00:29:37,325
so... you can tell me

759
00:29:37,327 --> 00:29:39,394
what agencies
you work for,

760
00:29:39,396 --> 00:29:41,329
or you guys are going
into the sea.

761
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,533
Well...

762
00:29:46,669 --> 00:29:48,937
Yeah, we're, uh...

763
00:29:48,939 --> 00:29:50,271
we're here working with...

764
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:54,008
(grunting)

765
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:02,517
Freeze! Hold it!

766
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:04,886
Hold it!
Hold it right there!

767
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:05,888
Good work.

768
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:07,255
Give me the gun

769
00:30:07,257 --> 00:30:08,156
and we'll put 'em in the hold.

770
00:30:08,158 --> 00:30:10,058
Not exactly, Agent.
Hey.

771
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:16,998
You're with Christoph.

772
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,533
No...

773
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,504
...he is Christoph.

774
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:25,006
Licensed captain,

775
00:30:25,008 --> 00:30:26,508
legitimate
commercial vessel,

776
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:29,277
minimal customs issues compared
to big cruise liners...

777
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,745
It's perfect front
for big weapons.

778
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:31,747
Yes.

779
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:33,548
It surely was.

780
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,049
Raul.

781
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:36,084
We've wasted
enough time.

782
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:38,353
We need to get these rockets
off the ship.

783
00:30:38,355 --> 00:30:39,320
Grab the girl,

784
00:30:39,322 --> 00:30:40,755
meet me on the lower deck.

785
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:44,426
Move!
(screams)

786
00:30:44,428 --> 00:30:45,493
Come with me.

787
00:30:45,495 --> 00:30:47,328
Hey! Hey. Take me. Take me.
Hey!

788
00:30:48,197 --> 00:30:49,898
(passengers screaming)

789
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,299
Don't move.

790
00:30:51,301 --> 00:30:53,001
Let's go.

791
00:30:59,542 --> 00:31:01,075
(passengers exclaiming,
shouting)

792
00:31:01,077 --> 00:31:03,611
WOMAN 1:
Hey! Get us out of here!

793
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:04,813
(indistinct shouting)

794
00:31:04,815 --> 00:31:06,047
MAN:
What's going on?

795
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:07,081
Okay.

796
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:08,316
MAN 2:
We can't get out.

797
00:31:08,318 --> 00:31:09,484
MAN:
Wait, wait...

798
00:31:09,486 --> 00:31:11,653
All right, okay.

799
00:31:16,325 --> 00:31:18,293
Hold this.
What the hell are you doing?

800
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:20,862
Chaz Bonesteel
ain't going out like this.

801
00:31:21,831 --> 00:31:23,698
(groans)

802
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,967
Okay.

803
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:28,603
Come on, Bonesteel.
Come on, Bonesteel.

804
00:31:28,605 --> 00:31:30,638
(panting):
Okay.

805
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,981
I'm gonna need a boost.

806
00:31:40,749 --> 00:31:42,050
PAIGE: Please, no.
MAN: Come on.

807
00:31:42,052 --> 00:31:43,284
Please, no.
Let's go!

808
00:31:43,286 --> 00:31:44,586
Get her in the raft.
Come on!

809
00:31:44,588 --> 00:31:45,820
We got to move fast.
No.

810
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:48,389
Please, please.
Let's go!

811
00:31:48,391 --> 00:31:50,358
Hold on, hold on.
You want to guarantee

812
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,594
they don't blow you out
of the water? Take me.

813
00:31:52,596 --> 00:31:53,728
Why is that?

814
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,530
I'm a high-value
government asset.

815
00:31:55,532 --> 00:31:56,664
You take me,

816
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:58,266
you'll have
a fighting chance.

817
00:31:58,268 --> 00:31:59,501
Let her go.

818
00:31:59,503 --> 00:32:01,469
Walter, don't.

819
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:05,273
Right. Get on.

820
00:32:05,275 --> 00:32:07,108
No!

821
00:32:08,644 --> 00:32:10,812
MAN: Let's go!
Walter.

822
00:32:16,452 --> 00:32:18,186
CAINE:
Let's go.

823
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:30,431
(grunting, panting)

824
00:32:30,433 --> 00:32:32,834
CAINE (in distance):
Come on. Move it!

825
00:32:46,982 --> 00:32:50,385
You can do this.
You can do this.

826
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:52,487
(grunting)

827
00:32:55,658 --> 00:32:58,393
Bonesteel!

828
00:33:09,091 --> 00:33:10,959
Wha...?

829
00:33:10,961 --> 00:33:12,794
(brief burst of gunfire)

830
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,733
WALTER:
Sly, where are you?

831
00:33:17,735 --> 00:33:20,703
Ah, I... I'm tangled
in the rope.

832
00:33:20,705 --> 00:33:21,937
I can't get free.

833
00:33:23,573 --> 00:33:25,813
SYLVESTER: It's dragging me
back. It's dragging me under.

834
00:33:31,514 --> 00:33:34,116
Oh, God.

835
00:33:34,118 --> 00:33:35,551
Walter.

836
00:33:35,553 --> 00:33:37,987
Walter, the suction from the
propeller is pulling me in.

837
00:33:37,989 --> 00:33:39,955
It's too strong.
Hold on, buddy.

838
00:33:39,957 --> 00:33:41,790
Hold on!
Walter?

839
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:43,692
Walter.
Sylvester!

840
00:33:43,694 --> 00:33:44,893
You got to find the crew.

841
00:33:44,895 --> 00:33:46,528
They need to shut off
the propeller.

842
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:48,831
The crew's...

843
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:50,366
locked up.

844
00:33:50,368 --> 00:33:52,468
Happy, I'm gonna need your help.

845
00:33:53,637 --> 00:33:56,805
WALTER:
Cabe! Cabe, where are you?

846
00:34:01,211 --> 00:34:02,544
Cabe!

847
00:34:02,546 --> 00:34:03,712
Cabe, Sylvester!

848
00:34:03,714 --> 00:34:05,281
Here! Grab my hand.

849
00:34:05,283 --> 00:34:07,516
Walter, it's pulling too strong.
Cabe, don't let me go.

850
00:34:07,518 --> 00:34:10,052
Hold on, kid! Grab my hand!
Don't let me go.

851
00:34:10,054 --> 00:34:11,153
Happy, I'm here.

852
00:34:11,155 --> 00:34:12,821
HAPPY: Okay, take
the throttles out of gear.

853
00:34:12,823 --> 00:34:14,990
The control handles are in
the middle of the panel.

854
00:34:14,992 --> 00:34:16,492
(sighs)
Okay, I see them.

855
00:34:16,494 --> 00:34:18,927
Push them both down toward you.

856
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:20,329
CABE:
Hold on, kid!

857
00:34:20,331 --> 00:34:22,498
I don't think I'm gonna make it.
Hold on!

858
00:34:23,566 --> 00:34:24,533
It's not working.

859
00:34:24,535 --> 00:34:25,734
HAPPY:
Okay, you need to pull

860
00:34:25,736 --> 00:34:26,869
the manual diesel kill switch.

861
00:34:26,871 --> 00:34:28,170
There should be a handle
on the floor somewhere.

862
00:34:28,172 --> 00:34:30,706
Oh, I see it. Okay.

863
00:34:33,443 --> 00:34:34,443
WALTER:
Don't let go!

864
00:34:34,445 --> 00:34:35,477
Come on.

865
00:34:35,479 --> 00:34:36,812
(grunting)

866
00:34:38,848 --> 00:34:41,083
(sighs)
Thank God.

867
00:34:41,085 --> 00:34:43,018
I got it.

868
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,087
It worked.

869
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:46,588
CABE:
Take a breath, kid.

870
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,890
Everything's gonna
be okay, pal.

871
00:34:47,892 --> 00:34:49,425
(Sylvester panting)

872
00:34:49,427 --> 00:34:52,127
Take it easy.
Take it easy.

873
00:34:52,129 --> 00:34:54,697
SYLVESTER:
Cabe, watch out! (gasping)

874
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:55,964
You really screwed this up.

875
00:34:55,966 --> 00:34:59,068
The people I promised
those rockets to--

876
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:02,071
they're gonna take my life,
so I'm gonna take yours.

877
00:35:02,073 --> 00:35:05,240
(ship's horn blowing)

878
00:35:10,413 --> 00:35:12,247
WALTER: No, you got it.
You got it.

879
00:35:12,249 --> 00:35:14,416
Was I right about boats?
Yeah, probably.

880
00:35:14,418 --> 00:35:16,251
I was right about boats.
Yeah. Okay.

881
00:35:16,253 --> 00:35:17,753
Yeah, you're
right. Yeah.

882
00:35:17,755 --> 00:35:19,588
(grunting)
Okay.

883
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,824
PAIGE: <i>Yeah, we had</i>
<i>an interesting day.</i>

884
00:35:21,826 --> 00:35:23,359
<i>We were on a</i>

885
00:35:23,361 --> 00:35:25,461
big, beautiful
cruise ship, and, uh...

886
00:35:25,463 --> 00:35:27,563
so, um...

887
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:31,166
So you really do work
for the government.

888
00:35:31,168 --> 00:35:32,735
Yep.

889
00:35:32,737 --> 00:35:36,538
I, uh... always did
tell you the truth,

890
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,240
so, um...

891
00:35:38,242 --> 00:35:41,210
I was wondering if you
could tell me the truth.

892
00:35:41,212 --> 00:35:43,312
What could I do better

893
00:35:43,314 --> 00:35:46,515
so that Th-the mistakes
that I made with you...

894
00:35:46,517 --> 00:35:49,284
that I-I don't make them again?

895
00:35:49,286 --> 00:35:51,620
You are who you are.

896
00:35:51,622 --> 00:35:53,122
But you're challenging

897
00:35:53,124 --> 00:35:55,858
and sometimes
impossible because

898
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,827
no woman can stimulate
that mind of yours forever.

899
00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:00,429
If you want honesty...

900
00:36:02,732 --> 00:36:05,834
...after a while,
you lost interest in me--

901
00:36:05,836 --> 00:36:08,971
I could tell-- and that hurt.

902
00:36:10,173 --> 00:36:12,307
Oh.

903
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:14,910
I'm sorry.

904
00:36:15,879 --> 00:36:18,781
There's no malice in you,
Walter.

905
00:36:18,783 --> 00:36:20,816
Just facts.

906
00:36:20,818 --> 00:36:23,385
And, um...

907
00:36:23,387 --> 00:36:24,953
Things didn't go
exactly like we planned.

908
00:36:24,955 --> 00:36:27,156
...the fact is,

909
00:36:27,158 --> 00:36:29,792
before you get involved
with someone else,

910
00:36:29,794 --> 00:36:32,761
make sure you can
make a real connection.

911
00:36:32,763 --> 00:36:34,763
It wouldn't be fair
to her otherwise.

912
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,134
Take care of yourself.

913
00:36:46,543 --> 00:36:48,277
Mm-hmm.

914
00:36:52,415 --> 00:36:54,917
(sighs)
You ready, Ralph?

915
00:36:54,919 --> 00:36:57,719
Once I start this fire,
there's no putting it out.

916
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,293
Back up. Let's go.
Come on.

917
00:37:14,904 --> 00:37:16,271
And...

918
00:37:16,273 --> 00:37:17,673
there's the money.

919
00:37:21,044 --> 00:37:23,412
Where's the lucky lady?

920
00:37:24,948 --> 00:37:26,648
Well, I'm breaking
about 12 laws right now,

921
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:29,518
so I suggest you talk to her
while you can.

922
00:37:37,861 --> 00:37:39,895
I'm gonna seal the deal
for the kid.

923
00:37:39,897 --> 00:37:41,730
(whooshing)

924
00:37:42,832 --> 00:37:45,434
TOBY:
Ah, crap.

925
00:37:46,336 --> 00:37:48,237
"Love, Ralhp."

926
00:37:50,406 --> 00:37:53,408
TOBY: Look at 'em.
They're both content.

927
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:56,645
Love can be misspelled
and messy, but it still works.

928
00:37:56,647 --> 00:37:58,914
Just needs to be
given a chance.

929
00:38:05,688 --> 00:38:08,257
Oh, forget it.

930
00:38:22,906 --> 00:38:24,806
Whoa, what are you doing?

931
00:38:24,808 --> 00:38:26,408
Are you gonna punch me?

932
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:28,176
I don't think so.

933
00:38:28,178 --> 00:38:29,511
Okay, then.

934
00:38:29,513 --> 00:38:31,580
WOMAN:
What is going on?!

935
00:38:31,582 --> 00:38:33,148
This is extremely dangerous!

936
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,017
I have called the police.
Damn it.

937
00:38:35,019 --> 00:38:36,885
This cannot happen on school grounds!
Let's go, Ralph.

938
00:38:36,887 --> 00:38:38,086
What...?
She called the fuzz.

939
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:39,321
What about Sloan?

940
00:38:39,323 --> 00:38:40,923
Don't worry.
Chicks dig outlaws.

941
00:38:40,925 --> 00:38:42,724
Start the car!

942
00:38:42,726 --> 00:38:44,993
♪ ♪

943
00:38:48,598 --> 00:38:49,898
Hey.

944
00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:52,167
Uh, are we
still doing

945
00:38:52,169 --> 00:38:53,602
that business dinner
tomorrow night?

946
00:38:53,604 --> 00:38:55,404
(sighs)

947
00:38:55,406 --> 00:38:56,872
You know, um...

948
00:38:56,874 --> 00:38:59,575
I've been thinking
about that, now.

949
00:39:00,777 --> 00:39:03,879
You've been working hard
lately, and, uh...

950
00:39:03,881 --> 00:39:06,148
I don't want to take up
your Saturday.

951
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,650
If you think there's stuff
we should go over...

952
00:39:08,652 --> 00:39:10,185
You're an incredible asset
to the team,

953
00:39:10,187 --> 00:39:11,620
and I want what's best for you.

954
00:39:11,622 --> 00:39:13,355
That's a weekend off.

955
00:39:13,357 --> 00:39:16,191
Especially with a case
like today.

956
00:39:17,226 --> 00:39:18,860
Okay.

957
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,397
I'll see you Monday.

958
00:39:22,399 --> 00:39:23,865
Monday.

959
00:39:36,713 --> 00:39:39,281
Are you sending
a valentine to Megan?

960
00:39:41,884 --> 00:39:44,086
Why is that a secret?

961
00:39:44,088 --> 00:39:46,321
(whispering):
Because she's Walter's sister.

962
00:39:46,323 --> 00:39:47,823
I know that.

963
00:39:47,825 --> 00:39:49,825
So...

964
00:39:49,827 --> 00:39:51,259
he's my boss

965
00:39:51,261 --> 00:39:52,861
and my best friend.

966
00:39:52,863 --> 00:39:54,763
And she's sweet,
and you like her.

967
00:39:57,066 --> 00:39:58,533
(sighs)

968
00:39:58,535 --> 00:40:00,969
Chaz would send her
that valentine.

969
00:40:04,807 --> 00:40:06,274
Hey, soda?

970
00:40:06,276 --> 00:40:08,910
Figured we, uh,
order some pizza,

971
00:40:08,912 --> 00:40:10,345
pull an all-nighter
on this thing,

972
00:40:10,347 --> 00:40:11,880
you know, like the old days.

973
00:40:11,882 --> 00:40:14,850
You know,
normally I'd love to, but...

974
00:40:14,852 --> 00:40:17,285
I think I need to see
someone tonight.

975
00:40:17,287 --> 00:40:19,187
Oh, Valentine's.

976
00:40:19,189 --> 00:40:20,656
Ah.

977
00:40:20,658 --> 00:40:21,790
Who's the girl?

978
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:24,593
It's early stages.

979
00:40:24,595 --> 00:40:27,429
I didn't think you went
for the sappy holidays, buddy.

980
00:40:27,431 --> 00:40:29,498
(chuckles)
Yeah.

981
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,500
Whoever she is, she's, uh...

982
00:40:31,502 --> 00:40:33,335
she's lucky to have
a guy like you.

983
00:40:33,337 --> 00:40:35,070
You mean that?

984
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,872
Uh-huh. Of course.

985
00:40:36,874 --> 00:40:40,075
There's a reservation
at 8:00 at Escala,

986
00:40:40,077 --> 00:40:41,810
in my name, for tomorrow.

987
00:40:41,812 --> 00:40:43,245
You should take her.
