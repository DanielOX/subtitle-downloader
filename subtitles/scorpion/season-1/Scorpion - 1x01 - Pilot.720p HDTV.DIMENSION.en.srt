Yes, you said “I didn't

How about a certified Federal check 
for $50,000 in each of your pockets?

167
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:58,453
I ran checks on all of you.

168
00:07:58,455 --> 00:08:01,088
Mechanical prodigy, world-class shrink,

169
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,024
a human calculator.

170
00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:06,494
Brilliant minds working at half-capacity.

171
00:08:06,496 --> 00:08:08,563
You want to do something meaningful?

172
00:08:08,565 --> 00:08:09,864
Here's your chance.

173
00:08:09,866 --> 00:08:11,899
You don't, people and metal

174
00:08:11,901 --> 00:08:15,469
will be falling from the
sky in less than two hours.

175
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:17,672
It's your call.

176
00:08:21,903 --> 00:08:25,911
sync and corrections by <font color="#FF0000">dreaMaker7</font>
www.addic7ed.com

177
00:08:35,986 --> 00:08:39,669
Even with half my IQ, I wouldn't be
dumb enough to believe you twice.

178
00:08:39,776 --> 00:08:40,942
“Put it aside”?

179
00:08:40,944 --> 00:08:42,243
“Forget about it and move on”

180
00:08:42,245 --> 00:08:44,112
is not an option for people

181
00:08:44,114 --> 00:08:45,880
with photographic memories.

182
00:08:45,882 --> 00:08:47,348
Give us a minute.

183
00:08:55,558 --> 00:08:58,726
What the hell are you doing?

184
00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:02,964
I was mirroring you so your
subconscious can relate to me.

185
00:09:02,966 --> 00:09:05,099
I thought it would help you relax.

186
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:07,302
Do you think it's working?

187
00:09:09,171 --> 00:09:11,105
Breaking this down logically,
we're not just going to

188
00:09:11,107 --> 00:09:12,707
let those people fall out of the sky.

189
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:13,941
I'm telling you... I don't trust him.

190
00:09:13,943 --> 00:09:15,243
I get it.

191
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:17,545
But without an influx of capital, these two

192
00:09:17,547 --> 00:09:19,447
are just gonna go back to hacking banks.

193
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:21,249
And the next forensic analyst they run into

194
00:09:21,251 --> 00:09:23,484
won't be as nice as you.

195
00:09:23,486 --> 00:09:25,620
Now, personally, I'm cool,
I can handle myself.

196
00:09:25,622 --> 00:09:27,855
Time is wasting.

197
00:09:27,857 --> 00:09:30,525
We've got 56 planes to land.

198
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:41,111
WALTER: LAX Tower Control is the
main hub for all the other airports.

199
00:09:41,137 --> 00:09:42,503
Fix the software there, it autocorrects

200
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:43,971
in Long Beach and Burbank.
So, the new software's

201
00:09:43,973 --> 00:09:46,607
the glitch... first step is to 
delete that, then download

202
00:09:46,609 --> 00:09:48,309
the old software,
should be enough for the planes to land.

203
00:09:48,311 --> 00:09:49,944
So you're doing it?

204
00:09:49,946 --> 00:09:51,278
SYLVESTER: We go to LAX...

205
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,215
we fix the software, we are at a 90%

206
00:09:54,217 --> 00:09:56,417
- chance of success. 
- Grab your equipment.

207
00:09:56,419 --> 00:09:58,719
Mine, too, please?

208
00:09:58,721 --> 00:10:02,423
Must've been keeping tabs
on me to find me so quickly.

209
00:10:02,425 --> 00:10:05,292
I got promoted to the L.A. office.

210
00:10:05,294 --> 00:10:07,795
Only make sense that I would track you down.

211
00:10:07,797 --> 00:10:10,464
Your body language suggests
that's about half the truth.

212
00:10:13,301 --> 00:10:17,237
Of course, there's a 10%
chance that everyone dies.

213
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:19,139
You cross me on this,

214
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:21,041
I'll go online...

215
00:10:21,043 --> 00:10:22,810
and in less than a hour,

216
00:10:22,812 --> 00:10:25,245
I will erase you.

217
00:10:29,484 --> 00:10:30,884
(P.A. chiming)

218
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:33,375
CAPTAIN (over P.A.):
<i>Sorry for the delay, folks.</i>

219
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:36,402
We should have some more
information shortly.

220
00:10:36,404 --> 00:10:39,205
Thank you for your patience.

221
00:10:39,207 --> 00:10:41,941
Still no contact.

222
00:10:41,943 --> 00:10:43,459
- Your cell?
- Nothing.

223
00:10:43,557 --> 00:10:44,990
Back in the Air Force, I once dropped

224
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:46,858
down to 1,500 feet to catch a signal.

225
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,226
If we descend without comms,

226
00:10:48,228 --> 00:10:49,394
we could run into another plane.

227
00:10:49,396 --> 00:10:51,062
I'm sure there's an army of people

228
00:10:51,064 --> 00:10:52,597
working on this as we speak.

229
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:54,866
TOBY: <i>All right,</i>

230
00:10:54,868 --> 00:10:57,569
listen, when the FBI and the NSA fail,
do we get

231
00:10:57,571 --> 00:10:59,471
some kind of bonus here? I'd be willing

232
00:10:59,473 --> 00:11:01,206
to go double or nothing.
I'm just saying. Toby...

233
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,607
They were your top choice for this?

234
00:11:02,609 --> 00:11:04,209
Walter O'Brien is one of the five

235
00:11:04,211 --> 00:11:06,444
smartest people alive, so, yes.

236
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:08,647
DISPATCH: Be advised,
just got word from headquarters

237
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:10,482
there's a major pile-up on the 405.

238
00:11:10,484 --> 00:11:11,916
LAX is unreachable for hours.

239
00:11:11,918 --> 00:11:13,151
Repeat: LAX is a no-go.

240
00:11:13,153 --> 00:11:15,120
- Copy that.
- TOBY: Call for a helicopter.

241
00:11:15,122 --> 00:11:16,654
CABE: Air traffic's been shut down

242
00:11:16,656 --> 00:11:18,056
until the situation is resolved.

243
00:11:18,058 --> 00:11:19,357
No copter?

244
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:20,692
We're down to a 17% chance

245
00:11:20,694 --> 00:11:22,427
- of success.
- LLOYD: Pipe down, Rain Man.

246
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:23,829
Call him that again, you better hope

247
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,797
the Feds have a good dental plan.

248
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:28,032
- This is what we get with a car
full of geniuses? - What you'll get

249
00:11:28,034 --> 00:11:30,335
is a solution if everyone
keeps their mouth shut.

250
00:11:30,337 --> 00:11:32,136
Everyone, quiet!

251
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:34,506
We don't need to go to LAX.

252
00:11:34,508 --> 00:11:36,307
We just need a reliable wireless signal

253
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:37,642
with no chance of going down.

254
00:11:37,644 --> 00:11:40,278
I just fixed one a mile north of here.

255
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,313
(tires squealing)

256
00:11:42,315 --> 00:11:44,482
(sirens wailing)

257
00:11:46,585 --> 00:11:48,786
(door bell dings)

258
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:51,389
Owner!

259
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:54,092
Agent Gallo, Homeland Security.

260
00:11:54,094 --> 00:11:56,260
We need to commandeer your
diner for a national emergency.

261
00:11:56,262 --> 00:11:57,328
You can stay.

262
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,697
But that's it.

263
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:01,966
Everybody out!

264
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:03,601
Come on! Everybody out! Come on, come on!

265
00:12:03,603 --> 00:12:04,635
No, no, no, no, no.

266
00:12:04,637 --> 00:12:05,703
You-you pay tomorrow. Come on.

267
00:12:05,705 --> 00:12:07,371
Come on, out! Out! Out!

268
00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:09,173
GIANAKOS: Come on!

269
00:12:09,175 --> 00:12:10,308
What are you doing?

270
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,176
Any idea the bacteria on countertops?

271
00:12:12,178 --> 00:12:14,045
Just from chicken alone,
there are over 20 diseases

272
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:15,279
you can get from exposure.

273
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:17,448
This is wildly upsetting.

274
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:20,718
No, no, no, no, you stay.

275
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,420
Uh, Nemos, no customers, no tips,

276
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:23,621
And I cannot leave Ralph here with...

277
00:12:23,623 --> 00:12:25,633
Listen, my immigration status

278
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:28,325
makes me not so comfortable
around Federal agents.

279
00:12:28,327 --> 00:12:30,494
You lock up.

280
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,400
Ralph?

281
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:37,501
Good to see you again.

282
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,169
CABE: Roughly 89 minutes

283
00:12:39,171 --> 00:12:41,748
until the first plane goes down.

284
00:12:41,774 --> 00:12:43,974
Their lives are in our hands.

285
00:12:45,243 --> 00:12:48,221
PAIGE: Is there something wrong at LAX?

286
00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:50,414
It's top-secret.

287
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,850
How can it be top-secret

288
00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:55,019
if the guy who set up our
wireless is working on it?

289
00:12:55,021 --> 00:12:58,021
Happy, script a POST check
after the system's stabilized.

290
00:12:58,023 --> 00:13:00,491
Sylvester, run the odds on the patch

291
00:13:00,493 --> 00:13:01,792
linking back into the software.

292
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:04,161
We do not want the same problem tomorrow.

293
00:13:04,163 --> 00:13:05,229
Toby...

294
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:06,530
look for a saboteur.

295
00:13:06,532 --> 00:13:07,731
Walter, look for coffee.

296
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:09,833
This is gonna take me, like, 90 seconds.

297
00:13:09,835 --> 00:13:10,934
SYLVESTER: Screw this up, brains and guts

298
00:13:10,936 --> 00:13:12,302
are gonna bounce all over town.

299
00:13:12,304 --> 00:13:13,604
HAPPY: Actually, fuel tanks

300
00:13:13,606 --> 00:13:14,972
ignite on impact.

301
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:16,340
You won't find a body part.

302
00:13:16,342 --> 00:13:19,443
Eh, a blood-soaked spleen
could burn at a slower rate.

303
00:13:19,445 --> 00:13:20,777
Hey, please check

304
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:22,779
your language around my nine-year-old.

305
00:13:23,346 --> 00:13:25,048
Be decent in my place of work.

306
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,416
Thank you.

307
00:13:28,286 --> 00:13:29,653
(door opens)

308
00:13:29,655 --> 00:13:30,954
Secure channel to LAX.

309
00:13:30,956 --> 00:13:32,389
Air traffic supervisor is on the line.

310
00:13:32,391 --> 00:13:33,457
His name is Brooks.

311
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:34,791
Okay.

312
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:36,893
Mr. Brooks,
I'm hacking into airport security.

313
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,463
I'm gonna rotate your cameras
to point at the monitors.

314
00:13:39,465 --> 00:13:40,530
I'll see it remotely,

315
00:13:40,532 --> 00:13:42,566
and I'll walk you through each step.

316
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:43,834
Who am I on with here?

317
00:13:43,836 --> 00:13:45,535
I am not comfortable with you hacking

318
00:13:45,537 --> 00:13:47,704
- into anything at this airport.
- Then don't make it so easy.

319
00:13:47,706 --> 00:13:49,673
To answer your question,
my name is Walter O'Brien,

320
00:13:49,675 --> 00:13:52,008
and I was brought in to fix your
problem since you're not capable

321
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,009
of doing it yourself.

322
00:13:53,011 --> 00:13:53,944
Look behind you.

323
00:13:53,946 --> 00:13:55,211
Say hello to the camera, Mr. Brooks.

324
00:13:55,213 --> 00:13:57,280
I'm at your 10:00. Our goal is to reboot

325
00:13:57,282 --> 00:13:58,615
your computer and land those planes.

326
00:13:58,617 --> 00:13:59,716
To do that,

327
00:13:59,718 --> 00:14:01,184
hit control C right in between the flickers

328
00:14:01,186 --> 00:14:02,519
at the exact moment that I say now.

329
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:03,920
Ready?

330
00:14:03,922 --> 00:14:05,188
Now.

331
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,956
(beeps) (groans)

332
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,324
I missed. It's too fast.

333
00:14:08,326 --> 00:14:09,826
Moving on, you,

334
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:11,795
short sleeves and tie, you in the glasses,

335
00:14:11,797 --> 00:14:12,829
you code, right?

336
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:14,164
A little.

337
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,165
How'd you know?

338
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:16,266
Lucky guess. What's your name?

339
00:14:16,268 --> 00:14:18,935
Randy. Randy, take Mr. Brooks's seat.

340
00:14:18,937 --> 00:14:20,770
You guys are talking
about planes going down.

341
00:14:20,772 --> 00:14:21,938
I'm just an intern.

342
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,606
You just got promoted. Sit down!

343
00:14:23,608 --> 00:14:25,308
WALTER: Mr. Brooks, can you give Randy

344
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,210
the original installation disk to download?

345
00:14:27,212 --> 00:14:29,212
That software was installed 15 years ago.

346
00:14:29,214 --> 00:14:30,613
I have no idea where it is.

347
00:14:30,615 --> 00:14:31,714
The company went out of business.

348
00:14:31,716 --> 00:14:32,815
Where do you back up your data?

349
00:14:32,817 --> 00:14:34,884
- Blackstern Data Storage.
- Okay, we can get a copy

350
00:14:34,886 --> 00:14:36,586
of the old software from the backup server.

351
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:38,221
I e-mail it to Brooks, he clicks a link,

352
00:14:38,223 --> 00:14:39,756
and the system is up and running

353
00:14:39,758 --> 00:14:41,924
as if the corrupted software
was never downloaded.

354
00:14:41,926 --> 00:14:43,292
Blackstern's on Ventura.

355
00:14:43,294 --> 00:14:45,862
Northeast. Opposite
direction of the gridlock.

356
00:14:45,864 --> 00:14:48,064
You should know that the data is backed up

357
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:50,900
to the latest software
every 12 hours on the five.

358
00:14:50,902 --> 00:14:53,736
So in 20 minutes,
the last remaining useable software

359
00:14:53,738 --> 00:14:55,004
will be corrupted. Happy, Toby,

360
00:14:55,006 --> 00:14:57,740
get to the server and
get me that backup disk.

361
00:14:57,742 --> 00:14:59,375
Sylvester, call the data center;
tell them we're on our way.

362
00:14:59,377 --> 00:15:01,177
I'm gonna prep here to relay to LAX.

363
00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:02,611
Bates, take 'em.

364
00:15:02,613 --> 00:15:03,946
Stay in contact.

365
00:15:03,948 --> 00:15:06,582
Walter, you tell that waitress
I'm gonna be right back.

366
00:15:06,584 --> 00:15:08,184
Toby, in situations like this,

367
00:15:08,186 --> 00:15:10,319
carelessness, mistakes, they will haunt you.

368
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:12,488
I know this from experience.

369
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,756
Walter, I'm always on point.

370
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:16,091
Have you seen my hat?

371
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:20,696
Here, I thought you might be thirsty.

372
00:15:20,698 --> 00:15:21,697
Thank you.

373
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:22,698
Mm-hmm.

374
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,200
You have anemia.

375
00:15:24,202 --> 00:15:26,969
It turns your fingernails pitted.

376
00:15:26,971 --> 00:15:28,404
That's why your polish looks streaky.

377
00:15:28,406 --> 00:15:29,538
You need more iron.

378
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,340
(chuckles) Okay.

379
00:15:31,342 --> 00:15:33,242
I don't recall asking, Einstein.

380
00:15:33,244 --> 00:15:35,577
Einstein had a 160 IQ.

381
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:37,179
- Mine's 197. 
- Wow.

382
00:15:37,181 --> 00:15:40,049
So you must know everything about me,
if you're that smart.

383
00:15:42,385 --> 00:15:44,987
You have no-name sneakers, he has orthotics.

384
00:15:44,989 --> 00:15:46,121
Whatever you have goes to Ralph.

385
00:15:46,123 --> 00:15:48,090
The inflammation under your eyes

386
00:15:48,092 --> 00:15:49,658
from lack of sunlight comes

387
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,126
from working two jobs...

388
00:15:51,128 --> 00:15:52,761
As for the boy's father, I'd make

389
00:15:52,763 --> 00:15:54,429
calculated assumptions

390
00:15:54,431 --> 00:15:57,299
in the realm of interpersonal
communication issues.

391
00:15:57,301 --> 00:16:00,969
Oh, so we split because I
have issues communicating.

392
00:16:00,971 --> 00:16:02,271
And I thought it was

393
00:16:02,273 --> 00:16:03,472
the blonde in Tahoe.

394
00:16:03,474 --> 00:16:06,618
Who the hell are you to tell me
that my polish looks cheap?

395
00:16:06,644 --> 00:16:09,444
That-that hurts my feelings.

396
00:16:09,446 --> 00:16:11,480
Do you understand?

397
00:16:11,482 --> 00:16:13,081
Yeah.

398
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,416
I recognize that.

399
00:16:14,418 --> 00:16:16,485
I've been told things
like that a lot before.

400
00:16:16,487 --> 00:16:17,919
And my polish streaks because Ralph does it.

401
00:16:17,921 --> 00:16:19,721
He loves to paint, and don't tell me

402
00:16:19,723 --> 00:16:21,456
that he needs help, either. He's challenged.

403
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,625
Have some empathy.

404
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,767
(sighs)

405
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:35,003
Challenged, huh?

406
00:16:35,005 --> 00:16:36,805
Look at Sylvester and him.

407
00:16:36,807 --> 00:16:38,740
Do you know what they're doing?

408
00:16:38,742 --> 00:16:41,443
The matches are the king,
the jelly is the queen,

409
00:16:41,445 --> 00:16:43,311
the sugar packets are the knights.

410
00:16:43,313 --> 00:16:45,380
He's playing chess with a grand master

411
00:16:45,382 --> 00:16:46,881
who's about to lose.

412
00:16:46,883 --> 00:16:48,516
Walter, you see this?

413
00:16:48,518 --> 00:16:50,919
Check mate in eight moves.

414
00:16:50,921 --> 00:16:52,387
This kid is amazing!

415
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:54,856
And he doesn't like to paint your nails.

416
00:16:54,858 --> 00:16:57,125
He does it because he wants

417
00:16:57,127 --> 00:16:58,960
to hold your hand, but he can't process

418
00:16:58,962 --> 00:17:00,728
physical contact.

419
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,698
So help him.

420
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,167
Or he will never connect with you.

421
00:17:07,336 --> 00:17:09,437
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news,

422
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,773
but your son is a genius.

423
00:17:21,301 --> 00:17:23,202
HAPPY: <i>Walter, we're 
approaching</i> <i>the data center.</i>

424
00:17:23,204 --> 00:17:24,871
<i>We should have the backup hard drive soon.</i>

425
00:17:24,873 --> 00:17:26,505
WALTER: <i>Copy that, Happy.</i>

426
00:17:26,507 --> 00:17:27,873
<i>Standing by.</i>

427
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:31,611
(sirens wailing, tires squealing)

428
00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:35,848
No, it's supposed to be open 24/7!

429
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,383
Looks like they cut out.

430
00:17:37,385 --> 00:17:38,551
HAPPY: Walt?

431
00:17:38,553 --> 00:17:41,020
We got a problem. No one's home.

432
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:43,289
You're the mechanical engineer!
Pick the lock!

433
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,990
I have my tools, but it'll take a lot longer

434
00:17:45,016 --> 00:17:47,142
than the six minutes we have
before the bad software backs up

435
00:17:47,168 --> 00:17:48,880
- onto the servers.
- Bates, get them in.

436
00:17:48,906 --> 00:17:50,639
Step aside.

437
00:17:50,665 --> 00:17:52,331
- Whoa! 
- Are you insane?

438
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,067
You're the one putting hands on a Fed.

439
00:17:55,069 --> 00:17:57,570
That is 75-millimeter,
six-layer polycarbonate casing.

440
00:17:57,572 --> 00:18:00,973
It won't break,
but a round could deflect and kill somebody.

441
00:18:00,975 --> 00:18:02,174
Walt,

442
00:18:02,176 --> 00:18:03,509
please don't let the Fed talk anymore.

443
00:18:03,511 --> 00:18:04,810
SYLVESTER: We're down

444
00:18:04,812 --> 00:18:06,679
to a four-percent chance of success.

445
00:18:06,681 --> 00:18:09,491
CABE: Five minutes from now, the 
software we need disappears forever.

446
00:18:09,517 --> 00:18:10,849
If that happens,

447
00:18:10,851 --> 00:18:12,551
20,000 people die.

448
00:18:12,553 --> 00:18:15,387
Hey, Ralph, let's go in the office, okay?

449
00:18:16,456 --> 00:18:18,090
WALTER: <i>We got to abandon the data center.</i>

450
00:18:18,092 --> 00:18:19,558
We got to pull the team back,

451
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,926
get four minds working together at once,

452
00:18:20,928 --> 00:18:22,561
and then, maybe within an hour,
we'll be able...

453
00:18:22,563 --> 00:18:24,062
By then, the first two 
planes will be out of fuel.

454
00:18:24,064 --> 00:18:25,898
Do you really think you can come up

455
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,166
- with an option by then?
- Hold on.

456
00:18:27,168 --> 00:18:28,934
You're just accepting two planes going down.

457
00:18:28,936 --> 00:18:30,469
We lose two planes to save 54.

458
00:18:30,471 --> 00:18:33,472
That's a trade we're gonna have to make.

459
00:18:33,474 --> 00:18:35,407
Contact the FAA and tell them
these two flights are terminal.

460
00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:38,043
Agent Gallo is implementing
the greater good theory.

461
00:18:38,045 --> 00:18:40,312
Loss is acceptable as
long as the resulting gain

462
00:18:40,314 --> 00:18:41,346
is large enough.

463
00:18:41,348 --> 00:18:43,048
No, it isn't. You save everybody.

464
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,250
Normal people save everybody.

465
00:18:45,252 --> 00:18:47,452
- I'm not normal.
- I don't care!

466
00:18:47,454 --> 00:18:49,955
Use that 197 IQ of yours.

467
00:18:49,957 --> 00:18:52,691
Take a deep breath and reset.

468
00:18:58,531 --> 00:18:59,731
Reset.

469
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:00,866
Reset, reset.

470
00:19:00,868 --> 00:19:01,967
Happy, we need to reset

471
00:19:01,969 --> 00:19:03,101
the door lock.

472
00:19:03,103 --> 00:19:04,102
We need to brown-out

473
00:19:04,104 --> 00:19:05,837
ten blocks around the data center.

474
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:08,139
- Kill the electricity to part of Los Angeles?
- Mm-hmm.

475
00:19:08,141 --> 00:19:09,307
Just turn it off in that one building!

476
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:11,076
We can't focus a surge that precisely,

477
00:19:11,078 --> 00:19:12,544
but a brief power surge

478
00:19:12,546 --> 00:19:14,979
will open up the door,
and we'll be able to get in.

479
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:17,182
You're gonna owe me a new slim pick.

480
00:19:17,184 --> 00:19:18,783
All right, we need to find 
a municipal junction box

481
00:19:18,785 --> 00:19:19,951
that covers that area.

482
00:19:19,953 --> 00:19:21,319
It should be on a commercial street.

483
00:19:21,321 --> 00:19:23,641
- I'll check the south. 
- North.

484
00:19:25,391 --> 00:19:26,391
Got one!

485
00:19:26,393 --> 00:19:27,892
All right,
calculate the kilowatts it'll take

486
00:19:27,894 --> 00:19:29,928
it'll take to overpower a surge
within a ten-block radius.

487
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,396
No, no, no, no, no.

488
00:19:31,398 --> 00:19:32,463
Ooh. Not now, Sylvester.

489
00:19:32,465 --> 00:19:33,865
CABE: Wait, wait, what are you doing?

490
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:36,935
I can't calculate without order;
it's my process.

491
00:19:36,937 --> 00:19:38,870
My process involves my foot in your ass.

492
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:40,538
Hold on. Here.

493
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,940
One piece.

494
00:19:41,942 --> 00:19:43,574
It's the biggest and the smallest,
so it's in order.

495
00:19:43,576 --> 00:19:46,010
That works.

496
00:19:47,313 --> 00:19:50,415
(horn blowing)

497
00:19:52,684 --> 00:19:54,685
Uh, Sylvester, I don't want
to hurry your process...

498
00:19:54,687 --> 00:19:56,020
500,000 kilowatts!

499
00:19:56,022 --> 00:19:57,088
All right!

500
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,056
We need exactly 500,000 kilowatts.

501
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:00,158
Can you handle that?

502
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,259
Come on.

503
00:20:01,261 --> 00:20:02,927
Who rigged our whole office this morning?

504
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:04,395
I'm on it.

505
00:20:04,397 --> 00:20:05,963
Okay, ready?

506
00:20:05,965 --> 00:20:07,431
Here we go.

507
00:20:07,433 --> 00:20:09,700
(electricity crackling, power whirring down)

508
00:20:15,607 --> 00:20:17,174
We're in. We're in!

509
00:20:17,176 --> 00:20:19,176
There!

510
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:24,782
Not good.

511
00:20:24,784 --> 00:20:26,951
We have less than a minute. Which one is it?

512
00:20:26,953 --> 00:20:28,786
Okay, these servers run the facilities.

513
00:20:28,788 --> 00:20:30,788
So the clients would be in the cage.

514
00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:39,363
Yeah, this guy, he's the boss.

515
00:20:39,365 --> 00:20:41,465
Cuff links, tie clip, anal micro-manager.

516
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:43,567
Makes all the calls as to
what gets stored where.

517
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:45,002
Look at his belt tail; he's a lefty.

518
00:20:45,004 --> 00:20:46,136
So we eliminate the right-side servers.

519
00:20:46,138 --> 00:20:47,304
He'd subconsciously put

520
00:20:47,306 --> 00:20:49,173
a big client like LAX on
his dominant hand side.

521
00:20:49,175 --> 00:20:50,641
There's still about 250 servers.

522
00:20:50,643 --> 00:20:52,943
Okay, you think LAX, you think planes.

523
00:20:52,945 --> 00:20:54,945
You think planes,
you think high, so eliminate

524
00:20:54,947 --> 00:20:56,046
the bottom three shelves.

525
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:57,214
100 servers left. Ten seconds.

526
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:59,283
- Get on it! 
- He's what, five-six, tops?

527
00:20:59,285 --> 00:21:00,451
So it won't be the top shelf.

528
00:21:00,453 --> 00:21:02,019
Napoleonic boss man would
never use a step ladder

529
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:03,253
in front of his employees.

530
00:21:03,255 --> 00:21:04,488
So it's one of these....

531
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,556
This one!

532
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:06,657
Ah! Time's up.

533
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:08,058
(servers whirring)

534
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,993
How did you know for sure?

535
00:21:09,995 --> 00:21:11,962
'Cause it says “LAX” right here.

536
00:21:11,964 --> 00:21:14,097
Oh...

537
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:15,566
You are impressed.

538
00:21:26,711 --> 00:21:29,413
He doesn't even know we're here.

539
00:21:29,415 --> 00:21:31,348
He's wondering if those flashlights

540
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,251
can be powered by the heat
of the hand that holds them.

541
00:21:34,253 --> 00:21:37,354
Or he's calculating the cubic footage

542
00:21:37,356 --> 00:21:38,789
of the octagon clock.

543
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,056
He thinks about anything.

544
00:21:40,058 --> 00:21:41,458
Everything.

545
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,894
Did you let him beat you, earlier?

546
00:21:43,896 --> 00:21:46,062
No.

547
00:21:46,064 --> 00:21:48,498
I-I had no idea he even liked chess.

548
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,333
SYLVESTER: Few parents meaningfully engage

549
00:21:50,335 --> 00:21:51,601
with mentally enabled children.

550
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:53,770
It's not your fault.

551
00:21:55,873 --> 00:21:59,142
It's just... how we are.

552
00:22:01,376 --> 00:22:04,380
How did your parents handle it?

553
00:22:04,382 --> 00:22:07,250
Oh, I-I haven't spoken to them in ten years.

554
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,955
(rapid beeping)

555
00:22:13,421 --> 00:22:16,135
NSA satellite link failed.

556
00:22:16,161 --> 00:22:17,861
Where the hell are your people?

557
00:22:17,863 --> 00:22:20,797
That kid Toby doesn't exactly
fill me with confidence.

558
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,233
Toby grew up penniless,

559
00:22:23,235 --> 00:22:24,534
gambled his way through school.

560
00:22:24,536 --> 00:22:27,580
Even then, he got his doctorate
at the age of 17.

561
00:22:27,606 --> 00:22:30,073
Sometimes people like us need...

562
00:22:30,075 --> 00:22:32,675
repair... before we can fit into your world.

563
00:22:32,677 --> 00:22:34,677
I know the aftermath was devastating.

564
00:22:35,342 --> 00:22:37,380
I did keep tabs on you.

565
00:22:37,382 --> 00:22:40,450
TOBY: Seat backs and tray tables up!

566
00:22:40,452 --> 00:22:42,985
Those planes are as good as landed.

567
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,253
Endlessly patting himself on the back,

568
00:22:44,255 --> 00:22:45,288
the whole ride here.

569
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,490
I just want a statue of me at LAX.

570
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:48,524
Now what?

571
00:22:48,526 --> 00:22:49,659
Easy as sending a file.

572
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:51,227
Mr. Brooks, in a moment,

573
00:22:51,229 --> 00:22:52,528
you'll receive a bug-free version

574
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,596
of the software.

575
00:22:53,598 --> 00:22:57,322
All you have to do is open 
your e-mail and click a link.

576
00:22:58,936 --> 00:23:00,336
(rapid beeping) Wait.

577
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:01,804
The hard drive's frozen.

578
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:02,972
The files are corrupted.

579
00:23:02,974 --> 00:23:04,006
They're useless.

580
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,908
We took it out as carefully as we could.

581
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,176
WALTER: How'd you transport it?

582
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:08,544
It was wrapped in a towel,

583
00:23:08,546 --> 00:23:10,446
tucked in a door console
so I wouldn't drop it.

584
00:23:11,548 --> 00:23:13,983
Was there an audio speaker in the door?

585
00:23:13,985 --> 00:23:15,384
TOBY: Yeah. So?

586
00:23:15,386 --> 00:23:18,053
What? The magnet erased the hard drive.

587
00:23:18,055 --> 00:23:19,488
- It's useless now. 
- No, no, no, no.

588
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:20,956
It's not my fault.

589
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:22,258
I didn't know anything about
magnets in car speakers.

590
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,220
You've stolen hundreds of them, Toby.

591
00:23:25,662 --> 00:23:26,662
Oh...

592
00:23:26,664 --> 00:23:27,763
No place on Earth has what we need.

593
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:29,698
CABE: FBI just texted.

594
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,201
They're out, too.

595
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,703
We're at less than one percent,

596
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:35,985
Walter...

597
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:51,487
You know what I'm going to tell you.

598
00:23:51,489 --> 00:23:52,454
There was a fourth team.

599
00:23:52,456 --> 00:23:55,090
Tracking the planes via radar.

600
00:23:55,092 --> 00:23:57,826
Circling over the ocean...

601
00:23:57,828 --> 00:23:58,994
fighter jets...

602
00:23:58,996 --> 00:23:59,962
You'll shoot them down?

603
00:23:59,964 --> 00:24:01,096
Same protocol was activated

604
00:24:01,098 --> 00:24:04,533
on 9/11 to prevent
possible ground casualties.

605
00:24:04,535 --> 00:24:07,336
Can you think of anything we can do?

606
00:24:10,673 --> 00:24:12,574
(speed dial blipping)

607
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,242
Contact Director Merrick.

608
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:17,412
Tell him we need to
activate the fourth option.

609
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,214
PAIGE: Hey...

610
00:24:19,216 --> 00:24:20,449
Walter.

611
00:24:20,451 --> 00:24:21,683
I know what's going on.

612
00:24:21,685 --> 00:24:24,519
Actually, uh, there's only
100 people in the world

613
00:24:24,521 --> 00:24:25,754
who really know anything

614
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,255
and unfortunately, you're not one of them.

615
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,523
You're doing what Ralph does

616
00:24:28,525 --> 00:24:30,091
when he doesn't understand
how to fix a problem.

617
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,860
He panics and shuts down.

618
00:24:31,862 --> 00:24:32,928
When you don't know something,

619
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:33,962
you feel like you don't know anything.

620
00:24:33,964 --> 00:24:35,163
For all practical purposes,

621
00:24:35,165 --> 00:24:36,298
I have no right brain.

622
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,366
People with high IQ tend to have low EQ.

623
00:24:38,368 --> 00:24:39,334
That's emotional quotient.

624
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:41,102
So these big speeches, pep talks...

625
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,270
they don't work on me.

626
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,371
They work on athletes,
they work on children,

627
00:24:43,373 --> 00:24:44,339
they work on waitresses.

628
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:45,473
They don't work on people like me.

629
00:24:45,475 --> 00:24:46,808
Oh, oh, I get it, I'm the dumb waitress.

630
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,143
- I never called you that.
-  But I'm smart enough

631
00:24:48,145 --> 00:24:49,277
to know that you're scared.

632
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,779
You don't know how to solve the problem

633
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:52,313
and you're terrified
because people will die.

634
00:24:52,315 --> 00:24:53,615
Well, they won't die because of me.

635
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,883
And they won't live because of you, either,

636
00:24:54,885 --> 00:24:56,584
because you're just giving
up and walking away.

637
00:24:56,586 --> 00:24:58,920
Don't lecture me about how
people dying will make me feel.

638
00:24:58,922 --> 00:25:00,221
I already know!

639
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,827
What does that mean?

640
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,698
Walter...

641
00:25:12,401 --> 00:25:14,335
what does that mean?

642
00:25:24,012 --> 00:25:24,912
Hey, sweetheart.

643
00:25:24,914 --> 00:25:27,482
Let's go back inside, okay?

644
00:25:33,316 --> 00:25:35,455
Yes, sir, I understand.

645
00:25:35,481 --> 00:25:38,080
I'll draft an alert for the
Emergency Broadcast System ASAP.

646
00:25:38,106 --> 00:25:39,639
Don't hang up.

647
00:25:40,396 --> 00:25:42,063
Tell them there's still a chance.

648
00:25:42,065 --> 00:25:43,965
Put a pin in that, sir.
We may have something here.

649
00:25:43,967 --> 00:25:45,433
Software's on the planes.

650
00:25:45,435 --> 00:25:47,969
They use a duplicate copy to
communicate with the tower.

651
00:25:47,971 --> 00:25:49,637
Now, if they took off before
this morning's update,

652
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:50,638
like a flight from

653
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,173
Australia or New Zealand,

654
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,941
they'll still have the
bug-free software on board.

655
00:25:53,943 --> 00:25:54,975
CABE: Okay.

656
00:25:54,977 --> 00:25:57,244
But we still have the same problem.

657
00:25:57,246 --> 00:25:59,113
What we need is seven miles over our head

658
00:25:59,115 --> 00:26:00,281
and there's no way to get in touch

659
00:26:00,283 --> 00:26:01,649
with the people who have it.

660
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,991
Yes, there is.

661
00:26:17,428 --> 00:26:19,824
WALTER:<i> Klemmer Airfield</i> <i>is 20 minutes away.</i>

662
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,684
<i>Get me there in ten,
and I can</i> <i>download that software.</i>

663
00:26:21,686 --> 00:26:23,218
If you're gonna shut down all the roads

664
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,320
that lead to Klemmer Airfield,

665
00:26:24,322 --> 00:26:25,521
there's gonna be lots of moving parts.

666
00:26:25,523 --> 00:26:27,122
I still think it's the wrong play;

667
00:26:27,124 --> 00:26:28,223
the runways are too short there.

668
00:26:28,225 --> 00:26:29,725
It's just a low fly-by.

669
00:26:29,727 --> 00:26:31,060
There's a neighborhood next door.

670
00:26:31,062 --> 00:26:32,828
If something goes wrong,
you take out half a block.

671
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,096
It's actually four blocks,
but I won't let that happen.

672
00:26:34,098 --> 00:26:35,264
I don't know if that's going to be enough

673
00:26:35,266 --> 00:26:37,066
to get LAPD to set up rolling road blocks.

674
00:26:37,068 --> 00:26:39,568
We're talking about major
roads in a major city.

675
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,303
There's safety risks, there's procedure...

676
00:26:41,305 --> 00:26:43,272
I know what you're doing.

677
00:26:43,274 --> 00:26:45,207
You're covering yourself
in case of casualties.

678
00:26:45,209 --> 00:26:47,109
I don't put protocol over lives.

679
00:26:47,111 --> 00:26:48,143
Lives?

680
00:26:48,145 --> 00:26:49,845
Suddenly you're worried about lives?

681
00:26:49,847 --> 00:26:50,913
We can debate the past later.

682
00:26:50,915 --> 00:26:52,247
Right now, if you want my help,

683
00:26:52,249 --> 00:26:53,448
then let me make the calls

684
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,183
and see if I can't get this done for you.

685
00:26:55,185 --> 00:26:56,585
Let's go.

686
00:26:59,922 --> 00:27:01,223
I know he thinks he's helping,

687
00:27:01,225 --> 00:27:02,624
but we don't have time for

688
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:03,658
bureaucracy right now.

689
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,227
Happy, if I hack you into the DOT,

690
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:06,762
can you manipulate the traffic signals?

691
00:27:06,764 --> 00:27:07,896
They're on standard sequencers;

692
00:27:07,898 --> 00:27:09,197
- don't see why not. 
- So you shut down

693
00:27:09,199 --> 00:27:10,732
the roads, we drive fast as hell,

694
00:27:10,734 --> 00:27:12,000
we might be able to pull this off. Toby,

695
00:27:12,002 --> 00:27:13,568
I need you to check the manifest...

696
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,903
For a passenger up there

697
00:27:14,905 --> 00:27:16,037
whose phone is still on.

698
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:17,572
Walt, I got this.

699
00:27:17,574 --> 00:27:19,207
- Don't worry. 
- All right.

700
00:27:19,209 --> 00:27:21,176
I'm gonna need to upgrade
my wireless antenna software

701
00:27:21,178 --> 00:27:22,510
to pick up the signal from the plane,

702
00:27:22,512 --> 00:27:25,413
so someone's gonna have to drive me there.

703
00:27:25,415 --> 00:27:27,182
Um... I don't have my license,

704
00:27:27,184 --> 00:27:28,650
but...

705
00:27:28,652 --> 00:27:29,985
I'm more of a bus guy...

706
00:27:29,987 --> 00:27:31,486
I-I understand the basic mechanics

707
00:27:31,488 --> 00:27:33,221
- of-of how this works... 
- Sylvester.

708
00:27:33,223 --> 00:27:35,890
I really need you here, helping Toby.

709
00:27:37,793 --> 00:27:38,993
But thank you, pal.

710
00:27:57,046 --> 00:27:59,180
Uh, driving through L.A.

711
00:27:59,182 --> 00:28:00,382
with nothing but green lights...

712
00:28:00,383 --> 00:28:02,250
it's kind of always been a fantasy of mine.

713
00:28:02,252 --> 00:28:03,618
At high speed? No.

714
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,485
Somebody's gotta drive.

715
00:28:04,487 --> 00:28:06,154
Come on.

716
00:28:06,156 --> 00:28:08,790
Your son needs you.

717
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:10,625
I've tried really hard,

718
00:28:10,627 --> 00:28:12,193
but I've never been able
to fully connect with him,

719
00:28:12,195 --> 00:28:14,896
not in the way that I've seen
him connect with you guys today.

720
00:28:15,898 --> 00:28:17,532
What my son needs

721
00:28:17,534 --> 00:28:19,867
is to see me help you.

722
00:28:21,436 --> 00:28:24,038
Please, Walter.

723
00:28:25,307 --> 00:28:26,507
You're a good mom.

724
00:28:28,944 --> 00:28:31,279
Or a very bad one.

725
00:28:31,281 --> 00:28:32,680
No, we need roads blocked the entire time.

726
00:28:32,682 --> 00:28:34,181
Why do I need to call the highway patrol?

727
00:28:34,183 --> 00:28:35,449
We're only staying on side streets!

728
00:28:35,451 --> 00:28:36,617
(tires squealing)

729
00:28:39,221 --> 00:28:41,255
What the...?

730
00:28:41,257 --> 00:28:42,957
HAPPY: <i>Okay, Walter,</i>

731
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:44,392
<i>I'm tracking you on the traffic cams.</i>

732
00:28:44,394 --> 00:28:47,628
They should start changing... now.

733
00:28:49,331 --> 00:28:50,631
It's working!

734
00:28:53,902 --> 00:28:54,802
Hold on!

735
00:28:55,871 --> 00:28:57,037
(horn honking)

736
00:29:00,942 --> 00:29:03,244
We're at 100.
This thing doesn't have air bags.

737
00:29:03,246 --> 00:29:05,145
Well, you know, at these speeds,
they're useless.

738
00:29:05,147 --> 00:29:06,714
Go faster.

739
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,884
There's 440 people on the flight.

740
00:29:10,886 --> 00:29:12,720
They all have their phones off
'cause they're on a damn plane.

741
00:29:12,722 --> 00:29:14,521
How the hell am I supposed
to communicate with them?

742
00:29:14,523 --> 00:29:16,056
I'm checking Sigalert; you should head south

743
00:29:16,058 --> 00:29:17,591
on Hilgard to Manning,

744
00:29:17,593 --> 00:29:18,826
then Santa Monica to Bundy.

745
00:29:18,828 --> 00:29:20,227
I'll get you a clear path.

746
00:29:26,301 --> 00:29:27,734
I think that's Agent Gallo!

747
00:29:27,736 --> 00:29:29,369
Keep driving.

748
00:29:29,371 --> 00:29:30,604
Guys, stay frosty.

749
00:29:30,606 --> 00:29:32,673
I can't get the light on
Barrington to change over.

750
00:29:34,342 --> 00:29:35,542
No, no, Walter...

751
00:29:35,544 --> 00:29:38,178
No, no, no, no, no! No!

752
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:44,671
Oh... Oh, God.

753
00:29:50,691 --> 00:29:52,292
What the hell was that?

754
00:29:52,294 --> 00:29:55,529
Greater good theory in practice.

755
00:29:55,531 --> 00:29:56,797
Now just get to that airfield

756
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,165
and don't make me regret this!

757
00:29:58,167 --> 00:30:00,734
WALTER: <i>We're almost there.</i>

758
00:30:00,736 --> 00:30:01,868
Toby, did you find a passenger

759
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,770
on one of those planes with an active phone?

760
00:30:03,772 --> 00:30:06,606
Sylvester, I need more passenger names.

761
00:30:06,608 --> 00:30:07,807
Novell software technology's too old

762
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:09,676
to do any this in five minutes.

763
00:30:09,678 --> 00:30:11,511
And even if someone's phone was on,

764
00:30:11,513 --> 00:30:13,213
how do we get in touch
with them at 36,000 feet?

765
00:30:13,215 --> 00:30:14,247
Old technology!

766
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:15,382
That's it! We-we-we find someone

767
00:30:15,384 --> 00:30:17,183
with an out-of-date analog phone.

768
00:30:17,185 --> 00:30:18,785
The receivers are 10 times
stronger than smartphones.

769
00:30:18,787 --> 00:30:20,453
They can get a signal up there.

770
00:30:20,455 --> 00:30:22,455
All right, we lose anyone under 50.

771
00:30:22,457 --> 00:30:23,556
Can't make over six figures.

772
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:25,825
Can't work for a tech company...

773
00:30:25,827 --> 00:30:26,860
Salesmen!

774
00:30:26,862 --> 00:30:28,728
Salesmen never turn off their phones.

775
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:30,029
They risk losing business.

776
00:30:30,031 --> 00:30:31,264
And... duh duh duh duh duh duh...

777
00:30:31,266 --> 00:30:32,532
Gordon Tooley!

778
00:30:32,534 --> 00:30:34,601
Plastics salesman from Reseda

779
00:30:34,603 --> 00:30:36,269
returning from a work trip.

780
00:30:36,271 --> 00:30:38,671
Service is linked to a Retron A-64 analog.

781
00:30:38,673 --> 00:30:39,706
Call him!

782
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:41,874
(phone ringing)

783
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,483
Hello?

784
00:30:50,485 --> 00:30:52,051
Mr. Tooley, listen carefully.

785
00:30:52,053 --> 00:30:53,453
This is Homeland Security.

786
00:30:53,455 --> 00:30:54,487
There's an emergency on your flight.

787
00:30:54,489 --> 00:30:55,521
We need your help.

788
00:30:55,523 --> 00:30:56,889
Nice try, Sully.

789
00:30:56,891 --> 00:30:58,491
I'll see you at work, ya putz.

790
00:30:58,493 --> 00:30:59,659
Yeah, this isn't Sully,

791
00:30:59,661 --> 00:31:01,127
'cause Sully wouldn't know that right now,

792
00:31:01,129 --> 00:31:02,829
outside of your window are
the Santa Monica Mountains.

793
00:31:02,831 --> 00:31:03,663
And right above them

794
00:31:03,665 --> 00:31:05,131
<i>are two F-22s,</i>

795
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:07,033
<i>ready to shoot you out of the sky.</i>

796
00:31:07,035 --> 00:31:08,601
So I need you to get off your ass,

797
00:31:08,603 --> 00:31:09,702
grab a flight attendant

798
00:31:09,704 --> 00:31:11,404
and tell them to get
your phone to the pilot.

799
00:31:11,406 --> 00:31:12,672
(engine roaring, tires squealing)

800
00:31:12,674 --> 00:31:14,907
CAPTAIN: This is Captain Pike, standing by.

801
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:16,809
Captain Pike, you're carrying 
an uncorrupted version

802
00:31:16,811 --> 00:31:19,245
of control tower software.

803
00:31:19,247 --> 00:31:21,614
Now, you need to e-mail it to me
so it can be downloaded at LAX.

804
00:31:21,616 --> 00:31:22,948
Copy.

805
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,685
But our onboard wireless
only has a limited reach.

806
00:31:25,687 --> 00:31:27,687
What do you want me to do?

807
00:31:27,689 --> 00:31:29,088
Buzz the tower at 100 feet.

808
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,756
I should be able to grab your wireless.

809
00:31:30,758 --> 00:31:32,358
Where will you be? We just arrived

810
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,392
at Klemmer Airfield; we called ahead.

811
00:31:33,394 --> 00:31:34,427
Runway two has been cleared.

812
00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:35,428
I'm right over Klemmer.

813
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,163
Could be there in less than a minute.

814
00:31:37,165 --> 00:31:38,397
Time to advise the passengers.

815
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,199
Ladies and gentlemen,
please remain in your seats

816
00:31:40,201 --> 00:31:41,333
with your seat belt fastened.

817
00:31:41,335 --> 00:31:42,434
- Mr. O'Brien? 
- Yes.

818
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:43,702
I've got a space cleared for you up here.

819
00:31:43,704 --> 00:31:45,337
Thank you. Okay.

820
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:46,572
I've linked my computer up to LAX,

821
00:31:46,574 --> 00:31:48,173
so as soon as I get the download,

822
00:31:48,175 --> 00:31:49,775
they'll have it as well.

823
00:31:49,777 --> 00:31:51,644
Here it comes.

824
00:31:51,646 --> 00:31:52,845
WALTER: Captain Pike, maintain at 100 feet.

825
00:31:52,847 --> 00:31:54,813
I should be able to catch your Wi-Fi signal

826
00:31:54,815 --> 00:31:56,215
and download your software.

827
00:32:00,253 --> 00:32:02,021
This is Captain Pike.

828
00:32:02,023 --> 00:32:03,555
Do I have confirmation? Over.

829
00:32:03,557 --> 00:32:06,658
Were you able to download that software?

830
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,294
No, there's too much of a speed differential

831
00:32:09,296 --> 00:32:10,295
between a plane

832
00:32:10,297 --> 00:32:11,630
and a stationary laptop. Over.

833
00:32:11,632 --> 00:32:13,232
- Let's try again. 
- Doing the same thing

834
00:32:13,234 --> 00:32:15,834
but expecting a different result
is the definition of insanity.

835
00:32:15,836 --> 00:32:17,169
It won't work.

836
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:20,639
Mr. O'Brien, I've got 240 souls onboard.

837
00:32:20,641 --> 00:32:23,342
Please tell me there's
something else you can do.

838
00:32:23,344 --> 00:32:26,345
I just solved the speed
differential problem.

839
00:32:28,815 --> 00:32:32,951
Happy, I need you to
get me into a Ferrari 458.

840
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:35,520
Force the gas cap open.

841
00:32:35,522 --> 00:32:37,089
There's an engine cover emergency release.

842
00:32:37,091 --> 00:32:38,790
- All right. 
- Left hand side of the engine bay.

843
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:40,392
Pull out the ECM chip.

844
00:32:40,394 --> 00:32:42,828
(engine revving) Can you get that
plane about eight feet off the ground?

845
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,397
- Eight feet? What for? 
- Can't risk missing

846
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:47,299
the wireless signal again,
so we're gonna have to hardwire it

847
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:49,601
- into the computer.
- You're the world's smartest computer guy,

848
00:32:49,603 --> 00:32:51,002
and this comes down to
plugging something in?

849
00:32:51,004 --> 00:32:52,437
PIKE: How exactly

850
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:54,406
- do you plan on doing this?
- We're gonna be driving

851
00:32:54,408 --> 00:32:55,740
200 miles an hour underneath you.

852
00:32:55,742 --> 00:32:57,309
- What?
- Yeah.

853
00:32:57,311 --> 00:32:58,977
You'll only have seven
seconds to receive that file.

854
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:01,046
Any longer, we're not
gonna get this plane back up,

855
00:33:01,048 --> 00:33:03,181
- and we will crash. 
- On top of us?

856
00:33:03,183 --> 00:33:04,449
That will not happen, most likely.

857
00:33:04,451 --> 00:33:06,651
- Do it in one minute. 
- Roger that.

858
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:08,219
Good luck.

859
00:33:08,221 --> 00:33:10,088
You were in the Air Force, right?

860
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,490
Uh-huh.

861
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:15,226
You-you expect me to sit in this car

862
00:33:15,228 --> 00:33:16,594
while a plane is right over us?

863
00:33:16,596 --> 00:33:17,896
No, you're gonna be standing
up through the sunroof.

864
00:33:17,898 --> 00:33:20,064
Oh, okay. All right, okay, okay.

865
00:33:20,066 --> 00:33:21,666
You-You're gonna have to trust me now.

866
00:33:21,668 --> 00:33:23,701
I will not let anything happen to you.

867
00:33:23,703 --> 00:33:27,138
You're the one that said
you wanted to save everyone.

868
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:31,409
This is our only chance.

869
00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:44,762
Preparing for second approach.

870
00:33:49,234 --> 00:33:51,101
RANDY: Okay, we're in sync
with Mr. O'Brien's laptop.

871
00:33:51,103 --> 00:33:53,037
Let's hope this works.

872
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,959
(engine roaring, tires squealing)

873
00:33:58,076 --> 00:33:59,076
PAIGE:<i> Oh, my God.</i>

874
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,244
- You ready? 
- No...

875
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,445
- Hit the roof panel. 
- No.

876
00:34:01,447 --> 00:34:03,247
Hit the roof panel. Okay, okay.

877
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,529
Do it now!

878
00:34:17,228 --> 00:34:19,963
(breathing deeply)

879
00:34:21,332 --> 00:34:22,666
Oh, my God.

880
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:24,201
Oh, my God!

881
00:34:24,203 --> 00:34:25,502
All right.

882
00:34:25,504 --> 00:34:28,805
(tires squealing)

883
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:40,450
Oh, my God!

884
00:34:40,452 --> 00:34:41,885
CO-PILOT: Come on!

885
00:34:41,887 --> 00:34:42,953
You got to reach it!

886
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,855
I can't reach it!

887
00:34:44,857 --> 00:34:46,556
(groans)

888
00:34:46,558 --> 00:34:47,958
Come on, reach for it. Just try!

889
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,626
Okay.

890
00:34:49,628 --> 00:34:51,161
WALTER: Drop the cable!

891
00:34:51,163 --> 00:34:52,429
Drop it now!

892
00:34:52,431 --> 00:34:54,464
Come on, you got to get it! Now!

893
00:34:54,466 --> 00:34:55,832
Reach!

894
00:34:55,834 --> 00:34:56,800
I got it!

895
00:34:56,802 --> 00:34:57,868
Yes!

896
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,769
I got it! Okay, it's in.

897
00:34:59,771 --> 00:35:01,371
It's downloading, it's downloading!

898
00:35:01,373 --> 00:35:02,839
- What's it say?
- I don't know, uh,

899
00:35:02,841 --> 00:35:04,007
a few seconds; it needs a few seconds.

900
00:35:04,009 --> 00:35:05,041
We're running out of road!

901
00:35:05,043 --> 00:35:06,977
Still loading!

902
00:35:07,979 --> 00:35:09,412
Oh, come on, pal, up...

903
00:35:12,717 --> 00:35:15,318
Just a few seconds! Almost!

904
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,719
Oh, no, no! No, no! No, no, no, no, no!

905
00:35:16,721 --> 00:35:18,188
No, hold on! Walter!

906
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,190
Walter! It's done! Hold on! Hold on to it!

907
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,524
It's going!

908
00:35:21,526 --> 00:35:22,959
(tires squealing)

909
00:35:23,527 --> 00:35:25,361
Got it! (groans)

910
00:35:30,401 --> 00:35:31,467
Look out!

911
00:35:31,469 --> 00:35:33,202
(screaming)

912
00:35:34,905 --> 00:35:36,940
(tires squealing)

913
00:35:41,078 --> 00:35:42,979
We're back on. (cheering)

914
00:35:42,981 --> 00:35:44,847
Mayday, mayday.

915
00:35:44,849 --> 00:35:46,082
Communications restored.

916
00:35:46,084 --> 00:35:47,583
(cheering)

917
00:35:47,585 --> 00:35:49,152
We'll have you all

918
00:35:49,154 --> 00:35:50,987
safely on the ground in moments.

919
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:52,822
Please confirm.

920
00:35:52,824 --> 00:35:54,490
(cheering continues)

921
00:35:54,492 --> 00:35:56,993
Your mom did that.

922
00:36:01,231 --> 00:36:03,032
(coughing, retching)

923
00:36:03,034 --> 00:36:05,368
(laughs)

924
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:15,044
Deal's a deal.

925
00:36:15,046 --> 00:36:18,781
(sighs deeply)

926
00:36:18,783 --> 00:36:20,716
Paige...

927
00:36:20,718 --> 00:36:22,084
she deserves a share.

928
00:36:22,086 --> 00:36:24,120
I'll see to it.

929
00:36:24,122 --> 00:36:25,688
When we worked together,

930
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:28,757
that didn't pan out the
way either of us wanted.

931
00:36:29,526 --> 00:36:30,926
I was hoping,

932
00:36:30,928 --> 00:36:33,162
moving forward, things could be different.

933
00:36:33,164 --> 00:36:35,130
Moving forward?

934
00:36:35,132 --> 00:36:38,000
I came to L.A. to start a
strategic response team.

935
00:36:38,002 --> 00:36:39,702
At any given time, we deal with everything

936
00:36:39,704 --> 00:36:42,137
from stolen nukes to missing kids

937
00:36:42,139 --> 00:36:45,007
to counterfeit cash so good
it can collapse our economy

938
00:36:45,009 --> 00:36:46,976
in less than a month.

939
00:36:46,978 --> 00:36:48,310
The bad guys are getting smarter.

940
00:36:48,312 --> 00:36:51,113
And I can't train my agents
to think like you do.

941
00:36:51,115 --> 00:36:53,916
I have the full resources
of the U.S. government.

942
00:36:53,918 --> 00:36:55,918
I need your help,

943
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,787
and I think you and your team need a home.

944
00:37:06,095 --> 00:37:07,629
Here.

945
00:37:09,799 --> 00:37:13,168
“Fixed salaries, cars,

946
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:15,370
research lab”".

947
00:37:15,372 --> 00:37:18,006
You saw this coming.

948
00:37:18,008 --> 00:37:20,676
It was your only logical move.

949
00:37:20,678 --> 00:37:22,844
(sighs)

950
00:37:37,177 --> 00:37:39,704
Okay, lips are parted,
leaning slightly forward.

951
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:42,464
You have something to tell us.

952
00:37:42,466 --> 00:37:44,399
He offered us jobs.

953
00:37:45,234 --> 00:37:47,469
Me, too?

954
00:37:47,471 --> 00:37:49,671
We're a team, aren't we?

955
00:37:53,142 --> 00:37:55,210
The waitress just left
to bring her son home.

956
00:37:55,212 --> 00:37:56,311
You just missed her.

957
00:37:56,313 --> 00:37:59,047
<i>(knocking on door)</i>

958
00:38:00,216 --> 00:38:01,349
Walter.

959
00:38:01,351 --> 00:38:02,417
Come in.

960
00:38:02,419 --> 00:38:03,551
I know it's, uh, late.

961
00:38:03,553 --> 00:38:04,819
I'm sorry. I just wanted to, um,

962
00:38:04,821 --> 00:38:08,356
say thank you for your help today.

963
00:38:08,358 --> 00:38:10,124
You're welcome.

964
00:38:11,093 --> 00:38:13,595
You came all the way over
here to tell me that?

965
00:38:13,597 --> 00:38:15,597
No, I also wanted to offer you a job.

966
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,465
Government-funded problem solvers.

967
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:20,168
Uh... why?

968
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,370
I'm-I'm not a genius.

969
00:38:22,372 --> 00:38:24,072
No, but you are raising one.

970
00:38:24,074 --> 00:38:26,841
That takes, uh, someone smart, brave...

971
00:38:26,843 --> 00:38:30,278
Now, our work requires, uh,

972
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,345
interaction with people.

973
00:38:31,347 --> 00:38:32,447
It's not our strength.

974
00:38:32,449 --> 00:38:34,515
You want to know about your son,

975
00:38:34,517 --> 00:38:36,951
I can translate him for you.

976
00:38:36,953 --> 00:38:41,522
You translate the world for us.

977
00:38:44,593 --> 00:38:46,227
It's, um...

978
00:38:46,229 --> 00:38:48,162
salary...

979
00:38:48,164 --> 00:38:49,864
plus benefits.

980
00:38:49,866 --> 00:38:52,266
You're worried about not being
able to connect with Ralph.

981
00:38:53,835 --> 00:38:57,038
That is a second chance.

982
00:39:01,276 --> 00:39:03,611
For you, too.

983
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,081
With you and Cabe.

984
00:39:10,585 --> 00:39:14,054
When I was 16, Cabe asked
me to develop tracking software

985
00:39:14,056 --> 00:39:17,224
to drop military aid packages.

986
00:39:17,226 --> 00:39:19,593
So months later, I, uh,

987
00:39:19,595 --> 00:39:21,562
I turned on the TV,

988
00:39:21,564 --> 00:39:24,498
and I saw bombs falling on Baghdad.

989
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,899
They were using my system,

990
00:39:25,901 --> 00:39:29,370
and I designed it for speed over accuracy.

991
00:39:29,372 --> 00:39:33,240
So 2,000 civilians died.

992
00:39:35,643 --> 00:39:37,111
Walter, you...

993
00:39:37,113 --> 00:39:38,579
you were just a kid.

994
00:39:38,581 --> 00:39:40,881
Yeah, so is Ralph.

995
00:39:40,883 --> 00:39:42,883
So tell him to ignore
any sentence that starts

996
00:39:42,885 --> 00:39:45,352
with “normally.”

997
00:39:45,354 --> 00:39:46,687
Make sure that he's not scared

998
00:39:46,689 --> 00:39:49,356
of anything that he's capable of.

999
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:52,826
And he'll find it difficult to make friends,

1000
00:39:52,828 --> 00:39:56,230
and sometimes he'll feel like no one else

1001
00:39:56,232 --> 00:39:57,664
in the world likes him.

1002
00:39:57,666 --> 00:39:59,132
Yeah.

1003
00:39:59,134 --> 00:40:01,935
You just got to make sure that
he knows it's not his fault.

1004
00:40:01,937 --> 00:40:04,905
RALPH: Hi, Walter.

1005
00:40:04,907 --> 00:40:07,074
Hey, Ralph.

1006
00:40:08,876 --> 00:40:12,112
He-he doesn't talk to anyone but me.

1007
00:40:12,114 --> 00:40:14,848
He recognizes one of his own.

1008
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:20,554
May I?

1009
00:40:20,556 --> 00:40:22,522
Thank you.

1010
00:40:27,361 --> 00:40:30,297
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Three, two, one.

1011
00:40:30,299 --> 00:40:34,334
You ever pause your dreams, Ralph?

1012
00:40:34,336 --> 00:40:36,670
Yeah.

1013
00:40:37,471 --> 00:40:39,439
Ever rewind them?

1014
00:40:39,441 --> 00:40:41,608
Sometimes.

1015
00:40:43,778 --> 00:40:46,246
Yeah, me, too.
