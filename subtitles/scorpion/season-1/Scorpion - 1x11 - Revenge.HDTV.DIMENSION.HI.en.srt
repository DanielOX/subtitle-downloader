1
00:00:04,357 --> 00:00:06,023
WALTER:
<i>My name is Walter O'Brien.</i>

2
00:00:06,025 --> 00:00:10,394
<i>I have the fourth highest IQ</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

3
00:00:10,396 --> 00:00:12,096
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

4
00:00:12,098 --> 00:00:14,698
<i>When I was 11, the FBI</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking NASA</i>

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,468
<i>to get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,536
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

7
00:00:19,538 --> 00:00:22,573
<i>tackling worldwide threats</i>
<i>only we can solve.</i>

8
00:00:22,575 --> 00:00:24,341
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

9
00:00:24,343 --> 00:00:26,143
<i>Sylvester's a human calculator.</i>

10
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:28,345
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

11
00:00:28,347 --> 00:00:30,681
<i>Agent Cabe Gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

12
00:00:30,683 --> 00:00:32,916
<i>And Paige?</i>
<i>Well, Paige isn't like us.</i>

13
00:00:32,918 --> 00:00:35,352
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

14
00:00:35,354 --> 00:00:38,055
<i>while we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

15
00:00:38,057 --> 00:00:40,157
<i>Together, we are Scorpion.</i>

16
00:00:41,394 --> 00:00:43,494
Friday's shipment
was late.

17
00:00:43,496 --> 00:00:44,962
I know. Small snafu.

18
00:00:44,964 --> 00:00:47,231
I'll do my best so it won't
happen again, promise.

19
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:49,933
Don't do your best, Gary,
do<i> my</i> best, you understand?

20
00:00:49,935 --> 00:00:50,801
Yes, sir.
MAN: Get down!

21
00:00:50,803 --> 00:00:52,202
Everybody down on the ground!

22
00:00:52,204 --> 00:00:53,070
No one move!

23
00:00:53,072 --> 00:00:54,171
Okay, friend,

24
00:00:54,173 --> 00:00:55,406
we're just a safe
manufacturing company.

25
00:00:55,408 --> 00:00:56,874
We don't actually store...

26
00:00:58,144 --> 00:01:00,577
Anyone else want to
explain things to me?

27
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:01,945
(grunts)

28
00:01:01,947 --> 00:01:04,281
(music playing over speakers)

29
00:01:06,018 --> 00:01:07,418
(music stops)

30
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,153
WOMAN:
Thanks.

31
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:14,958
(people murmuring)

32
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,126
Don't shoot!

33
00:01:16,128 --> 00:01:18,595
I got it.

34
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:22,966
(camera clicking)

35
00:01:41,787 --> 00:01:44,855
Patel, you sneaky little creep.

36
00:01:44,857 --> 00:01:47,691
You think a sniper rocket's
gonna take me out?

37
00:01:47,693 --> 00:01:49,827
Once you think I'm gone,
I come back!

38
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,995
Like herpes.

39
00:01:51,997 --> 00:01:53,497
Couldn't you play
something less violent,

40
00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:54,598
like Mario Bros.?

41
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,666
TOBY:
Quiet, Luigi.

42
00:01:55,668 --> 00:01:57,367
Get ready to feel
some pain, son!

43
00:01:57,369 --> 00:01:58,802
Oh, wow, for a second there,

44
00:01:58,804 --> 00:02:00,404
I thought that Cabe
was interrogating someone.

45
00:02:00,406 --> 00:02:01,605
PAIGE:
Ralph doesn't even

46
00:02:01,607 --> 00:02:03,440
act like this
when he plays this game.

47
00:02:03,442 --> 00:02:05,509
Where is Ralph?
Did you drop him off at school?

48
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:08,245
No. Slept at his
dad's last night.

49
00:02:08,247 --> 00:02:10,347
Oh, that's, um...

50
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:11,715
good they're, um...

51
00:02:11,717 --> 00:02:14,051
getting on well together;
it's positive.

52
00:02:14,053 --> 00:02:15,419
It is. They're connecting.

53
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:18,355
It's... it's really good
for Ralph. And Drew.

54
00:02:18,357 --> 00:02:19,757
Speak of the devil.

55
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,759
Oh, hey, guys.
Hey.

56
00:02:21,761 --> 00:02:23,761
Dad got me an erector set.

57
00:02:23,763 --> 00:02:25,596
What?
That is super cool.

58
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:27,297
Looks like you guys
had a great night.

59
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:28,632
Box looks old.

60
00:02:28,634 --> 00:02:29,767
Well, it's a
collectible.

61
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:31,335
It's one of the first
ones Gilbert made.

62
00:02:31,337 --> 00:02:32,936
I had one when
I was a kid.

63
00:02:32,938 --> 00:02:34,071
That was nice.

64
00:02:34,073 --> 00:02:35,606
Yeah, he likes telescopes.

65
00:02:37,376 --> 00:02:39,543
But it is, um...

66
00:02:39,545 --> 00:02:41,745
it's cool though.

67
00:02:42,681 --> 00:02:45,482
You want to go
play with that?

68
00:02:45,484 --> 00:02:48,085
Could I, um, talk
to you for a second?

69
00:02:48,087 --> 00:02:50,087
Mm-hmm.

70
00:02:50,089 --> 00:02:53,257
(phone ringing)

71
00:02:55,094 --> 00:02:56,894
Cabe.

72
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,730
(quietly): Um, I just wanted
to ask you something.

73
00:02:59,732 --> 00:03:01,031
Oh, I've seen
these guys build

74
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:02,633
a parabolic mic
out of an umbrella.

75
00:03:02,635 --> 00:03:05,102
If they're gonna listen,
they're gonna listen.

76
00:03:07,072 --> 00:03:08,472
Uh... I just wanted to know

77
00:03:08,474 --> 00:03:10,707
if you wanted to have dinner
with me tonight.

78
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:11,975
Oh.

79
00:03:11,977 --> 00:03:13,644
I... I don't know.

80
00:03:13,646 --> 00:03:15,679
I'm not proposing;
it's just dinner.

81
00:03:15,681 --> 00:03:18,615
Since I got back into town,
we haven't had two minutes

82
00:03:18,617 --> 00:03:20,117
just... us.

83
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:24,688
But you and I both know
it's... it's not that simple.

84
00:03:25,858 --> 00:03:27,157
So let me think about it.

85
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,892
Absolutely.

86
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:32,129
Okay.
Okay.

87
00:03:32,131 --> 00:03:33,864
Yeah.
Yeah.

88
00:03:37,503 --> 00:03:39,036
PAIGE:
Hey.

89
00:03:41,307 --> 00:03:42,706
Sylvester?

90
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,007
Yeah?

91
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:46,610
Any reason you're not
making eye contact with me?

92
00:03:46,612 --> 00:03:50,047
Yes. I'm uncomfortable
because we eavesdropped.

93
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:51,281
Way to stay strong, Sly.

94
00:03:51,283 --> 00:03:52,449
It was Toby's idea.

95
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:54,718
You guys fold like a card table.

96
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,453
It's really not a big deal.

97
00:03:56,455 --> 00:03:58,322
His seed blossomed
in your fertile soil.

98
00:03:58,324 --> 00:04:00,591
The emotional bond
between the two of you

99
00:04:00,593 --> 00:04:03,393
is ever present--
it's a huge deal.

100
00:04:03,395 --> 00:04:05,729
What's a huge deal?
Drew asked Paige out.

101
00:04:06,465 --> 00:04:07,698
Oh.

102
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,633
I didn't say yes... yet,

103
00:04:09,635 --> 00:04:12,970
and it's really not a topic
for public consumption.

104
00:04:12,972 --> 00:04:14,171
WALTER:
Yeah, you're right.

105
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:16,073
Besides, we got to focus
on work.

106
00:04:16,075 --> 00:04:17,941
Cabe just called
with a new case.

107
00:04:17,943 --> 00:04:21,879
We can drop Ralph off
at school on the way.

108
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:25,649
Sylvester, stop letting
Toby corrupt you.

109
00:04:30,756 --> 00:04:32,756
(siren wails)

110
00:04:34,526 --> 00:04:36,126
SIMONE:
Gallo.

111
00:04:36,128 --> 00:04:39,296
Well, you look the same as
you did seven years ago.

112
00:04:39,298 --> 00:04:40,631
Not a compliment.

113
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:43,233
Nothing worse than getting
an insult from a lady.

114
00:04:43,235 --> 00:04:45,469
Thank God
it's coming from you.

115
00:04:45,471 --> 00:04:47,371
(laughs)
TOBY: That's nice-- witty banter.

116
00:04:47,373 --> 00:04:49,406
My favorite kind of banter.

117
00:04:49,408 --> 00:04:50,707
Gang, this is

118
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:52,309
Agent Simone Taylor

119
00:04:52,311 --> 00:04:53,443
from Interpol;
we worked

120
00:04:53,445 --> 00:04:56,246
an international task
force seven years ago.

121
00:04:56,248 --> 00:04:57,447
Thanks for coming.

122
00:04:57,449 --> 00:04:59,149
You really think
we're dealing with The Ghosts?

123
00:04:59,151 --> 00:05:01,251
Who are The Ghosts?

124
00:05:01,253 --> 00:05:03,320
They're an international,
incredibly effective,

125
00:05:03,322 --> 00:05:05,455
incredibly brutal
gang of thieves.

126
00:05:05,457 --> 00:05:07,557
Jewels, cash, artwork.

127
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:09,793
If you pay them enough,
they'll steal anything.

128
00:05:09,795 --> 00:05:12,996
And they don't care
who they kill doing it.

129
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,500
Case in point.

130
00:05:17,736 --> 00:05:20,203
They're headed up

131
00:05:20,205 --> 00:05:22,172
by Javier Acosta,
out of Barcelona.

132
00:05:22,174 --> 00:05:23,840
He handpicked his team.

133
00:05:23,842 --> 00:05:26,009
Sounds like a job
for law enforcement.

134
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:27,644
Or Superman.

135
00:05:27,646 --> 00:05:30,180
Law enforcement's been on
this for over a decade

136
00:05:30,182 --> 00:05:31,682
and have gotten nowhere.

137
00:05:31,684 --> 00:05:34,084
Your team is starting
to get a reputation.

138
00:05:34,086 --> 00:05:35,218
A good one?

139
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,453
Yes.

140
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:39,222
Let me show you
the crime scene.

141
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,259
PAIGE:
They make safes here?

142
00:05:42,261 --> 00:05:43,927
Complex security systems.

143
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:47,130
High-end, top of the line,
very expensive.

144
00:05:47,132 --> 00:05:49,032
The Ghosts stole a safe?

145
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:50,767
No, they just
broke into one.

146
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:52,402
The system
they breached,

147
00:05:52,404 --> 00:05:54,504
TD-9000--
brand-new technology,

148
00:05:54,506 --> 00:05:56,974
can be used on
any size vault.

149
00:05:56,976 --> 00:06:00,711
More than a dozen interlocking
composite-steel bolts,

150
00:06:00,713 --> 00:06:04,047
reinforced receiving cups,
ten-gear release mechanism.

151
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:09,032
This could withstand a 9.0 quake
or an industrial thermal lance.

152
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:10,734
Yes, but our
witnesses said

153
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:12,669
they got in with
a glass of water.

154
00:06:12,671 --> 00:06:13,671
Th-They did what?

155
00:06:13,972 --> 00:06:16,840
This... just, um...

156
00:06:16,842 --> 00:06:18,208
this could be a...

157
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,476
a theoretical long shot,

158
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:22,445
but the lock you just described
is as tight as a drum,

159
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:24,848
which has its strengths
and weaknesses.

160
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,983
Now, water,
put in a confined space,

161
00:06:26,985 --> 00:06:29,819
dips a little bit in the
center-- it's called a meniscus.

162
00:06:29,821 --> 00:06:30,920
So the glass goes

163
00:06:30,922 --> 00:06:32,789
on top of the wheel
casing, and then...

164
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,958
And when the notches align,
there's a slight release

165
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,459
in the tension of the gears

166
00:06:36,461 --> 00:06:37,794
that are wound
so tightly

167
00:06:37,795 --> 00:06:41,263
on this bad boy that release
makes the meniscus move,

168
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:42,298
the water ripples,
which means

169
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,800
you've hit
a combination number.

170
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:45,768
CABE:
Some of these systems

171
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,671
can only be purchased by
licensed banking institutions.

172
00:06:48,673 --> 00:06:49,539
Correct.

173
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,773
Since they couldn't test

174
00:06:50,775 --> 00:06:52,408
their water hypothesis at home,
they came to the source.

175
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,910
They saw they were right,
and then they left.

176
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:55,812
Not without killing
innocent people.

177
00:06:55,814 --> 00:06:57,380
Now they're planning
on hitting up

178
00:06:57,382 --> 00:06:59,315
the banks that have
this system in place.

179
00:06:59,317 --> 00:07:01,184
That's the theory
we're working on.

180
00:07:01,186 --> 00:07:03,753
Do you mind if we look
around a little bit?

181
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:06,089
No, go ahead.
Okay.

182
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:10,693
Same as last time--
shrapnel everywhere,

183
00:07:10,695 --> 00:07:12,395
but nothing in the
vault that can help.

184
00:07:12,396 --> 00:07:13,862
Run what you found for DNA.

185
00:07:13,865 --> 00:07:16,165
Even though we both know
what the results will be.

186
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:17,233
Thank you.

187
00:07:17,235 --> 00:07:19,168
Fill me in.

188
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,504
They leave small
metal boxes behind

189
00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:25,341
in the vault-- IEDs filled
with perchloric acid and oil.

190
00:07:25,343 --> 00:07:28,177
A timer pops, the top opens,
setting off an explosion.

191
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:30,947
The acid kills any DNA that
might have been left behind,

192
00:07:30,948 --> 00:07:33,248
and the oil
compromises all prints.

193
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:35,518
Exactly. They're smart.

194
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,886
Maybe.

195
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:39,122
But they ain't smarter
than my guys.

196
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:41,591
WALTER: So, they
came to the source

197
00:07:41,593 --> 00:07:43,826
to run a test.

198
00:07:43,828 --> 00:07:45,828
Scientific... method.

199
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,264
You have to respect
their process.

200
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:50,199
Except for the murder part.

201
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,533
Walter,

202
00:07:51,536 --> 00:07:55,038
I think that going after
these types of people

203
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,373
is not what
we are best suited for.

204
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,709
And it's not just
my fear talking.

205
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:03,179
It's a question of skill sets.

206
00:08:09,187 --> 00:08:11,721
Duly noted.

207
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:14,257
(exhales)

208
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:20,063
Don't touch that!

209
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:29,466

211
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:43,430
Mr. Dodd is alive,
but he's in critical condition.

212
00:08:43,432 --> 00:08:44,832
We've moved Mr. Dodd
into surgery...

213
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,267
Sylvester.
You can call him Sylvester.

214
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:51,004
Sylvester has shrapnel
in his chest and abdomen.

215
00:08:51,006 --> 00:08:52,906
The heat from the explosion
combined with the acid

216
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:55,408
burned through his clothes
and scalded his skin.

217
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,144
The blunt force trauma from
striking his head on the floor

218
00:08:58,146 --> 00:09:00,113
has caused swelling
about the brain

219
00:09:00,115 --> 00:09:01,214
but no focal injury.

220
00:09:01,216 --> 00:09:03,116
H-His brain will recover though?

221
00:09:03,118 --> 00:09:05,485
We won't know the extent
of the damage until he's awake.

222
00:09:05,487 --> 00:09:07,587
Do you think he's
gonna make it?

223
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,522
I don't like to speculate.

224
00:09:09,524 --> 00:09:11,091
Speculate anyway.

225
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,492
I don't think we're
communicating the kind

226
00:09:12,494 --> 00:09:14,594
of mind you're dealing with--
this man is a supercomputer.

227
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,764
He's getting
the best care possible.

228
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,966
Excuse me.

229
00:09:19,968 --> 00:09:22,168
Walter.

230
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,503
Hey, Megan.

231
00:09:23,505 --> 00:09:26,673
She's doing her physical therapy
here in the north wing.

232
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:28,642
She will be
our eyes and our ears.

233
00:09:28,644 --> 00:09:30,043
Meet me at the car.

234
00:09:30,045 --> 00:09:31,411
Wh-Where are we going?

235
00:09:31,413 --> 00:09:33,446
We're gonna work.

236
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,550
Thanks for rushing here.

237
00:09:37,552 --> 00:09:38,885
Yeah. This is so awful.

238
00:09:38,887 --> 00:09:40,553
How is he doing?
Well, he's in surgery.

239
00:09:40,555 --> 00:09:42,656
But you will relay
all information to me?

240
00:09:42,658 --> 00:09:44,224
Anything I hear.

241
00:09:44,226 --> 00:09:46,559
Any decisions that need to be
made, anything on the fly,

242
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:50,296
and you can't contact me,
I need you to think like me.

243
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,666
How would I respond,
what would I ask.

244
00:09:52,668 --> 00:09:55,035
I'll try.

245
00:09:55,037 --> 00:09:56,903
Are you okay?

246
00:09:56,905 --> 00:09:59,372
Yeah, I'm fine.

247
00:09:59,374 --> 00:10:01,508
Okay.

248
00:10:04,913 --> 00:10:07,213
(sighs)

249
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:10,784
There's a reason a cop
gets taken off a case

250
00:10:10,786 --> 00:10:12,085
when his partner
gets wounded.

251
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:13,420
I'm not a cop.

252
00:10:13,422 --> 00:10:16,122
It infuses the investigation
with anger, emotion, revenge.

253
00:10:16,124 --> 00:10:18,758
You get myopic, can't see
the forest for the trees.

254
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,861
See, I don't have
those feelings, so if you...

255
00:10:21,863 --> 00:10:24,731
There is no purpose
to this conversation.

256
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:27,567
If you expect me
to stand down...

257
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:29,803
They put our boy
in the hospital.

258
00:10:29,805 --> 00:10:31,938
There's no way any of us
are gonna stand down.

259
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,940
I'm just bringing it
to your attention.

260
00:10:33,942 --> 00:10:36,409
Keep your focus,
or it'll cost you.

261
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:40,313
Let's find out who else uses
the TD-9000 security system.

262
00:10:40,315 --> 00:10:41,915
That's gonna be
the team's next target.

263
00:10:41,917 --> 00:10:43,550
Let's go.

264
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:49,756
Drexler Bank in Agoura.

265
00:10:49,758 --> 00:10:52,726
Leeside Savings, Burbank.

266
00:10:52,728 --> 00:10:53,827
Toby.

267
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:54,961
Toby?

268
00:10:54,963 --> 00:10:56,296
(snaps fingers)
Toby?

269
00:10:58,567 --> 00:11:00,033
Uh, Business Bank
of Sylmar.

270
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,102
So the sophistication
of the team cuts out

271
00:11:02,104 --> 00:11:04,204
a cash haul--
it's too easy to trace

272
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:05,772
and too hard to carry.

273
00:11:05,774 --> 00:11:07,874
They're after something small--

274
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:08,876
jewels or a hard drive.

275
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,376
Is there any word
from your sister, Walt?

276
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,578
I would've told you.

277
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,514
Now please help me eliminate
these possibilities.

278
00:11:14,516 --> 00:11:16,683
The Ghosts do not
sit on their hands.

279
00:11:16,685 --> 00:11:19,886
Their primary strike
will come very soon.

280
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,955
Uh... okay.

281
00:11:21,957 --> 00:11:24,991
So maybe start
with locations. Um...

282
00:11:24,993 --> 00:11:29,162
Proximity to freeways,
airports, the escape routes.

283
00:11:29,164 --> 00:11:30,864
Then we can calculate
the statistical likelihood

284
00:11:30,866 --> 00:11:33,800
of one site
over another, which...

285
00:11:33,802 --> 00:11:35,435
is Sylvester's forte.

286
00:11:35,437 --> 00:11:36,870
I need to take one minute.

287
00:11:36,872 --> 00:11:39,072
We don't have a minute, Toby.
I'm taking one anyway.

288
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:41,374
I'll be right back.

289
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:43,209
They need to process
what's happened.

290
00:11:43,211 --> 00:11:45,345
No, they need to use
it. Not to be callous,

291
00:11:45,347 --> 00:11:47,814
but they're the perfect
team to be working on this.

292
00:11:47,816 --> 00:11:50,116
Can you think of anyone
else more invested?

293
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:55,990
(exhales)

294
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:59,292
(door opens, closes)

295
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,963
So what's going on, Doc?

296
00:12:03,965 --> 00:12:05,899
Do you think I was
wrong in there?

297
00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:07,600
With Lord Walter?

298
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:11,571
What's the... psychiatric term
for crapping on one guy

299
00:12:11,573 --> 00:12:14,274
when you're upset
about something else?

300
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:16,543
Displacement.

301
00:12:18,747 --> 00:12:22,515
I have known Sylvester
since he was 16 years old.

302
00:12:22,517 --> 00:12:24,984
He once sold his entire
comic book collection

303
00:12:24,986 --> 00:12:27,020
just to cover my rent;
and I always told him

304
00:12:27,022 --> 00:12:28,688
I'll pay him back
for that one day.

305
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,024
And you'll get your chance.

306
00:12:43,738 --> 00:12:46,339
Doctor, how is he?

307
00:12:46,341 --> 00:12:48,641
He's stabilized.
But we won't know

308
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,743
the extent of brain function
till he wakes up.

309
00:12:50,745 --> 00:12:51,911
Oh, God.

310
00:12:51,913 --> 00:12:53,279
Could've been worse.

311
00:12:53,281 --> 00:12:56,082
The one-inch piece of shrapnel
that was threatening his heart

312
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:57,951
lodged in his sternum.

313
00:12:57,953 --> 00:13:00,486
If it hadn't,
he'd be dead.

314
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,689
I'll keep you posted.

315
00:13:04,092 --> 00:13:06,426
Wait.

316
00:13:06,428 --> 00:13:10,730
That piece of shrapnel--
my brother will want to see it.

317
00:13:10,732 --> 00:13:14,334
Nowhere near freeways
or airports.

318
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,369
Leaves us with 38.
Can you please tell Happy

319
00:13:16,371 --> 00:13:18,037
and Toby to get back in here?

320
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,505
They're trying
to work through the fact

321
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,107
their friend's life's in danger.

322
00:13:21,109 --> 00:13:22,675
And so are you,

323
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,244
just in a different way.

324
00:13:24,246 --> 00:13:25,845
Oh.

325
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,013
This branch
was on fire

326
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,047
two weeks ago.

327
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:29,716
It's being rebuilt.

328
00:13:30,585 --> 00:13:31,885
Walter's doing his job,

329
00:13:31,887 --> 00:13:33,686
and he's doing
it well.

330
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,188
When someone's really
focused like this,

331
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,623
it's best to give
them their space.

332
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,858
Sometimes it's better
to give them time.

333
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,227
We have none. The group
who wounded your friend,

334
00:13:41,229 --> 00:13:44,364
they'll disappear into the ether
and then they will kill again.

335
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,672
(monitor beeping steadily)

336
00:13:52,674 --> 00:13:55,108
I've never seen that
before-- the lining.

337
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,577
We've never recovered
a piece of shrapnel

338
00:13:57,579 --> 00:14:00,013
bigger than a millimeter.
And only metal.

339
00:14:00,015 --> 00:14:01,714
I'm sorry, you're gonna
have to clear this hall.

340
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,583
Too many people...
(slaps fire extinguisher)

341
00:14:03,585 --> 00:14:04,817
Okay, we are
busy here.

342
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:05,885
It's okay, sir.

343
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,787
We'll be moving on
in just a moment.

344
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:09,789
It's government business.

345
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,658
Okay, abusing the
fire extinguisher

346
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,459
is another form
of displacement.

347
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:15,161
We deal with stress differently.

348
00:14:15,163 --> 00:14:17,196
You reminisce, I smash things.

349
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:19,399
Happy, what do you get
from this?

350
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:26,039
The Ghosts need an industrial
plastic liner inside those IEDs

351
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:29,876
to keep the acid from eating
through the metal casing.

352
00:14:29,878 --> 00:14:32,412
An explosion
would normally melt it.

353
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:34,414
Well, how'd it survive
this time?

354
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,115
It was in Sylvester.

355
00:14:36,117 --> 00:14:38,217
When the IED exploded,

356
00:14:38,219 --> 00:14:40,820
it superheated
all the metal.

357
00:14:40,822 --> 00:14:43,723
The bits that went
into Sylvester cooled down

358
00:14:43,725 --> 00:14:44,958
from, say, 400 degrees

359
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,693
to 150

360
00:14:46,695 --> 00:14:51,698
very quickly because the human
body is good at absorbing heat.

361
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,466
How does it help us?

362
00:14:53,468 --> 00:14:57,003
Polyethylene plastic is
hard as hell to affix to metal.

363
00:14:57,005 --> 00:14:59,839
There are processes,
especially used in car parts.

364
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:02,909
I know a few guys
who do this quality of work.

365
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,510
But I'll have to
do some research.

366
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:05,645
There's no time.
These guys,

367
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:07,180
how long has each
been in the business?

368
00:15:07,182 --> 00:15:09,449
Uh, one guy, 30 years,
the other two about five each.

369
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:10,616
Well, we'll scratch
the old-timer.

370
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,818
The other two,
either one has kids?

371
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,586
HAPPY:
Neither.

372
00:15:13,588 --> 00:15:15,388
TOBY:
How about doing time?

373
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,756
Dirty John Tucker did a stretch.

374
00:15:16,758 --> 00:15:18,658
The man's name is Dirty
John and he did time.

375
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,393
What the hell
are we playing 20 Questions for?

376
00:15:20,395 --> 00:15:23,463
Good luck with him.
He won't talk.

377
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:25,732
We'll think of something.

378
00:15:25,734 --> 00:15:27,500
We'll make him talk.

379
00:15:30,338 --> 00:15:32,505
(panting)

380
00:15:33,942 --> 00:15:35,842
(shouts)

381
00:15:35,844 --> 00:15:38,077
What the hell
is going on here, man?

382
00:15:40,181 --> 00:15:42,348
All right.
So, good. I...

383
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,584
I guess now you got the
guy who really knows.

384
00:15:44,586 --> 00:15:46,319
I can go?

385
00:15:46,755 --> 00:15:48,054
Shut up.

386
00:15:50,258 --> 00:15:52,925
The only words coming out
of your mouth

387
00:15:52,927 --> 00:15:54,894
need to be concerning this.

388
00:15:56,064 --> 00:15:58,398
And what the hell is that?

389
00:16:00,802 --> 00:16:04,470
It's not gonna be easy
to crack this guy.

390
00:16:04,472 --> 00:16:07,173
I got nothing to say
to you, bud.

391
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:08,508
Nada.

392
00:16:09,444 --> 00:16:10,209
(grunts)

393
00:16:10,211 --> 00:16:11,110
(whimpering)

394
00:16:11,112 --> 00:16:13,346
We've narrowed it down.

395
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,114
One of you two guys,

396
00:16:15,116 --> 00:16:16,716
you built the box

397
00:16:16,718 --> 00:16:19,052
that this shrapnel came from.

398
00:16:19,054 --> 00:16:21,521
And I want you to tell me

399
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:23,689
who it is.

400
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,660
Oh, come on, man.

401
00:16:27,662 --> 00:16:29,095
Are you for real?

402
00:16:29,097 --> 00:16:30,730
I just... I just work
in a plastics factory.

403
00:16:30,732 --> 00:16:32,698
I just want to get out
of here. Please.

404
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:35,068
You want to go first?

405
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,070
No. Please don't.

406
00:16:37,072 --> 00:16:38,771
No.

407
00:16:39,974 --> 00:16:42,075
(whimpering)

408
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,212
Tell me the truth.

409
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,613
I told you,
I didn't make any boxes...

410
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,215
(shouts)

411
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:49,982
Oh, God!

412
00:16:49,984 --> 00:16:52,285
(crying):
Oh, God...

413
00:16:52,287 --> 00:16:54,187
(crying)

414
00:16:54,189 --> 00:16:56,722
I swear it wasn't me!

415
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,057
(crying continues)

416
00:16:59,461 --> 00:17:00,461
Oh, God!

417
00:17:00,462 --> 00:17:03,196
Oh, oh, God!

418
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:05,231
(crying continues)

419
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:08,434
Okay.

420
00:17:08,436 --> 00:17:11,270
Okay, let's talk.

421
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:24,673
Was there a reason
you had a fake blood pack

422
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:26,742
and retractable knife
just lying around?

423
00:17:26,744 --> 00:17:30,012
I had to teach an
old boyfriend a lesson.

424
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:35,717
Okay, guys, I admit
that I build stuff

425
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:37,753
for shady people
from time to time.

426
00:17:37,755 --> 00:17:39,054
Lock picks,

427
00:17:39,056 --> 00:17:40,088
smoke bombs.

428
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,658
Incendiary explosive devices?

429
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:47,162
Those boxes were built
to very detailed specs.

430
00:17:47,164 --> 00:17:48,197
Such as?

431
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:50,566
Heavy polymer lining

432
00:17:50,568 --> 00:17:52,668
used to handle
powerful non-ionized acids

433
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,370
as well as incineration
under high heats.

434
00:17:55,372 --> 00:17:56,972
He ordered 20.

435
00:17:58,042 --> 00:18:00,242
In my game,
it's best you don't know.

436
00:18:00,244 --> 00:18:03,045
Can't imagine
why they call you Dirty John.

437
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:08,350
We need the name of the buyer.

438
00:18:08,352 --> 00:18:10,052
He never gave a name.

439
00:18:10,054 --> 00:18:11,553
Look, he's a handsome dude.

440
00:18:11,555 --> 00:18:14,890
He-he spoke
with a Spanish accent, but...

441
00:18:16,026 --> 00:18:17,192
That's him.

442
00:18:17,194 --> 00:18:18,927
Crazy son of a bitch.

443
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:21,463
(groans) When he showed up
to pick up the package,

444
00:18:21,465 --> 00:18:23,398
I told him
I needed an extra hour.

445
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,002
He went nuts,
shoved a gun right in my mouth.

446
00:18:33,844 --> 00:18:35,143
Something's off.

447
00:18:35,145 --> 00:18:36,712
Javier's cold-blooded,

448
00:18:36,714 --> 00:18:39,581
but shoving guns in people's
mouths sounds emotional.

449
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,650
Javier never loses
his cool.

450
00:18:41,652 --> 00:18:43,552
When you do that,
people remember you.

451
00:18:43,554 --> 00:18:45,854
Exactly. He slipped up,

452
00:18:45,856 --> 00:18:48,624
and now we have everything we
need to find their next target.

453
00:18:48,626 --> 00:18:49,626
How do you figure?

454
00:18:49,627 --> 00:18:51,627
Javier received
20 incendiary devices

455
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:54,162
from Dirty John, but when
The Ghosts hit the safe factory,

456
00:18:54,164 --> 00:18:55,430
they only used 15.

457
00:18:55,432 --> 00:18:56,732
Meaning he has five left.

458
00:18:56,734 --> 00:18:59,101
The Ghosts are nothing
if not efficient.

459
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:00,836
Now, if each incendiary device
wipes out exactly

460
00:19:00,838 --> 00:19:02,204
14-and-a-half feet
of evidence, then...

461
00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:03,605
HAPPY:
We narrow our search

462
00:19:03,607 --> 00:19:06,141
by figuring out which vault
requires exactly five devices.

463
00:19:06,143 --> 00:19:08,944
Happy, we need the blueprints
for every bank on that wall.

464
00:19:08,946 --> 00:19:10,479
Size of the vault
is key.

465
00:19:10,481 --> 00:19:11,647
Already on it.

466
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:13,248
We need to scan
for spatial parameters.

467
00:19:15,219 --> 00:19:18,387
He really is
on fire today.

468
00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:21,723
Fire is exactly
what Sylvester needs.

469
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,663
(monitor beeping steadily)

470
00:19:27,665 --> 00:19:30,198
MEGAN:
Come on, big guy.

471
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,067
Wake up.

472
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:35,304
We were just starting to get
to know each other. (chuckles)

473
00:19:37,107 --> 00:19:39,408
Just open your eyes.

474
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,343
Come on.

475
00:19:41,345 --> 00:19:44,446
Blink for me.

476
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:47,115
Sylvester?

477
00:19:47,117 --> 00:19:48,283
(monitor beeping rapidly)
Sylvester?

478
00:19:48,285 --> 00:19:49,384
(alarm beeping)

479
00:19:49,386 --> 00:19:50,953
Oh, my God. Nurse!

480
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:53,755
Get me two milligrams
of Lorazepam, stat!

481
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:55,857
Pulse is 66 and strong.

482
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:57,426
Intact.
No signs of dehiscence.

483
00:19:57,428 --> 00:20:00,963
MEGAN: That's everything the
doctors have told me so far.

484
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:03,332
How bad was the seizure?

485
00:20:03,334 --> 00:20:05,567
A grand mal

486
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:08,136
caused by the swelling
in his brain.

487
00:20:08,138 --> 00:20:10,172
And what's his status?

488
00:20:10,174 --> 00:20:12,607
They're not sure.

489
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:14,409
No way to tell yet.

490
00:20:16,513 --> 00:20:18,680
I'm sorry, Walter.

491
00:20:18,682 --> 00:20:20,682
Okay, thank you for the update.

492
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,720
We need to keep
it together.

493
00:20:24,722 --> 00:20:26,154
We have to focus.

494
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:28,623
It isn't healthy to pretend
we're not hurting.

495
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,058
You want to talk about hurting?

496
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,827
Sylvester is hurting,

497
00:20:31,829 --> 00:20:33,328
so take a moment if you need to,

498
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,364
and then get back
to scanning those blueprints.

499
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:37,766
Hey, wait.

500
00:20:37,768 --> 00:20:39,034
Let him take a beat.

501
00:20:39,036 --> 00:20:41,036
You have no
idea how close

502
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:42,704
we might be to
catching these guys.

503
00:20:42,706 --> 00:20:44,840
And then what?
You ever think

504
00:20:44,842 --> 00:20:47,009
what we'll do
the day after we catch them?

505
00:20:47,011 --> 00:20:48,176
You can't be so driven

506
00:20:48,178 --> 00:20:49,878
that you don't see
the next step ahead of you

507
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,179
or what you're doing
to other people

508
00:20:51,181 --> 00:20:53,348
while you chase your goal.

509
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:04,159
For me, it's Taekwondo.

510
00:21:04,161 --> 00:21:07,062
But if this<i> Good Will Hunting</i>
thing is how you vent...

511
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:09,197
Whatever works.

512
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:11,033
Just trying to stay sharp.

513
00:21:11,035 --> 00:21:12,134
I get it.

514
00:21:12,136 --> 00:21:14,069
There's a lot more answers
on that board

515
00:21:14,071 --> 00:21:15,404
than there are in your friend's

516
00:21:15,406 --> 00:21:16,738
hospital room.

517
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,774
You're pissed.

518
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:21,410
You know, I don't, uh...

519
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:24,379
I don't... get pissed.

520
00:21:24,381 --> 00:21:25,647
Ah.

521
00:21:25,649 --> 00:21:28,316
Well, you could
have fooled me.

522
00:21:33,424 --> 00:21:35,490
Seven years ago,

523
00:21:35,492 --> 00:21:38,460
my partner and I were tailing
Javier and his crew.

524
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:40,195
When we got close,

525
00:21:40,197 --> 00:21:42,731
they practically cut him
in half with bullets.

526
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:44,833
I'm sorry
about your friend.

527
00:21:44,835 --> 00:21:47,969
He's, uh...

528
00:21:47,971 --> 00:21:51,173
He's spent every day since
in a wheelchair,

529
00:21:51,175 --> 00:21:53,675
drinking meals
through a straw.

530
00:21:56,613 --> 00:21:57,613
(clears throat)

531
00:21:57,614 --> 00:21:59,247
What you're feeling right now,

532
00:21:59,249 --> 00:22:02,084
I still feel every day.

533
00:22:02,086 --> 00:22:04,786
How do you deal with it?
Focus.

534
00:22:04,788 --> 00:22:07,689
For seven years, catching
these guys is the last thing

535
00:22:07,691 --> 00:22:09,891
I think about when I go
to sleep at night

536
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:12,027
and my first thought
when I wake up.

537
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:14,296
I'm not saying
you can't grieve.

538
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:16,765
I'm saying
you can't grieve now.

539
00:22:18,135 --> 00:22:21,069
These people can't get away.

540
00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:24,840
They won't.

541
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:31,480
And when we finally
lock them up...

542
00:22:31,482 --> 00:22:32,981
well, I've been fantasizing

543
00:22:32,983 --> 00:22:35,183
about calling my partner
to give him the good news,

544
00:22:35,185 --> 00:22:40,222
and then finally relaxing
with a stiff drink...

545
00:22:40,224 --> 00:22:43,325
knowing I've done my job.

546
00:22:43,327 --> 00:22:46,695
You know, after
seven years, uh,

547
00:22:46,697 --> 00:22:49,097
you deserve a
stiff drink.

548
00:23:01,812 --> 00:23:03,378
About earlier...

549
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,147
Me, too. Let's move on.
Bigger fish.

550
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:06,414
Okay, what do you got?

551
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:08,250
I just scanned
the last of institutions

552
00:23:08,252 --> 00:23:10,085
with TD-9000 security.

553
00:23:10,087 --> 00:23:12,053
Not a one of them
is small enough

554
00:23:12,055 --> 00:23:13,221
to be completely wiped out

555
00:23:13,223 --> 00:23:15,257
by five of those
acid-bath canisters.

556
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:16,658
Mm.

557
00:23:21,598 --> 00:23:24,099
Maybe we're looking
at this wrong.

558
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:26,801
Maybe when they hit
the safe factory,

559
00:23:26,803 --> 00:23:28,603
it wasn't a test run.

560
00:23:28,605 --> 00:23:30,005
It was an announcement.

561
00:23:30,007 --> 00:23:32,374
They were getting word out
that they cracked the TD-9000,

562
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:34,209
and they were planning
to hit another one.

563
00:23:34,211 --> 00:23:35,410
TOBY: And if you
had something

564
00:23:35,412 --> 00:23:37,679
you knew The Ghosts wanted
in the TD-9000 vault,

565
00:23:37,681 --> 00:23:40,115
you got to move it quick.
And an armored car's

566
00:23:40,117 --> 00:23:42,217
cubic footage can easily
be taken out

567
00:23:42,219 --> 00:23:43,852
by just five of these IEDs.

568
00:23:43,854 --> 00:23:46,188
Boom, now we're cooking
with salt.

569
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,990
HAPPY: Damn right. We start
with this company.

570
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:49,090
The biggest armored car

571
00:23:49,092 --> 00:23:50,892
service in L.A. County.

572
00:23:50,894 --> 00:23:53,028
Well, let's call and see
who got a truck.

573
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:56,198
MAN: I only had one
new booking today.

574
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,333
Safe deposit box move.

575
00:23:58,335 --> 00:24:01,303
Client by the name of Huertavas.

576
00:24:01,305 --> 00:24:02,971
Let me pull up the job details.

577
00:24:02,973 --> 00:24:04,306
Oh, my God.

578
00:24:04,308 --> 00:24:05,974
That's it.

579
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,577
A few years back,

580
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:12,013
a Venezuelan cartel boss named
Huertavas hired The Ghosts

581
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:13,782
to steal a fortune
from his rival.

582
00:24:13,784 --> 00:24:16,351
They grabbed $100
million cash.

583
00:24:16,353 --> 00:24:18,687
Deal was, Ghosts would get
a third cut.

584
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:22,490
Let me guess. Senor Huertavas
wasn't a man of his word.

585
00:24:22,492 --> 00:24:23,625
He double-crossed them.

586
00:24:23,627 --> 00:24:25,360
They barely got out
of Venezuela alive.

587
00:24:25,362 --> 00:24:27,195
Probably right around
the time they swore revenge.

588
00:24:27,197 --> 00:24:29,264
A team on a revenge mission--
sounds familiar.

589
00:24:29,266 --> 00:24:30,799
SIMONE:
Rumor is,

590
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:33,501
Huertavas converted
the cash into diamonds

591
00:24:33,503 --> 00:24:35,770
and hid them
somewhere in the U.S.

592
00:24:35,772 --> 00:24:37,005
A hundred million in diamonds

593
00:24:37,007 --> 00:24:39,040
would fit
into a safe deposit box.

594
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:41,076
I got it. Got it.

595
00:24:41,078 --> 00:24:42,844
Client ordered safe deposit box

596
00:24:42,846 --> 00:24:47,282
number 1840, moved out
from Santa Monica Trust & Loan.

597
00:24:47,284 --> 00:24:48,750
And what time
was the pickup?

598
00:24:48,752 --> 00:24:50,685
Log says it was made
five minutes ago.

599
00:24:50,687 --> 00:24:53,521
Headed east on Olympic now,
turning south on Barrington.

600
00:24:53,523 --> 00:24:54,956
Okay, okay, you need
to call the workers.

601
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:56,091
Tell them they're in danger.

602
00:24:56,093 --> 00:24:59,094
We're on our way.

603
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:03,098
I know we want to get the guys
who hurt Sylvester, but...

604
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,267
let's not forget who we are.

605
00:25:10,207 --> 00:25:12,941
MAN:
Vehicle 117, come in.

606
00:25:12,943 --> 00:25:14,376
(tires screech)

607
00:25:14,378 --> 00:25:15,543
What the hell?!

608
00:25:15,545 --> 00:25:17,946
Vasquez, DeLongpre,
do you copy?

609
00:25:18,915 --> 00:25:20,181
(automatic gunfire)

610
00:25:20,183 --> 00:25:22,817
It's going to give!
We got to return fire!

611
00:25:22,819 --> 00:25:25,020
(automatic gunfire continues)

612
00:25:40,504 --> 00:25:42,904
♪ ♪

613
00:26:09,209 --> 00:26:10,008
(siren wailing)

614
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,443
HAPPY:
There's two down.

615
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:12,844
Animals.

616
00:26:12,846 --> 00:26:15,665
Homeland. You got
a 20 on the perps?

617
00:26:15,665 --> 00:26:17,665
Three bikes fled west on Grand.

618
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:18,833
Highway Patrol's setting up
a roadblock

619
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:20,100
at the Sepulveda Overpass.

620
00:26:20,102 --> 00:26:22,069
They're gonna ditch the bikes
before we get there.

621
00:26:22,071 --> 00:26:24,271
Advantage?
Three-minute head start.

622
00:26:27,042 --> 00:26:29,042
(monitor beeping steadily)

623
00:26:29,044 --> 00:26:31,344
(grunts softly)

624
00:26:31,346 --> 00:26:33,947
Sylvester. Hi!

625
00:26:35,818 --> 00:26:38,652
Oh, thank God you're awake.

626
00:26:38,654 --> 00:26:40,754
Where...

627
00:26:40,756 --> 00:26:42,689
where's Walter?

628
00:26:42,691 --> 00:26:45,859
Right now I think
he's got his hands full.

629
00:26:45,861 --> 00:26:47,027
We got to get them now.

630
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:48,862
Once they hit the freeway
or the hills,

631
00:26:48,864 --> 00:26:50,330
they're too maneuverable
on those bikes.

632
00:26:50,332 --> 00:26:51,565
So we cut them off.

633
00:26:51,567 --> 00:26:52,432
(horns blaring)

634
00:26:52,434 --> 00:26:53,567
Head down to 22nd.

635
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:54,868
Everybody hang on.

636
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,536
(tires screeching)

637
00:26:58,974 --> 00:27:00,674
They're headed right for you.

638
00:27:02,044 --> 00:27:03,310
I see them.

639
00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:09,416
(tires screeching)

640
00:27:12,054 --> 00:27:14,888
Walter, be careful!

641
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,233
You all right?

642
00:27:26,235 --> 00:27:28,368
I wedged my phone
in his backpack.

643
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,803
Nicely done.

644
00:27:29,805 --> 00:27:31,838
WALTER:
Okay, they're going down Tenth.

645
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,373
We can cut them off on Sixth.

646
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:36,276
All right, this is Homeland
Security Agent Cabe Gallo.

647
00:27:36,278 --> 00:27:37,978
The perps are headed
toward Sixth and Tenth.

648

We're on our way.

(sirens wailing)

650
00:27:45,254 --> 00:27:46,987
OFFICER: This is LAPD.
We have no sighting

651
00:27:46,989 --> 00:27:48,622
at Sixth and Tenth Street
location.

652

Wait. That's impossible.

653
00:27:49,825 --> 00:27:51,258
The signal says they're passing
through right now.

654
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,126
They should see
three motorcycles.

655
00:27:53,128 --> 00:27:55,829
I'm not wrong.

656
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:04,137
We're half a mile
from the L.A. Aqueduct.

657
00:28:05,107 --> 00:28:06,506
They're in the sewers.

658
00:28:06,508 --> 00:28:07,707
They're underground.

659
00:28:13,015 --> 00:28:16,950
They're heading down Pico
towards Santa Fe.

660
00:28:16,952 --> 00:28:18,919
According to
the county DWP match,

661
00:28:18,921 --> 00:28:21,655
there's an outlet hatch
by the Sixth Street tunnel.

662
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,063
JAVIER: We ditch the bikes,
and we're gone.

663
00:28:30,065 --> 00:28:31,731
How the hell did he find us?

664
00:28:31,733 --> 00:28:33,833
Surprise, jackass!

665
00:28:33,835 --> 00:28:36,836
Okay, you know what to do.

666
00:28:36,838 --> 00:28:39,839
CABE: You take Javier,
we'll take the other two.

667
00:28:43,645 --> 00:28:45,378
Can't keep up
with these motorcycles.

668
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,212
Let me out.

669
00:28:46,236 --> 00:28:47,582
What?
Let me out.

670
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:49,649
That's Broadway up ahead.
What the hell are you gonna do?

671
00:28:49,651 --> 00:28:51,885
HAPPY:
I'll think of something.

672
00:28:51,887 --> 00:28:54,487
Flushing them back down
toward me.

673
00:28:57,859 --> 00:29:00,493
Oh, come on, come on.

674

Look out! Look out!
(automatic gunfire)

676
00:29:11,974 --> 00:29:13,306
He dropped the gun.

677
00:29:13,308 --> 00:29:16,610
(engine revving)

678
00:29:18,814 --> 00:29:20,780
Okay. Uh...

679
00:29:22,851 --> 00:29:25,752
87 miles per hour, 150 yards.

680

Three, two,

681
00:29:27,956 --> 00:29:29,589

You move, I shoot!

Oh, yeah.

684
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,407
Sometimes you got
to smash stuff.

685
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,883
I'm gonna follow him.

686
00:29:56,885 --> 00:29:59,552
You head to the north side
and head him off.

Yeah, yeah, I made a...

700
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,993
made a move to save
him, and I couldn't.

701
00:31:22,995 --> 00:31:25,162
Right.

702
00:31:28,734 --> 00:31:30,967
Pushed him hard today.

703
00:31:30,969 --> 00:31:33,036
We were all trying
to do the right thing.

704
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:35,939
CABE: Case like this,
if you don't close it,

705
00:31:35,941 --> 00:31:38,842
it becomes a sore--
won't heal.

706
00:31:38,844 --> 00:31:42,312
I didn't want
him to have that.

707
00:31:44,716 --> 00:31:48,552
What happened
on the roof...

708
00:31:48,554 --> 00:31:51,054
I don't feel bad
about what happened.

709
00:31:54,293 --> 00:31:57,561
You know me, I don't... I don't
have those kind of feelings.

710
00:32:01,633 --> 00:32:04,000
I got to go see Sylvester.

711
00:32:12,911 --> 00:32:15,779
Oh, there he is.

712
00:32:15,781 --> 00:32:17,914
Man, you'd just do anything
to get out of work, huh?

713
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:20,383
Hey, pal.

How you doing, kid?

Good. I'm on morphine.

Oh, something I have
owed you for six years.

720
00:32:36,168 --> 00:32:37,467
Super Fun Guy comics.

721

First 50 issues.

722
00:32:39,771 --> 00:32:41,538
Silver Age classics.

723
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,473
Toby, that's
your whole paycheck.

724

I know, and
it's making me sick.

725
00:32:47,546 --> 00:32:50,580
I'm gonna go now,
'cause I'm a doctor,

726
00:32:50,582 --> 00:32:53,250
and I know
you need your rest.

727

Otherwise, I'd be staying
here all night, pal.

00:32:59,691 --> 00:33:01,791
See you tomorrow,
Sylvester.

731
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,696
I'm not gonna kiss you.

732
00:33:06,698 --> 00:33:07,797
(chuckles)
Take care, kid.

733
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,132
Thanks.

734
00:33:10,168 --> 00:33:12,936
So my sister's taking
good care of you?

735
00:33:12,938 --> 00:33:14,771
The best.

736

Yeah, I thought
she would.

Uh, one question before I go.

Um, quick brain teaser,

739

see how the
cranium's feeling.

740

Walter, the doctor
said he's fine.

Fire away.

742
00:33:28,086 --> 00:33:30,720
Okay, so if a man weighing

743
00:33:30,722 --> 00:33:34,791
160 pounds, with an arm span
of 69 inches and a height

744
00:33:34,793 --> 00:33:37,160
of 72 inches reaches
down at a 90-degree

745
00:33:37,162 --> 00:33:40,263
angle to, uh, pick up a man

746
00:33:40,265 --> 00:33:42,532
weighing 200 pounds,
could he lift him?

747
00:33:44,369 --> 00:33:46,169
That's not a brain teaser.

748
00:33:46,171 --> 00:33:48,672
Megan told me what happened
on the roof.

749
00:33:48,674 --> 00:33:51,107
That weight,

750
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:52,943
that angle,

751
00:33:52,945 --> 00:33:55,245
he would have pulled you over.

752
00:33:55,247 --> 00:33:58,448
Right, but I didn't
know that when I, uh...

753
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,183
hesitated.

754
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:13,163
Bye, Megan.

755
00:34:14,566 --> 00:34:16,900
I'll see you
at work, Sylvester.

756
00:34:19,371 --> 00:34:21,438
Okay, so...

757
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,275

00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,975
a new quest for,
uh, justice.

812
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:20,183
Thank you.

813
00:37:20,185 --> 00:37:22,385
Couldn't have
done it without you.

814
00:37:22,387 --> 00:37:24,354
Anytime.

815
00:37:24,356 --> 00:37:26,856
You know where
to find me now.

816
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:35,565
My plane doesn't leave
till the morning.

817
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:39,235
We could take this celebration
back to my hotel.

818
00:37:52,784 --> 00:37:54,284
(sighs)

819
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:59,289
Simone, you're...
you are smart,

820
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:00,890
you're impressive,

821
00:38:00,892 --> 00:38:03,359
you're, uh...
you're beautiful.

822
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:05,595
I'm flattered.

823
00:38:11,469 --> 00:38:13,670
But, um...

824
00:38:15,173 --> 00:38:19,542
...there's somewhere else I-I
feel I need to be tonight.

825
00:38:20,478 --> 00:38:22,078
Okay.

826
00:38:24,816 --> 00:38:27,050
Okay.

827
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:36,793
Hi.

828
00:38:36,795 --> 00:38:39,195
Uh, I'm here
to visit Sylvester Dodd.

829
00:38:39,197 --> 00:38:41,130
Okay, uh, friend or family?

830
00:38:43,535 --> 00:38:45,034
Family.

831
00:38:45,036 --> 00:38:46,769
(monitor beeping steadily)

832
00:38:46,771 --> 00:38:48,638
Hi.

833
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,807
You guys are here, too?

834
00:39:04,422 --> 00:39:06,756
Submit your sitter's bill.

835
00:39:06,758 --> 00:39:09,559
I'll call it research.
We'll get Homeland cover it.

836
00:39:11,696 --> 00:39:14,597
There's the one where Super
Fun Guy meets Dr. Power Pants.

837
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:16,399
We saved this
one for you.

838
00:39:16,401 --> 00:39:18,935
Thanks.

839
00:39:33,018 --> 00:39:39,518
