1
00:00:05,812 --> 00:00:07,479
<i>My name is Walter O'Brien.</i>

2
00:00:07,481 --> 00:00:11,850
<i>I have the fourth highest IQ</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

3
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:13,619
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

4
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:16,221
<i>When I was 11, the FBI</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking NASA</i>

5
00:00:16,223 --> 00:00:18,924
<i>to get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

6
00:00:18,926 --> 00:00:21,026
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

7
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:24,062
<i>tackling worldwide threats</i>
<i>only we can solve.</i>

8
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,831
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

9
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,599
Sylvester's a human calculator.

10
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:29,868
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

11
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,204
<i>Agent Cabe Gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

12
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:34,373
<i>And Paige?</i>
<i>Well, Paige isn't like us.</i>

13
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,775
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

14
00:00:36,777 --> 00:00:39,478
<i>while we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,580
<i>Together, we are Scorpion.</i>

16
00:00:51,324 --> 00:00:53,825
Remind me what we're doing here
in this heat.

17
00:00:53,827 --> 00:00:55,761
Taking a day off.

18
00:00:55,763 --> 00:00:58,931
It's good for you,
clear your head.

19
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:01,333
Passing H.R. B6A
would clear my head.

20
00:01:01,335 --> 00:01:05,203
You ruin my day of sunshine,
and I will fire you.

21
00:01:05,205 --> 00:01:06,872
Aye aye, Congressman.

22
00:01:06,874 --> 00:01:09,274
Go ahead, cast off.

23
00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:12,411
The rope.

24
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:31,096
I can see the appeal
of this place.

25
00:01:31,098 --> 00:01:32,397
You're missing the point.

26
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:34,633
It's about getting away
from it all.

27
00:01:34,635 --> 00:01:37,169
You know,
now that we have some time,

28
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:39,571
I've been meaning
to ask you...

29
00:01:44,377 --> 00:01:47,512
All right. A little to the left.

30
00:01:47,514 --> 00:01:50,716
Keep her coming back. Careful.
This is precious cargo.

31
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:52,384
Happy, just slow
down. Just take your time.

32
00:01:52,386 --> 00:01:54,252
You know how fragile and
important this is, okay?

33
00:01:54,254 --> 00:01:56,188
Keep it coming back.

34
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,190
Straight through.

35
00:02:00,059 --> 00:02:01,994
Hey.
Is that it?

36
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,595
<i>Now, we've all been working</i>

37
00:02:03,597 --> 00:02:05,797
very hard.

38
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:09,735
So, for our reward...

39
00:02:11,637 --> 00:02:13,338
Oh...
Oh!

40
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,740
An authentic original

41
00:02:14,742 --> 00:02:16,908
Proton Arnold cabinet?

42
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,377
Walter, it's beautiful.

43
00:02:20,146 --> 00:02:22,614
It's all original hardware.

44
00:02:22,616 --> 00:02:24,649
It still takes quarters.
You can fix that, right?

45
00:02:24,651 --> 00:02:26,018
Do not insult me.

46
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,085
Cool.

47
00:02:27,087 --> 00:02:28,920
I loved that game.

48
00:02:28,922 --> 00:02:30,555
Hey.
Hey.

49
00:02:30,557 --> 00:02:32,024
Your dad's gonna
take you to school.

50
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,992
Hey.

51
00:02:33,994 --> 00:02:35,460
It's okay.
When you get back from school,

52
00:02:35,462 --> 00:02:36,962
you'll have first game.

53
00:02:36,964 --> 00:02:38,697
Okay? Go.

54
00:02:39,532 --> 00:02:40,866
Before we go,
I just want

55
00:02:40,868 --> 00:02:42,100
to have a quick
word with Walter.

56
00:02:42,102 --> 00:02:44,069
Okay.

57
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,839
Yeah, sure.

58
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:50,442
I used to crush that game.
What was your high score?

59
00:02:50,444 --> 00:02:51,576
Oh, I don't know.

60
00:02:51,578 --> 00:02:53,412
At a certain point,
the counter resets.

61
00:02:54,247 --> 00:02:56,248
Cool.

62
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,649
So, look, I wanted to thank you

63
00:02:57,651 --> 00:02:59,751
for the pitching seminar
we gave Ralph last week.

64
00:02:59,753 --> 00:03:01,653
The kinetic
diagnostic analysis.

65
00:03:01,655 --> 00:03:03,588
Yeah. It's really helped us.

66
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,223
I mean, we do these
game scenarios now.

67
00:03:05,225 --> 00:03:08,260
Like, what's the best opening
pitch with three on, two out,

68
00:03:08,262 --> 00:03:11,263
facing a .280 hitter with
a .330 on-base percentage?

69
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:12,297
That's interesting.

70
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:14,032
Yeah, look, also...

71
00:03:14,034 --> 00:03:16,034
you really helped my delivery.

72
00:03:16,036 --> 00:03:17,135
That early release--

73
00:03:17,137 --> 00:03:19,271
I picked up three miles an hour
on my fastball.

74
00:03:19,273 --> 00:03:20,505
I called my agent.

75
00:03:20,507 --> 00:03:22,707
He got me a tryout
with the Portland Sea Dogs.

76
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:25,544
It's Double-A, but still.

77
00:03:27,013 --> 00:03:28,447
Portland?

78
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:29,514
Mm-hmm.

79
00:03:29,516 --> 00:03:31,750
Does, uh, does Paige
know about this?

80
00:03:31,752 --> 00:03:33,318
Not yet.
Not until it's real.

81
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,754
The only reason I'm telling you
is because you probably know

82
00:03:35,756 --> 00:03:37,856
Ralph's mind
better than anyone.

83
00:03:37,858 --> 00:03:41,359
You're asking what it will
do to him if you leave.

84
00:03:41,361 --> 00:03:43,161
Or bring them with me.

85
00:03:43,163 --> 00:03:45,197
And, look, we're a long
way away from that,

86
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:47,365
and Ralph is
my priority, but...

87
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:50,836
Well, I don't have a ready
answer for you, so...

88
00:03:50,838 --> 00:03:52,137
Well, it's hypothetical,
you know.

89
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:53,705
I still have to try out.

90
00:03:53,707 --> 00:03:55,373
But, um, just think about it.

91
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,109
Okay.
All right?

92
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,844
And keep it
between us.

93
00:03:58,846 --> 00:04:01,012
Mm-hmm.

94
00:04:01,014 --> 00:04:03,148
Ralph, ready?

95
00:04:05,985 --> 00:04:07,085
Bye.

96
00:04:07,087 --> 00:04:09,855
Come on.

97
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,992
Hey.

98
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:17,929
Ride with me to Kovelsky's.

99
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:20,332
Let's grab some bagels
for the team.

100
00:04:25,071 --> 00:04:26,705
I had my eye on
you and Drew.

101
00:04:26,707 --> 00:04:28,006
Looks like you're
getting along well.

102
00:04:28,008 --> 00:04:29,808
Yes.

103
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,977
Real convincing, 197.

104
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:33,979
I'm preoccupied with
a greater good scenario.

105
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:36,281
Complicated by
personal involvement?

106
00:04:36,283 --> 00:04:38,150
I know the challenges
of mentoring

107
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,418
a child genius,
remember?

108
00:04:41,954 --> 00:04:43,788
What's that say?

109
00:04:44,957 --> 00:04:47,058
It's from "R." It says "Gumbo."

110
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,794
Text back: "Confirm."

111
00:04:49,796 --> 00:04:52,297
"Gumbo confirmed."

112
00:04:52,299 --> 00:04:55,066
Whatever I tell you to do, you
just do it for your own safety.

113
00:04:55,068 --> 00:04:56,068
Cabe, what is this?

114
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:57,736
"Gum" is
an emergency code word.

115
00:04:57,738 --> 00:04:58,937
From who? Who's "R"?

116
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:00,939
Questions will be
answered soon enough.

117
00:05:10,383 --> 00:05:12,951
<i>You just did</i>
<i>18 evasive driving maneuvers.</i>

118
00:05:12,953 --> 00:05:14,853
<i>Are you gonna tell me</i>
<i>what's going on?</i>

119
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:16,321
Stay here.

120
00:05:16,323 --> 00:05:17,489
Curb your curiosity.

121
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:18,790
Cabe...

122
00:05:37,376 --> 00:05:39,678
Cabe.

123
00:05:45,051 --> 00:05:49,421
I probably shouldn't have
reached out like this...

124
00:05:49,423 --> 00:05:52,991
out of the blue,
after so much time.

125
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,127
15 years.

126
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:57,862
Your family--

127
00:05:57,864 --> 00:05:59,664
I know you remarried--
are they safe?

128
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,901
My husband took our daughter
back east to look at colleges.

129
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:04,603
I just...

130
00:06:04,605 --> 00:06:06,972
I didn't want to scare them
unnecessarily.

131
00:06:06,974 --> 00:06:09,441
With what? Tell me
what's happening, Rebecca.

132
00:06:09,443 --> 00:06:12,711
I'm in-house counsel
at a big lobbying firm.

133
00:06:12,713 --> 00:06:15,814
I think I stumbled
on something very illegal,

134
00:06:15,816 --> 00:06:18,550
and now I'm in trouble.

135
00:06:18,552 --> 00:06:21,419
You know I would never call you
unless I had to.

136
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:23,588
You can always call me.

137
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:26,024
Cabe...

138
00:06:31,832 --> 00:06:34,199
It's okay. He's with me.

139
00:06:36,035 --> 00:06:37,202
Damn it, Walter.

140
00:06:37,204 --> 00:06:38,870
What are you...?

141
00:06:38,872 --> 00:06:40,372
What is going on here?

142
00:06:40,374 --> 00:06:42,340
Wait, is this...

143
00:06:42,342 --> 00:06:43,608
Walter O'Brien?

144
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,776
Yes, it is.

145
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:46,278
And you are?

146
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,181
This is Rebecca. Burns.

147
00:06:50,183 --> 00:06:52,384
My ex-wife.

148
00:06:56,355 --> 00:06:58,556
Someone's trying to kill her.

149
00:07:00,993 --> 00:07:03,495
Part of my job at
The Barnwright Group

150
00:07:03,497 --> 00:07:06,097
is to review our clients'
PAC contributions.

151
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:08,533
This morning, I came
across a wire transfer

152
00:07:08,535 --> 00:07:12,103
made two weeks ago labeled:
"CA 78 SE"

153
00:07:12,105 --> 00:07:13,038
Okay.

154
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,572
I had no clue
what that meant,

155
00:07:14,574 --> 00:07:16,007
so I opened the file.

156
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:19,077
There were a number of
contributions but no names,

157
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:21,413
which is a huge red flag.

158
00:07:21,415 --> 00:07:23,748
So I copied the file
onto a flash drive

159
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,183
to run it by
our co-counsel.

160
00:07:25,185 --> 00:07:26,918
But when I went
to print it,

161
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,986
the file was gone.

162
00:07:27,988 --> 00:07:29,254
Money laundering?

163
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:30,422
That's my guess.

164
00:07:30,424 --> 00:07:31,756
I guarantee Barnwright

165
00:07:31,758 --> 00:07:33,024
monitors their
whole system.

166
00:07:33,026 --> 00:07:34,459
As soon as you
opened the file,

167
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:36,428
they knew you were
looking at it.

168
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,297
They had an override word
macro triggered to delete it.

169
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:40,465
They certainly knew something.

170
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:41,866
When I packed up to leave,

171
00:07:41,868 --> 00:07:44,469
a security officer in a suit
stopped me in the hall.

172
00:07:44,471 --> 00:07:47,572
I'd never seen him before,
but he had a gun.

173
00:07:47,574 --> 00:07:49,441
He wanted to frisk me,
but a couple of staffers

174
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:51,810
walked by
before he had a chance.

175
00:07:51,812 --> 00:07:53,712
While he was rifling
through my bag,

176
00:07:53,714 --> 00:07:56,147
I dropped the flash drive
in the nearest planter.

177
00:07:56,149 --> 00:07:57,382
That's impressive.

178
00:07:57,384 --> 00:07:59,918
Then when I got home,
I saw a man

179
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,320
walk out of my bedroom
wearing a mask.

180
00:08:02,322 --> 00:08:04,022
He ran at me.

181
00:08:04,024 --> 00:08:06,825
I barely got
to my car.

182
00:08:08,594 --> 00:08:11,162
I didn't know
who else to turn to.

183
00:08:11,164 --> 00:08:15,200
We established the emergency
code word for a reason.

184
00:08:15,202 --> 00:08:17,202
I'm glad you reached out to me.

185
00:08:17,204 --> 00:08:19,504
After all this time, I'm...

186
00:08:19,506 --> 00:08:21,373
I'm just glad you remembered it.

187
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,907
May I see your phone?

188
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,283
Okay.

189
00:08:32,285 --> 00:08:35,320
He's uncouth
but effective.

190
00:08:35,322 --> 00:08:38,656
We're gonna have to get rid
of any trace of you.

191
00:08:38,658 --> 00:08:40,225
We're gonna leave your car.

192
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:41,993
You're gonna ride with us.

193
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,200

195
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:00,909
Here they come.

196
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:03,732
Intelligent eyes.

197
00:09:03,734 --> 00:09:05,185
Clearly has
a wit about her.

198
00:09:05,186 --> 00:09:07,186
Same carriage as Cabe.

199
00:09:07,188 --> 00:09:08,854
They actually
make a good match.

200
00:09:08,856 --> 00:09:11,457
Toby, Happy,

201
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:14,159
Sylvester, Paige.

202
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:15,161
My ex-wife Rebecca.

203
00:09:15,162 --> 00:09:16,328
Wow, Gallo,

204
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,297
you were punching
way above your weight class.

205
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:19,899
Hello.
I'm Sylvester.

206
00:09:19,901 --> 00:09:21,901
I apologize if I am
inordinately anxious.

207
00:09:21,903 --> 00:09:23,035
The pleasure's mine.

208
00:09:23,037 --> 00:09:25,004
What's that?

209
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,139
That is Proton Arnold.

210
00:09:27,141 --> 00:09:28,007
Unplug it.

211
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:29,208
Okay.

212
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,043
I think what
Cabe means to say is,

213
00:09:31,045 --> 00:09:34,079
"I've told my ex-wife
what a great team I work with--

214
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:35,414
smartest I'll ever meet."

215
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,782
You're a Cabe whisperer.

216
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,083
I do the same for them.

217
00:09:38,085 --> 00:09:41,253
All right, now that
the meet and greet's over.

218
00:09:41,255 --> 00:09:46,191
"CA 78 SE"

219
00:09:46,193 --> 00:09:48,394
Decoding that is the key
to the file Rebecca found

220
00:09:48,396 --> 00:09:49,995
and whoever came after her.

221
00:09:49,997 --> 00:09:52,298
"CA" is most likely
California.

222
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,066
78-- a year,

223
00:09:54,068 --> 00:09:55,367
a longitude,

224
00:09:55,369 --> 00:09:57,336
a state highway

225
00:09:57,338 --> 00:09:58,871
or exit on any
interstate.

226
00:09:58,873 --> 00:10:02,308
And "SE" could be southeast,
Southern England.

227
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,510
Or "something else."

228
00:10:04,512 --> 00:10:08,113
California, 78,
something else.

229
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,585
You literally called us on this
three minutes ago.

230
00:10:15,155 --> 00:10:18,524
All Barnwright clients are
multi-billion dollar outfits.

231
00:10:18,526 --> 00:10:19,925
Agricultural companies,

232
00:10:19,927 --> 00:10:21,760
airline unions, 50 others.

233
00:10:21,762 --> 00:10:22,895
Hard to know which one

234
00:10:22,897 --> 00:10:24,563
has their values up their ass.

235
00:10:24,565 --> 00:10:25,831
Boy, you're tough
as nails.

236
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,566
Guess you'd have to be
to be married to Cabe.

237
00:10:27,568 --> 00:10:28,767
Moving on.

238
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:30,736
So, you said when you
returned to your computer

239
00:10:30,738 --> 00:10:32,771
seconds later, the suspicious
file was deleted.

240
00:10:32,773 --> 00:10:35,808
That means whoever set it up
programmed a Trojan horse

241
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,543
to destroy all data viewed
by unauthorized personnel.

242
00:10:37,545 --> 00:10:38,877
The only copy left

243
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:41,613
might be that one you left
in the planter at Barnwright.

244
00:10:41,615 --> 00:10:42,548
Might be,
maybe, could be.

245
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,750
Cabe, you got
to be patient.

246
00:10:44,752 --> 00:10:45,851
Guys, look at this.

247
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,252
Investigators have concluded

248
00:10:47,254 --> 00:10:48,754
that the explosion
was the result

249
00:10:48,756 --> 00:10:50,956
of an equipment malfunction
aboard the vessel.

250
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,525
Congressman Gostin
was a firebrand champion

251
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:54,626
of working people,

252
00:10:54,628 --> 00:10:56,895
making him
a nationally recognized figure,

253
00:10:56,897 --> 00:10:58,030
as well as a local hero

254
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,065
to the constituents
in the 78th District.

255
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:03,335
"CA" stands for California;
"78" stands for 78th District.

256
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:04,870
What does "SE" stand for?

257
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,905
"Special election."

258
00:11:06,907 --> 00:11:10,142
Isn't that what happens when
a congressman dies in office?

259
00:11:10,144 --> 00:11:11,410
That's what I saw in that file--

260
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:12,978
contributions
for a special election.

261
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,279
But a special
election is only held

262
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:17,649
when an incumbent dies
or is removed from office.

263
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:20,552
They removed him
from office.

264
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,921
Whoever created that
account was raising money

265
00:11:22,923 --> 00:11:26,425
to replace Congressman Gostin
before today's accident.

266
00:11:26,427 --> 00:11:29,495
So, either they are
clairvoyant, or...

267
00:11:29,497 --> 00:11:31,263
This was an assassination.

268
00:11:31,265 --> 00:11:33,766
But why start transferring funds
before knocking him off?

269
00:11:33,768 --> 00:11:35,868
You're just putting
yourself in a position

270
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,103
to be caught;
that's not too smart.

271
00:11:38,105 --> 00:11:39,905
A congressman is dead.

272
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,241
Cabe, would now be the time
to call in reinforcements?

273
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,343
We're dealing with one of
the largest lobbying firms

274
00:11:44,345 --> 00:11:45,345
in the country.

275
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:46,512
They have tentacles everywhere--

276
00:11:46,514 --> 00:11:47,980
they pull in
big government money.

277
00:11:47,982 --> 00:11:51,016
Big enough to want
to kill a congressman.

278
00:11:51,018 --> 00:11:53,485
We need to be completely
off the grid on this one.

279
00:11:53,487 --> 00:11:55,687
We have to get ahold of that
drive you left at Barnwright.

280
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:57,122
That's probably
the only way of tracing

281
00:11:57,124 --> 00:11:59,358
whoever wanted Gostin dead.

282
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,559
You still have your I.D.?

283
00:12:00,561 --> 00:12:03,595
I'm sure they deactivated it.

284
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:04,863
Oh, that's right--
you just met us.

285
00:12:04,865 --> 00:12:07,900
Speaking of badges, Cabe,
I'm gonna need yours.

286
00:12:07,902 --> 00:12:10,969
To look at that exploded
boat for proof of foul play.

287
00:12:10,971 --> 00:12:12,604
There'll be security
at the marina.

288
00:12:14,307 --> 00:12:17,543
Since when do you
loan your shield

289
00:12:17,545 --> 00:12:20,079
so people can
impersonate federal agents?

290
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:22,848
Since someone came after you.

291
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,018
I want you by my side;
it's the only place that's safe.

292
00:12:39,732 --> 00:12:41,733
I'm in.

293
00:12:41,735 --> 00:12:43,302
Good.

294
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,837
Making my way
to the fifth floor.

295
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:46,371
Get in and get out, Walter.

296
00:12:46,373 --> 00:12:47,806
No unnecessary risk.

297
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,975
Assume everyone you meet
in that building is a threat.

298
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,643
These the kind of jobs
you guys normally do?

299
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,846
Mm, yeah, we break
and enter a lot.

300
00:12:55,582 --> 00:12:57,282
He was always very gutsy.

301
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,491
So, Rebecca said that there was

302
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,593
a third plant
from the elevator, huh?

303
00:13:07,595 --> 00:13:08,760
That's right.

304
00:13:08,762 --> 00:13:09,862
Make it fast.

305
00:13:09,864 --> 00:13:12,064
Is that your daughter?

306
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:13,332
Joanna.

307
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,600
She's beautiful?

308
00:13:14,602 --> 00:13:16,001
Seventeen.

309
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,604
When I picture that man tearing
through my house this morning,

310
00:13:18,606 --> 00:13:21,607
more than anything, I'm so happy
that she wasn't home.

311
00:13:21,609 --> 00:13:22,941
She was such a cute baby.

312
00:13:22,943 --> 00:13:24,610
Look at those cheeks.

313
00:13:28,848 --> 00:13:30,516
No, that-that's Amanda.

314
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,118
That's our daughter
who passed away.

315
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,722
Oh, I-I'm so sorry
for your loss.

316
00:13:36,724 --> 00:13:38,090
You're very sweet.

317
00:13:38,092 --> 00:13:40,792
So, Cabe, there's nothing
in that planter. Is she sure?

318
00:13:40,794 --> 00:13:42,427
I thought so,
but I was so nervous.

319
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:43,529
He needs to be
careful, Cabe.

320
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,397
These are not good people.

321
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,132
Well, is she sure?

322
00:13:47,134 --> 00:13:49,768
I mean, this is...

323
00:13:51,304 --> 00:13:53,238
Who are you?

324
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,873
Tell him you're looking
for Human Resources

325
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,308
and get out of there now,
Walter.

326
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,411
Hi, I'm Dave
from UCLA botany department.

327
00:13:59,413 --> 00:14:02,714
Operations called about
a-a fungus in the, uh, plants.

328
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,950
That's not what I told you
to say, Walter, damn it!

329
00:14:04,952 --> 00:14:08,787
Well, Dave from UCLA, you're
gonna need to come with me.

330
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:10,155
I'm almost done
with the samples.

331
00:14:10,157 --> 00:14:12,891
Just, uh, one
left actually.

332
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,826
You're done now. Let's go.

333
00:14:14,828 --> 00:14:17,496
Walter, if that's the guy
that tried to frisk Rebecca,

334
00:14:17,498 --> 00:14:19,164
he could be very dangerous.

335
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:22,134
I-I can't do what
you're asking me to do now.

336
00:14:22,136 --> 00:14:24,570
I've... it's almost finished.

337
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,071
Get out of there now, Walter!

338
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,073
Sir.

339
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:39,084
Security breach on five!

340
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,519
Man, blue shirt, gray pants!

341
00:14:40,521 --> 00:14:41,720
Walter, what's happening?

342
00:14:41,722 --> 00:14:43,355
I'm in a bit of a bind here.

343
00:14:43,357 --> 00:14:46,225
But I'm buying some time
by jamming some coins

344
00:14:46,227 --> 00:14:48,393
into the door frame.

345
00:14:50,296 --> 00:14:51,763
That's not gonna hold for long.

346
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,366
That's why I told you
to get out when I did.

347
00:14:55,134 --> 00:14:57,135
Open up!

348
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,839
Open the door!

349
00:15:00,841 --> 00:15:02,174
I have an idea.

350
00:15:02,176 --> 00:15:04,409
You move your car to the side
alley off Fourth Street.

351
00:15:04,411 --> 00:15:05,978
Keep the car running
and stand by.

352
00:15:12,151 --> 00:15:13,218
Okay, we're here.

353
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,988
Where the
hell's Walter?

354
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,223
There.

355
00:15:21,594 --> 00:15:25,597
Oh, my God, Walter,
what are you doing?

356
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:27,599
Son of a bitch!

357
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:29,735
You got to kick it
into high gear, son!

358
00:15:29,737 --> 00:15:32,537
Cut the power to the rig!
Let's get down there.

359
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:35,040
I'll be down in 20 seconds.

360
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:36,875
Ah! They killed the motor.

361
00:15:36,877 --> 00:15:38,677
There's no guarantee.

362
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:40,345
You get arrested,
you're gonna have an accident

363
00:15:40,347 --> 00:15:41,780
before you get
to the police station!

364
00:15:41,782 --> 00:15:42,948
You got to get out!

365
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,116
You know what,
I'm 30 feet above concrete!

366
00:15:44,118 --> 00:15:45,350
Give me time to think!

367
00:15:45,352 --> 00:15:46,852
You don't have any time!

368
00:15:46,854 --> 00:15:48,420
Quiet! I'm doing
my calculations.

369
00:15:48,422 --> 00:15:50,322
Pull your car up
two-and-a-half feet.

370
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,691
Create a freefall, 9.8
meters per seconds squared.

371
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:53,525
Hurry!

372
00:15:53,527 --> 00:15:56,728
What is he doing?

373
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,997
4,000 newtons of energy
to break a leg.

374
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:02,134
I should be okay...

375
00:16:02,136 --> 00:16:04,436
But I'm not paying
for the damage to your car!

376
00:16:07,674 --> 00:16:10,275
Okay, we can go now.

377
00:16:20,553 --> 00:16:21,987
Cabe...
What happened in there?!

378
00:16:21,989 --> 00:16:24,323
We needed this drive.

379
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:26,525
When I tell you to
get out, you get out.

380
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,894
You risked Rebecca's life,
you risked your life,

381
00:16:28,896 --> 00:16:30,429
and now they've seen
your face, Walter!

382
00:16:30,431 --> 00:16:32,464
They've got it on surveillance!

383
00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:34,900
We don't know what
the repercussions are from that!

384
00:16:34,902 --> 00:16:37,903
Cabe...
Hey, it's okay.

385
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:49,915
It's 102 in the Southland today.

386
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:51,583
Hope you brought your sunblock.

387
00:16:51,585 --> 00:16:52,718
That's a good idea.

388
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,486
Did you guys remember
to apply your sunblock?

389
00:16:54,488 --> 00:16:55,787
Yeah, right after
we took our vitamins.

390
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:57,889
Guys, focus.
Right, sorry.

391
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,591
You're the shrink.
I need you on point, Doc.

392
00:16:59,593 --> 00:17:03,362
I'm on it. Based on posture
alone, this guy's an easy mark.

393
00:17:03,364 --> 00:17:04,529
How you doing today?

394
00:17:04,531 --> 00:17:06,331
Good. How you doing?

395
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,367
I'm in a marina
in triple-digit heat.

396
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:09,968
How do you think I'm doing?

397
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,703
Agent Gallo,
Homeland Security.

398
00:17:11,705 --> 00:17:14,439
What kind of name is "Cabe"?

399
00:17:17,477 --> 00:17:19,211
It's "Kah-beh."

400
00:17:20,146 --> 00:17:22,414
My mother's Korean.
Oh, sorry.

401
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,816
I-I didn't mean anything by it.
No one ever does.

402
00:17:24,818 --> 00:17:25,917
This is perfect.

403
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,252
Now he's feeling guilty
and self-conscious.

404
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,453
Drop a little
civics lesson.

405
00:17:28,455 --> 00:17:30,455
I'm here to do
the DHS inspection.

406
00:17:30,457 --> 00:17:31,790
Inspectors were already here.

407
00:17:31,792 --> 00:17:33,625
Local PD was.

408
00:17:33,627 --> 00:17:34,826
Not us.

409
00:17:34,828 --> 00:17:36,294
A congressman died.

410
00:17:36,296 --> 00:17:37,696
Homeland's involved.

411
00:17:37,698 --> 00:17:39,097
This is perfect.
Now he's feeling stupid.

412
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,832
You got him right
where you want him.

413
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:42,534
Now make him insecure.

414
00:17:42,536 --> 00:17:46,304
I have work to do, so should I
call your supervisor or mine?

415
00:17:47,306 --> 00:17:48,874
And shoulders
will be slouching

416
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:51,543
in three, two, one.

417
00:17:54,147 --> 00:17:55,313
This is like
fish in a barrel.

418
00:17:55,315 --> 00:17:57,382
Good talk.

419
00:18:25,845 --> 00:18:28,280
It's clean.

420
00:18:30,082 --> 00:18:32,150
Hey, Happy.

421
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,652
Hey, Walt. How'd you guys do?

422
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,853
Oh, we got the drive,

423
00:18:34,855 --> 00:18:36,221
but we need more evidence.

424
00:18:36,223 --> 00:18:37,355
So how is the marina?

425
00:18:37,357 --> 00:18:38,790
Informative.

426
00:18:38,792 --> 00:18:40,492
I think I have
what you're looking for.

427
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,761
So, small crafts like Gostin's
have gas engines, right?

428
00:18:42,763 --> 00:18:45,263
Their fumes have to be
cleaned out by a motorized fan

429
00:18:45,265 --> 00:18:46,798
to avoid an explosion.

430
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,500
Now, if someone
were to cut the hose

431
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,801
between the motor and the fan...

432
00:18:49,803 --> 00:18:51,169
Fan would still be making noise,

433
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,637
but it wouldn't actually
be blowing any fumes out.

434
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:55,373
Precisely. And if the fumes
aren't being vented, boom.

435
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,142
So, you found a cut fan hose?

436
00:18:57,144 --> 00:18:58,610
Better.

437
00:18:58,612 --> 00:19:00,512
Whoever cut the hose
on the congressman's boat

438
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,780
was smart enough to replace it.

439
00:19:01,782 --> 00:19:03,782
They charred the outside
of the hose

440
00:19:03,784 --> 00:19:06,024
so authorities wouldn't notice
it had been tampered with.

441
00:19:06,263 --> 00:19:08,773
Trouble is, there should've
been fume residue inside.

442
00:19:08,797 --> 00:19:10,797
But the hose is clean.
It's never been used.

443
00:19:10,868 --> 00:19:13,268
It was clearly installed
after the boat exploded.

444
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,337
And a brand-new part
would mean a recent purchase.

445
00:19:15,339 --> 00:19:17,339
So, we just need to link
whoever bought that part

446
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:19,675
to someone on the client roster
of Rebecca's firm.

447
00:19:19,677 --> 00:19:21,410
Happy, we'll meet you
back at the garage.

448
00:19:21,412 --> 00:19:23,078
Race you there.

449
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:28,155
Appreciate the loan.

450
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:31,492
What the hell
happened in here?

451
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,429
I can't believe this.

452
00:19:36,331 --> 00:19:38,699
No. Proton Arnold.

453
00:19:40,101 --> 00:19:41,302
They're onto us.

454
00:19:53,642 --> 00:19:55,149
It's like a tornado
came through.

455
00:19:55,149 --> 00:19:56,815
A tornado that hates computers.

456
00:19:56,817 --> 00:19:57,983
And arcade games.

457
00:19:57,985 --> 00:20:00,519
They took everything--
laptops, hard drives.

458
00:20:00,521 --> 00:20:01,553
Surge protectors.

459
00:20:01,555 --> 00:20:03,188
Who steals
surge protectors?!

460
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,090
It's a good thing our
standard operating procedure

461
00:20:05,092 --> 00:20:06,492
is to heavily encrypt all data.

462
00:20:06,494 --> 00:20:08,627
My house, your garage-- they're
hitting everything today.

463
00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:10,329
Okay, so the question
is: why do all this?

464
00:20:10,331 --> 00:20:12,331
Why not lay in wait

465
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,632
and then take the hard drive?

466
00:20:13,634 --> 00:20:15,234
They know we have it
they'll be back for it.

467
00:20:15,236 --> 00:20:16,335
We need to move.

468
00:20:16,337 --> 00:20:17,803
Oh, God.

469
00:20:17,805 --> 00:20:19,104
I know someplace.

470
00:20:19,106 --> 00:20:21,273
Grab everything
you think you need.

471
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:22,474
We're heading out in 30 seconds.

472
00:20:22,476 --> 00:20:24,143
Hold on, guys.
Cell phones.

473
00:20:24,145 --> 00:20:25,711
On the desk now.

474
00:20:25,713 --> 00:20:27,446
So they can't
be tracked.

475
00:20:27,448 --> 00:20:30,082
Now, we're going off-grid,
but we still need phones. Happy?

476
00:20:30,084 --> 00:20:31,583
I'm on it.

477
00:20:34,721 --> 00:20:36,121
I want to pull Ralph
out of school.

478
00:20:36,123 --> 00:20:37,389
Drew can take him
someplace safe.

479
00:20:37,391 --> 00:20:38,624
That's smart.

480
00:20:38,626 --> 00:20:40,426
It's better to be safe
than sorry.

481
00:20:40,428 --> 00:20:42,261
Untraceable burners.

482
00:20:42,263 --> 00:20:44,797
Great.

483
00:20:45,765 --> 00:20:48,534
All right, let's move out.

484
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:55,474
This is Harriman Road.

485
00:20:56,643 --> 00:20:59,211
We're going to
Jimmy's house.

486
00:21:00,613 --> 00:21:01,647
Who's Jimmy?

487
00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:03,415
No one for you
to worry about.

488
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:20,632
Uninhabited.
What's the story?

489
00:21:20,634 --> 00:21:22,935
We needed off the grid.
That's the story.

490
00:21:24,637 --> 00:21:28,040
Safe house? It's more
like a haunted house.

491
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:30,676
You see what I did there,
right? That's a joke.

492
00:21:43,123 --> 00:21:44,590
My kind of key.

493
00:21:44,592 --> 00:21:47,259
Ms. Quinn, would
you do the honors?

494
00:21:47,261 --> 00:21:49,261
With pleasure.

495
00:21:49,263 --> 00:21:50,896
There you go.

496
00:21:54,434 --> 00:21:57,469
Oh, dear Lord,
thank you for this gift.

497
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,941
Paige, Sylvester, there's
a fuse box and a generator

498
00:22:02,943 --> 00:22:04,977
in the cellar,
down the hall to the right.

499
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:06,111
Sure thing.

500
00:22:06,113 --> 00:22:09,148
Oh, '97-- a fine vintage
for Dinty Moore.

501
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,451
Put that down!

502
00:22:12,453 --> 00:22:14,253
You do understand
that we're hiding?

503
00:22:14,255 --> 00:22:16,121
These people have
technology and connections.

504
00:22:16,123 --> 00:22:18,056
If they want
to find us, they will.

505
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:19,591
We want to wrap
this up fast.

506
00:22:19,593 --> 00:22:22,327
Happy, set up an untraceable
Internet connection.

507
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:23,795
Walter, what's
our plan of attack?

508
00:22:23,797 --> 00:22:26,031
Well, we've got evidence of
the suspicious wire transfer

509
00:22:26,033 --> 00:22:27,866
on the flash drive,
but we need to link it

510
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:29,501
to whoever bought
that hose.

511
00:22:29,503 --> 00:22:32,704
Now, we'll dig into records
of every boat supply store

512
00:22:32,706 --> 00:22:34,740
in southern California
and the top ten

513
00:22:34,742 --> 00:22:35,742
online retailers.

514
00:22:35,743 --> 00:22:37,342
Then, once
we have a list,

515
00:22:37,344 --> 00:22:39,244
we can pull the name
of every Barnwright client

516
00:22:39,246 --> 00:22:40,879
from that flash drive
and compare it

517
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:43,448
with the hose purchasers,
see if anyone overlaps.

518
00:22:45,486 --> 00:22:47,619
Simple human error-- always is.

519
00:22:47,621 --> 00:22:48,587
What is?

520
00:22:48,589 --> 00:22:49,521
The transfer Rebecca saw

521
00:22:49,523 --> 00:22:50,822
for "CA 78 SE"

522
00:22:50,824 --> 00:22:52,591
was made on 11/12.

523
00:22:52,593 --> 00:22:54,993
Safe money's on
a simple digit inversion.

524
00:22:54,995 --> 00:22:57,829
Whoever entered that
meant to do it on 12/11.

525
00:22:57,831 --> 00:22:59,565
After the congressman
was dead,

526
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:01,600
once that special
election had been set.

527
00:23:01,602 --> 00:23:03,702
This whole thing is very
All the President's Men.

528
00:23:03,704 --> 00:23:05,170
I feel like
I'm giving off

529
00:23:05,172 --> 00:23:06,805
a real Robert Redford
vibe right now.

530
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:08,273
You're more of
a Dustin Hoffman.

531
00:23:08,275 --> 00:23:09,441
I will take that.

532
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,777
We got an old saying

533
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:13,946
in law enforcement
about the criminal element:

534
00:23:13,948 --> 00:23:16,048
"Thank God
they're stupid."

535
00:23:20,653 --> 00:23:22,921
Um, start working
on this now.

536
00:23:35,468 --> 00:23:37,502
There is no Jimmy, is there?

537
00:23:37,504 --> 00:23:39,671
This is your house,
yours and Cabe.

538
00:23:39,673 --> 00:23:40,639
How'd you know?

539
00:23:40,641 --> 00:23:42,641
Coffee mug upside down

540
00:23:42,643 --> 00:23:44,910
on a neatly folded paper
towel near the sink.

541
00:23:44,912 --> 00:23:46,812
He does the same thing
every day at the garage.

542
00:23:46,814 --> 00:23:48,180
And your hand
was just shaking.

543
00:23:48,182 --> 00:23:51,116
It hasn't done once all day,
but it was just then.

544
00:23:51,118 --> 00:23:52,517
He always said you were

545
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:54,486
the most observant person
he'd ever met.

546
00:23:54,488 --> 00:23:55,921
Now, he lied
about the house

547
00:23:55,923 --> 00:23:57,322
because he didn't
want us prying.

548
00:23:57,324 --> 00:23:59,424
This is where...

549
00:23:59,426 --> 00:24:01,360
things fell apart.

550
00:24:01,362 --> 00:24:02,928
You don't want
to be here.

551
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,197
We'll work fast.
Walter...

552
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:07,599
You do understand

553
00:24:07,601 --> 00:24:10,335
how important you are to him.

554
00:24:10,337 --> 00:24:12,337
That's what that
was all about,

555
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:14,773
in the car earlier,
when he yelled at you.

556
00:24:14,775 --> 00:24:18,076
He had the same look in his eyes
as he did when we were told

557
00:24:18,078 --> 00:24:21,013
there was nothing more
we could do for Amanda.

558
00:24:21,015 --> 00:24:23,582
He's not just worried
about me today.

559
00:24:23,584 --> 00:24:26,918
He doesn't want
to lose you.

560
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,553
Walter!

561
00:24:35,094 --> 00:24:36,595
List of Californians
who purchased

562
00:24:36,597 --> 00:24:38,697
that exact model hose
in the last three months.

563
00:24:38,699 --> 00:24:39,998
12 people total.

564
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,868
Now, 11 of those buyers paid
with credit or debit cards.

565
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,170
But none of those 11 names
have any direct ties

566
00:24:45,172 --> 00:24:46,872
to Barnwright or
any of their clients.

567
00:24:46,874 --> 00:24:49,274
So we're focusing on the
one cash transaction.

568
00:24:49,276 --> 00:24:51,376
Okay, so that's got to be
our guy. What store?

569
00:24:51,378 --> 00:24:53,745
Lake and Ocean Boat Supplies
in Marina Del Rey,

570
00:24:53,747 --> 00:24:56,615
two weeks ago at 3:15.

571
00:24:56,617 --> 00:24:58,517
Sylvester, can you access
their security archive footage?

572
00:24:58,519 --> 00:24:59,951
On it.

573
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,627
This is her personal drive.

574
00:25:08,629 --> 00:25:10,929
There's a lot more on here
than just the Barnwright file.

575
00:25:10,931 --> 00:25:14,032
There's a folder
full of letters to you.

576
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:16,468
Multiple drafts,
going back almost 15 years.

577
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:19,938
I only read the first sentence,
when I realized what it was.

578
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:23,041
I thought you should
read it for yourself.

579
00:25:31,552 --> 00:25:34,286
Checked up on your family.

580
00:25:34,288 --> 00:25:36,088
But they made all
their appointments.

581
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,389
They're at
their hotel now.

582
00:25:37,391 --> 00:25:38,423
Thank you.

583
00:25:38,425 --> 00:25:41,093
I appreciate it.

584
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:43,395
When we split up,

585
00:25:43,397 --> 00:25:45,664
you let me have everything.

586
00:25:45,666 --> 00:25:48,133
All you asked for
was this house.

587
00:25:48,135 --> 00:25:50,635
Don't forget about
the '73 Le Mans.

588
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:58,443
I always assumed
you'd sell the place.

589
00:25:58,445 --> 00:26:00,612
No, I'll never sell it.

590
00:26:05,985 --> 00:26:07,919
This is where she took
her first steps.

591
00:26:07,921 --> 00:26:11,690
This is where
she died.

592
00:26:13,426 --> 00:26:15,894
It's killing
me to be here.

593
00:26:15,896 --> 00:26:19,531
Right now, this is
the safest place.

594
00:26:19,533 --> 00:26:22,734
I was so impressed
with you today.

595
00:26:22,736 --> 00:26:24,903
I thought, there's
the man I married,

596
00:26:24,905 --> 00:26:26,772
there's that swagger.

597
00:26:26,774 --> 00:26:28,807
I feel safe.

598
00:26:30,576 --> 00:26:33,879
But then... this.

599
00:26:33,881 --> 00:26:37,749
It brought up all
these old feelings.

600
00:26:37,751 --> 00:26:39,584
From when I couldn't
count on you.

601
00:26:39,586 --> 00:26:42,187
Cabe. We got... something.

602
00:26:48,795 --> 00:26:51,163
I'm fine.

603
00:26:51,165 --> 00:26:53,432
I just need to
get some air.

604
00:27:01,007 --> 00:27:03,241
Belongs to you.

605
00:27:11,984 --> 00:27:15,253
Here's the archived footage
from the boat supply store.

606
00:27:15,255 --> 00:27:16,555
Scanning the
date and time

607
00:27:16,557 --> 00:27:18,590
- of when the pipe was purchased...
- Stop.

608
00:27:18,592 --> 00:27:21,026
What's that?

609
00:27:21,028 --> 00:27:22,394
There's our man.

610
00:27:22,396 --> 00:27:24,896
Got him.

611
00:27:24,898 --> 00:27:26,698
Does he pop up
in DMV records?

612
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,000
No, but he pops up
somewhere else.

613
00:27:29,002 --> 00:27:31,403
Meet our buyer,
one Anthony Cole.

614
00:27:31,405 --> 00:27:33,205
That name showed up
in the clients

615
00:27:33,207 --> 00:27:35,640
I pulled from
Rebecca's flash drive.

616
00:27:35,642 --> 00:27:38,243
Barnwright represents a
big agribusiness venture

617
00:27:38,245 --> 00:27:39,478
called SunDorna Farms.

618
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,146
There's a Cole high
up in that company.

619
00:27:41,148 --> 00:27:42,814
You are correct.

620
00:27:42,816 --> 00:27:45,650
Ben Cole, VP of Operations
at SunDorna Farms.

621
00:27:45,652 --> 00:27:47,752
Brother of the man
who purchased that hose.

622
00:27:47,754 --> 00:27:50,088
But Anthony doesn't work
for the family business.

623
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:52,557
No, he's been working
on quite the record.

624
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,359
Theft, aggravated assault...

625
00:27:54,361 --> 00:27:56,194
Hang on a second.
You just said "farm."

626
00:27:56,196 --> 00:27:58,296
What...
this is about farms?

627
00:27:58,298 --> 00:27:59,731
No, this is
about water.

628
00:27:59,733 --> 00:28:02,033
It seems like the congressman
was a fierce defender

629
00:28:02,035 --> 00:28:03,668
of small farmer water rights.

630
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,237
Defending them from what?

631
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:07,873
Big agribusiness,
like SunDorna.

632
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:10,509
They need the water, and Gostin
was trying to push through

633
00:28:10,511 --> 00:28:11,877
a water redistribution bill.

634
00:28:11,879 --> 00:28:13,345
He was gonna turn off the tap.

635
00:28:13,347 --> 00:28:14,679
And at
stake for SunDorna?

636
00:28:14,681 --> 00:28:15,647
More than $5 billion

637
00:28:15,649 --> 00:28:17,048
in lost venue.

638
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,483
Less water, fewer crops.

639
00:28:18,485 --> 00:28:20,519
Fewer crops, less money--
simple math.

640
00:28:20,521 --> 00:28:22,554
Gostin was taking cash
out of their pockets,

641
00:28:22,556 --> 00:28:24,222
so the company
and their lobbyists

642
00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:25,790
just took matters
into their own hands.

643
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:27,659
And with Gostin dead,
and a more agreeable party

644
00:28:27,661 --> 00:28:29,728
taking over
after a special election,

645
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:32,330
that water redistribution bill
will not pass.

646
00:28:32,332 --> 00:28:33,332
SunDorna and

647
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:34,766
Barnwright make billions.

648
00:28:34,768 --> 00:28:36,334
We've got our smoking gun.

649
00:28:36,336 --> 00:28:38,870
We've I.D.'d the killers, we've
got the evidence to back 'em up.

650
00:28:38,872 --> 00:28:40,872
We're going to the FBI.

651
00:28:40,874 --> 00:28:42,541
Cabe!

652
00:28:50,449 --> 00:28:52,684
No. No!

653
00:28:52,686 --> 00:28:55,320
Yeah, they slashed
all eight tires.

654
00:28:55,322 --> 00:28:56,888
Rebecca.

655
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:58,089
Catching up's gonna
be a challenge.

656
00:28:58,091 --> 00:28:59,791
Maybe not.

657
00:28:59,793 --> 00:29:01,726
Happy, come with me.

658
00:29:01,728 --> 00:29:05,330
You got three minutes
to get her running!

659
00:29:05,332 --> 00:29:07,666
All I need is a wrench.
Okay.

660
00:29:07,668 --> 00:29:09,234
You three, go inside.

661
00:29:09,236 --> 00:29:10,236
Track the vehicle.

662
00:29:10,237 --> 00:29:11,303
Red sedan, four-door.

663
00:29:11,305 --> 00:29:12,904
There's a strip of rust
on the trunk,

664
00:29:12,906 --> 00:29:14,205
roughly four feet across.

665
00:29:14,207 --> 00:29:16,308
We'll access the CalTrans
cameras and find the car.

666
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,876
How the hell
did they find us?

667
00:29:17,878 --> 00:29:19,444
We were so careful.
We were.

668
00:29:19,446 --> 00:29:21,413
Who knows what kind
of access they have?

669
00:29:22,648 --> 00:29:24,282
Hey. Cabe.

670
00:29:24,284 --> 00:29:26,151
Look at me.

671
00:29:27,386 --> 00:29:29,087
We will find her.

672
00:29:41,794 --> 00:29:42,993
Guys, what do you got?

673
00:29:42,995 --> 00:29:44,061
Picture's up, Walt!

674
00:29:44,063 --> 00:29:45,129
We've got a visual

675
00:29:45,131 --> 00:29:46,664
on a ten-mile radius
around this house.

676
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:48,566
We're scanning for
that red car now.

677
00:29:48,568 --> 00:29:50,601
We're about a mile
from half a dozen

678
00:29:50,603 --> 00:29:52,269
freeway exchanges;
they could either be going

679
00:29:52,271 --> 00:29:53,571
to the coast or the desert.

680
00:29:53,573 --> 00:29:54,738
You got 45 seconds

681
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,440
to tell us if we're
heading north or south.

682
00:29:56,442 --> 00:29:57,541
It's a whole mess
of cars out there.

683
00:29:57,543 --> 00:29:59,076
It's really tough
to spot the red ones.

684
00:29:59,078 --> 00:30:01,812
Try this: lay a color filter
over the video feeds.

685
00:30:01,814 --> 00:30:02,880
Good idea.

686
00:30:02,882 --> 00:30:04,348
Then we can highlight
the red cars,

687
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,117
make the kidnappers' car
easier to spot.

688
00:30:08,386 --> 00:30:09,353
Nice.

689
00:30:09,355 --> 00:30:11,989
Red station wagon.
Red V6 pickup.

690
00:30:11,991 --> 00:30:13,924
Oh, come on, rusty
four-door, where are you?

691
00:30:13,926 --> 00:30:16,127
Ooh, we got a live one!

692
00:30:16,129 --> 00:30:16,994
Ah!

693
00:30:16,996 --> 00:30:18,395
Red car,

694
00:30:18,397 --> 00:30:19,897
rust patch on the trunk!
That's the one!

695
00:30:19,899 --> 00:30:20,998
They're headed south

696
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,766
on the I-5. South!
Hang on.

697
00:30:25,404 --> 00:30:26,971
They're passing
the Sylmar exit.

698
00:30:26,973 --> 00:30:29,240
That's about five and a half
miles from here.

699
00:30:29,242 --> 00:30:30,474
They're going faster
than I anticipated.

700
00:30:30,476 --> 00:30:31,909
But just over the speed limit.

701
00:30:31,911 --> 00:30:33,077
They don't want
to attract attention.

702
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,645
Just haul ass,
and you can catch up.

703
00:30:34,647 --> 00:30:36,780
They'll kill her and bury her
where no one can find the body.

704
00:30:36,782 --> 00:30:38,916
Cabe, that's not gonna happen.

705
00:31:02,073 --> 00:31:03,140
We got 'em.

706
00:31:03,142 --> 00:31:04,542
Think they see us?

707
00:31:05,043 --> 00:31:07,478
Whoa!

708
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,712
Yes.

709
00:31:16,388 --> 00:31:18,222
Cabe, they're turning off.

710
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:20,791
Hold tight, Walter!

711
00:31:40,445 --> 00:31:41,946
Cabe?

712
00:31:41,948 --> 00:31:44,114
Cabe? Cabe?

713
00:31:44,116 --> 00:31:46,450
Cabe, wake up. Cabe!

714
00:31:46,452 --> 00:31:48,052
Cabe!

715
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:51,388
Walter, are you guys okay?

716
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,390
Yeah. We're alive.

717
00:31:53,392 --> 00:31:55,826
You still have eyes
on that car?

718
00:31:55,828 --> 00:31:58,262
We lost visual
when they turned off

719
00:31:58,264 --> 00:32:01,298
on Araiza Boulevard, eastbound.

720
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,434
Go get us a car.

721
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:16,347
What the hell?!

722
00:32:16,349 --> 00:32:18,215
Homeland Security!

723
00:32:18,217 --> 00:32:19,450
Sorry, it's a national
emergency.

724
00:32:19,452 --> 00:32:20,985
Need to commandeer
your vehicle.

725
00:32:20,987 --> 00:32:23,254
Come on. Sorry.

726
00:32:23,256 --> 00:32:25,589
Let's go. Let's go.

727
00:32:30,862 --> 00:32:32,396
Guys, can you slow them down?

728
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:33,731
Already done. Happy dropped

729
00:32:33,733 --> 00:32:35,332
a railroad crossing arm
up ahead.

730
00:32:35,334 --> 00:32:36,900
Traffic snarled
to a dead stop.

731
00:32:36,902 --> 00:32:38,369
They'll want
to keep on moving,

732
00:32:38,371 --> 00:32:41,171
and the only other option
is the service road.

733
00:32:41,173 --> 00:32:43,073
But it's green all day,
so guaranteed

734
00:32:43,075 --> 00:32:44,942
they're burning rubber.
Drive fast!

735
00:32:51,117 --> 00:32:53,217
There they are.

736
00:33:04,362 --> 00:33:06,163
Got to do something
to make them stop.

737
00:33:06,165 --> 00:33:08,165
Rebecca in the car,
I can't risk taking a shot.

738
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:10,334
I'm thinking PIT maneuver.
You're thinking right.

739
00:33:10,336 --> 00:33:12,236
Walter, do you know
how to do a PIT maneuver?

740
00:33:12,238 --> 00:33:13,737
PIT: Precision
Immobilization Technique.

741
00:33:13,739 --> 00:33:16,106
It's how the Highway Patrol
stops a fleeing car.

742
00:33:16,108 --> 00:33:17,508
I've read about them
extensively.

743
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,575
Oh, my God!

744
00:33:18,577 --> 00:33:20,511
You got this?
With a little help.

745
00:33:20,513 --> 00:33:21,845
Happy, based on
the make and model,

746
00:33:21,847 --> 00:33:23,580
how do I make their tires
lose their bead?

747
00:33:23,582 --> 00:33:26,583
Just strike the bumper
at a 32-degree angle.

748
00:33:26,585 --> 00:33:27,885
Ideal impact point?

749
00:33:27,887 --> 00:33:29,153
15 inches from the back bumper,

750
00:33:29,155 --> 00:33:31,121
while traveling
at approximately...

751
00:33:31,123 --> 00:33:32,156
Oh, God.

752
00:33:32,158 --> 00:33:33,090
68 miles an hour!

753
00:33:33,092 --> 00:33:34,725
You ready?
Yeah.

754
00:33:34,727 --> 00:33:35,793
You can do this.

755
00:33:35,795 --> 00:33:37,695
Here we go.

756
00:34:04,574 --> 00:34:06,507
Let me see your hands!

757
00:34:06,509 --> 00:34:07,842
Get rid of that weapon!

758
00:34:07,844 --> 00:34:09,243
Out of the car!
Get over here!

759
00:34:09,245 --> 00:34:10,644
On your knees!

760
00:34:13,016 --> 00:34:14,215
Hey.

761
00:34:15,183 --> 00:34:17,385
Cabe.

762
00:34:31,099 --> 00:34:32,266
How'd it go?

763
00:34:32,268 --> 00:34:34,635
I'm a lawyer. I know my way
around a deposition.

764
00:34:34,637 --> 00:34:36,337
What about the men
who took me?

765
00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:40,241
Singing like the Beach Boys,
trying to cut a deal.

766
00:34:40,243 --> 00:34:43,744
I can't wait to watch
that whole company go down.

767
00:34:43,746 --> 00:34:44,779
Where's Walter?

768
00:34:44,781 --> 00:34:46,247
Cleaning up.

769
00:34:46,249 --> 00:34:48,449
He's a good young man.

770
00:34:48,451 --> 00:34:49,483
The best.

771
00:34:49,485 --> 00:34:51,385
You were tough on him today.

772
00:34:51,387 --> 00:34:52,586
Yeah, well.

773
00:34:52,588 --> 00:34:54,155
You were tough on all of them.

774
00:34:54,157 --> 00:34:56,090
Yeah, well.

775
00:34:57,859 --> 00:35:00,628
I'm sorry for
how I spoke to you earlier.

776
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,196
You have every right

777
00:35:02,198 --> 00:35:05,499
to live, to grieve,
however you like.

778
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:08,669
I abandoned you after she died.

779
00:35:08,671 --> 00:35:11,338
All those assignments overseas
that I said were mandatory,

780
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,740
I lied.

781
00:35:14,476 --> 00:35:18,345
It's an ugly thing
that I live with.

782
00:35:18,347 --> 00:35:19,747
Today I couldn't
bear the thought

783
00:35:19,749 --> 00:35:21,115
of letting you down again.

784
00:35:21,117 --> 00:35:24,018
Becca,

785
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:27,855
I know you've moved on,

786
00:35:27,857 --> 00:35:31,792
but I have to ask you...

787
00:35:31,794 --> 00:35:34,128
do you ever think about us?

788
00:35:35,964 --> 00:35:38,799
You're the love of my life.

789
00:35:40,902 --> 00:35:44,472
I've thought about you
for 15 years.

790
00:35:44,474 --> 00:35:47,741
Tried to write you
a hundred letters.

791
00:35:50,645 --> 00:35:53,547
But I think everything
happens for a reason.

792
00:35:53,549 --> 00:35:56,083
I have to,

793
00:35:56,085 --> 00:35:58,686
or I can't make sense
of what happened to Amanda.

794
00:35:58,688 --> 00:36:02,456
Besides, I have
a family now.

795
00:36:08,597 --> 00:36:10,798
So do you.

796
00:36:12,701 --> 00:36:14,935
Sell the house.

797
00:36:14,937 --> 00:36:16,871
Maybe someday.

798
00:36:19,608 --> 00:36:22,109
You were always really badass.

799
00:36:29,784 --> 00:36:32,486
Take care of him for me.

800
00:36:32,488 --> 00:36:35,322
Okay.

801
00:36:43,398 --> 00:36:45,366
You did right by her.

802
00:36:45,368 --> 00:36:46,600
She's safe.

803
00:36:46,602 --> 00:36:50,771
I always put my
job before her.

804
00:36:52,607 --> 00:36:54,742
The real shame of it is:

805
00:36:54,744 --> 00:36:58,579
the only thing I was ever really
better at than being a Fed

806
00:36:58,581 --> 00:37:00,147
was being a father.

807
00:37:00,149 --> 00:37:03,817
For what it's worth,

808
00:37:03,819 --> 00:37:08,022
when I was young,
you were like a father to me.

809
00:37:09,758 --> 00:37:13,060
Sometimes you still are.

810
00:37:13,062 --> 00:37:15,062
Cabe!

811
00:37:15,064 --> 00:37:17,598
It is a good thing
those jerks didn't

812
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,935
steal my blowtorch, or
they'd have a real problem.

813
00:37:20,937 --> 00:37:23,938
Hey, Cabe,
I'm completing an inventory

814
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,306
of all purloined equipment;

815
00:37:25,308 --> 00:37:28,175
and I expect the government
to compensate us in full.

816
00:37:28,177 --> 00:37:29,743
Homeland will
foot the cost.

817
00:37:29,745 --> 00:37:32,947
Okay, I'm gonna pad
this bill a little.

818
00:37:37,419 --> 00:37:40,054
Ralph. Hey.

819
00:37:45,595 --> 00:37:47,194
Thank you, pal.

820
00:37:47,196 --> 00:37:49,964
They really messed
up the garage.

821
00:37:49,966 --> 00:37:51,532
Yeah, they sure did.

822
00:37:51,534 --> 00:37:53,400
You know, I'm gonna
have to rebuild this game.

823
00:37:53,402 --> 00:37:54,368
Do you want to help me?

824
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:56,804
Yeah.
Okay.

825
00:37:56,806 --> 00:37:58,939
Sit down.

826
00:37:58,941 --> 00:38:00,674
Here, hold that.

827
00:38:00,676 --> 00:38:02,376
Another time, Ralph.

828
00:38:02,378 --> 00:38:06,146
Your mom says time
to start packing up.

829
00:38:09,818 --> 00:38:11,785
How's it going?

830
00:38:11,787 --> 00:38:13,354
What happened in here?

831
00:38:13,356 --> 00:38:15,856
It was a high-stress day.

832
00:38:15,858 --> 00:38:17,391
But that's behind us now.

833
00:38:17,393 --> 00:38:18,359
Got it.

834
00:38:18,361 --> 00:38:19,693
Then I'm not gonna bother you

835
00:38:19,695 --> 00:38:21,028
about that thing
we talked about before.

836
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,696
I don't have an answer for you.

837
00:38:22,698 --> 00:38:24,298
No, it's okay.
Yeah, I mean...

838
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,833
Ralph is my priority.

839
00:38:25,835 --> 00:38:28,302
I'm just trying
to do right by the kid.

840
00:38:28,304 --> 00:38:29,370
You and me both.

841
00:38:29,372 --> 00:38:31,171
All right.

842
00:38:36,778 --> 00:38:38,646
We, um... are gonna
get some food.

843
00:38:38,648 --> 00:38:39,947
Do you want to join us?

844
00:38:39,949 --> 00:38:42,583
Oh, um...

845
00:38:42,585 --> 00:38:44,518
I'm-I'm not hungry, thanks.

846
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,452
Okay.

847
00:38:45,454 --> 00:38:47,488
Bye.
Bye.

848
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,690
Bye, Ralph.
Bye.

849
00:38:56,899 --> 00:38:59,633
I don't know about you,
but I could go for a burger.

850
00:38:59,635 --> 00:39:01,869
Oh, I'm starving.

851
00:39:07,142 --> 00:39:09,276
Sorry about your Le Mans.

852
00:39:09,278 --> 00:39:12,746
Happy said
she'd fix it.

853
00:39:12,748 --> 00:39:16,750
So what if there was
a scenario where, um...

854
00:39:16,752 --> 00:39:18,552
Drew takes Ralph?

855
00:39:18,554 --> 00:39:20,020
Takes him where?

856
00:39:20,022 --> 00:39:21,221
Just a hypothetical.

857
00:39:21,223 --> 00:39:23,557
To another city.

858
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:26,460
I wouldn't jump off
the bridge just yet.

859
00:39:26,462 --> 00:39:29,129
There was a time when I wasn't
sure if I'd see you again.

860
00:39:29,131 --> 00:39:32,499
Different circumstances,
of course, but... I had faith

861
00:39:32,501 --> 00:39:35,235
that we'd meet
another day.

862
00:39:37,072 --> 00:39:40,007
Appreciate what you said earlier
about me being a father to you,

863
00:39:40,009 --> 00:39:42,843
even if it was said
in the heat of the battle.

864
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:47,781
Well, you know me.

865
00:39:47,783 --> 00:39:51,418
When have I ever said
anything I didn't mean?

866
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:10,562
Good Burger.

867
00:40:13,509 --> 00:40:20,009
