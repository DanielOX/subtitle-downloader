1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,021
<i>My name is Walter O'Brien.</i>

2
00:00:06,023 --> 00:00:10,358
<i>I have the fourth highest IQ</i>
<i><i><i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,127
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

4
00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:14,729
<i>When I was 11,
the FBI</i> <i>arrested me for hacking NASA</i>

5
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:17,432
<i>to get their blueprints</i> <i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,634
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

7
00:00:19,636 --> 00:00:21,102
<i>tackling worldwide threats</i>

8
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,570
<i>only we can solve.</i>

9
00:00:22,572 --> 00:00:24,339
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

10
00:00:24,341 --> 00:00:26,107
<i>Sylvester's a human calculator.</i>

11
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,410
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

12
00:00:28,412 --> 00:00:30,712
<i>Agent Cabe Gallo's</i> <i>our government handler.</i>

13
00:00:30,714 --> 00:00:32,914
<i>And Paige?</i> <i>Well, Paige isn't like us.</i>

14
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,450
<i>She's normal</i> <i>and translates the world for us</i>

15
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:38,019
<i>while we help her understand</i> <i>her genius son.</i>

16
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:40,154
<i>Together, we are Scorpion.</i>

17
00:00:46,524 --> 00:00:49,115
<i>C-note says</i>
he cuts down the alley.

18
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:50,708
Theory? He stopped.

19
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,610
With fear there's this impulse to freeze,

20
00:00:52,612 --> 00:00:53,911
an innate belief one can avoid detection.

21
00:00:53,913 --> 00:00:57,715
You ever catch a kid with
his hand in the cookie jar?

22
00:00:57,717 --> 00:00:59,483
I'm in for a hundred.

23
00:00:59,485 --> 00:01:02,186
Agents are moving in.

24
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,990
Got him.

25
00:01:06,992 --> 00:01:08,692
- Hey, uh... 
- No, no, no, no, no!

26
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:09,893
My analysis was right.

27
00:01:09,895 --> 00:01:11,528
He was about to go in the alley.

28
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,429
Operative words:

29
00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:13,897
“About to.”

30
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:14,898
Pay up.

31
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,000
So far, we're batting a thousand.

32
00:01:17,002 --> 00:01:18,869
So far.

33
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,270
Glad we could help.

34
00:01:20,272 --> 00:01:22,806
Uh, we did more than help.

35
00:01:22,808 --> 00:01:25,609
Without us tracing the IP
address of that Chinese national,

36
00:01:25,611 --> 00:01:28,945
you'd still have military
intel leaking like a sieve.

37
00:01:28,947 --> 00:01:31,541
Maybe it's time that we
got some publicity on this?

38
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:33,450
Not likely. It's hush-hush.

39
00:01:33,452 --> 00:01:36,820
Ah, it's always hush-hush, huh?

40
00:01:36,822 --> 00:01:38,722
It's the nature of the governmental beast.

41
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:39,956
Going away?

42
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:42,092
Yeah, we took a private job.

43
00:01:42,094 --> 00:01:44,194
A Vegas casino... the Crimson.

44
00:01:44,196 --> 00:01:46,563
They've been losing money
on their high-roller

45
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:47,731
blackjack tables.

46
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,099
They just want an analysis.

47
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:50,433
Same-day trip.

48
00:01:52,136 --> 00:01:54,771
Can I have a word with you, in private?

49
00:01:57,842 --> 00:02:00,477
you're not ready to go out on your own.

50
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,412
You only have a few cases under your belt.

51
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:03,947
We've delivered results every time.

52
00:02:03,949 --> 00:02:05,982
With government assistance.

53
00:02:05,984 --> 00:02:07,917
How well was Scorpion
doing before I came along?

54
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,853
Classified Homeland Security jobs

55
00:02:09,855 --> 00:02:12,155
don't allow us to show
people what we're capable of.

56
00:02:12,157 --> 00:02:14,090
But I've got an investment in you guys,

57
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,458
and I don't want it compromised.

58
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,128
I've had an investment

59
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,997
in this team for years.

60
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:22,465
I see its potential.

61
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:24,634
Now, we agreed to work <i>with</i> the government,

62
00:02:24,636 --> 00:02:25,835
not<i> for</i> the government.

63
00:02:25,837 --> 00:02:28,771
We<i> can</i> take private jobs, so we are...

64
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,541
whether you think we're ready or not.

65
00:02:35,612 --> 00:02:36,846
<i>Tick-tock, people!</i>

66
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:39,182
We're burning daylight here!

67
00:02:39,184 --> 00:02:42,874
Hey, Diana Ross, they have hand soap there.

68
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,333
Not anti-bacterial.

69
00:02:44,335 --> 00:02:47,403
Toby,
I need you to run a point on casino employee

70
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:48,971
background checks, from the garage.

71
00:02:48,973 --> 00:02:51,306
From the garage at the Crimson?

72
00:02:51,308 --> 00:02:53,575
No, this garage.

73
00:02:53,577 --> 00:02:54,977
I'm sorry... for a second,

74
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:56,879
that sounded like you were
saying I can't go to Vegas.

75
00:02:56,881 --> 00:02:58,347
I'm telling you I need you here.

76
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:00,749
Guys, maybe we can talk this out upstairs.

77
00:03:00,751 --> 00:03:02,651
This is a private job, Cabe's not involved

78
00:03:02,653 --> 00:03:04,920
so I am the boss, and I don't want anything

79
00:03:04,922 --> 00:03:06,989
to possibly jeopardize our contract.

80
00:03:06,991 --> 00:03:10,892
Oh...oh, me being involved 
jeopardizes the gig?

81
00:03:10,894 --> 00:03:12,227
I'll stay.

82
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:13,695
No... you want to avoid the flight,

83
00:03:13,697 --> 00:03:15,163
your gambling is a liability.

84
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:16,998
You will become distracted in Vegas,

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,967
and we need to put our best foot forward.

86
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:20,936
Walter, come on...
you waited till the last minute

87
00:03:20,938 --> 00:03:22,137
to tell him about this?

88
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:23,472
I knew this would happen.

89
00:03:23,474 --> 00:03:25,073
This job is a big deal for us.

90
00:03:25,075 --> 00:03:26,775
It's a big deal for all of us.

91
00:03:26,777 --> 00:03:27,909
Sylvester doesn't want to fly,

92
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:29,911
I'm anxious as hell about leaving Ralph

93
00:03:29,913 --> 00:03:32,013
with a sitter while I'm
in a different state...

94
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:33,181
you are worried about Toby.

95
00:03:33,183 --> 00:03:34,449
We're all anxious.

96
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:36,818
But we're all going as a team, okay?

97
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,786
Fine.

98
00:03:37,788 --> 00:03:39,721
You know what? You can be the one

99
00:03:39,723 --> 00:03:42,283
who gives him a loan at the craps table.

100
00:03:52,902 --> 00:03:54,903
Oh, do you hear that?
Do you know what that sound is?

101
00:03:54,905 --> 00:03:56,938
Daddy losing the mortgage payment?

102
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,574
The sound of money, soon to be my money.

103
00:03:59,576 --> 00:04:00,842
You know they have magic shows here.

104
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:02,143
Maybe we can go see one.

105
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:05,146
Ugh. I'm not gonna go anywhere
with you in that shirt.

106
00:04:05,148 --> 00:04:07,015
I can't help it if flying makes me sick.

107
00:04:07,017 --> 00:04:08,783
That shirt makes me sick.

108
00:04:08,785 --> 00:04:11,452
Oh, when we're done,
I am gonna make my own magic

109
00:04:11,454 --> 00:04:13,655
at the card tables.

110
00:04:13,657 --> 00:04:15,456
You wanna bet?

111
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,725
You resist gambling

112
00:04:17,727 --> 00:04:20,061
while you're here,
I will give you my paycheck for this job.

113
00:04:20,063 --> 00:04:23,364
But, if you make a single wager...

114
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:25,166
I will get yours.

115
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:27,001
Yeah, you think you're smart

116
00:04:27,003 --> 00:04:28,269
betting me I won't bet.

117
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:29,570
Mm!

118
00:04:29,572 --> 00:04:32,473
I'm in, 'cause the only thing sweeter

119
00:04:32,475 --> 00:04:34,542
than winning cash will
be winning it from you.

120
00:04:34,544 --> 00:04:35,510
We're on.

121
00:04:35,512 --> 00:04:37,211
- Mr. O'Brien?
- Yes.

122
00:04:37,213 --> 00:04:38,412
Renee Connelly. We spoke on the phone.

123
00:04:38,414 --> 00:04:39,480
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

124
00:04:39,482 --> 00:04:40,482
- Uh, this is my team... 
- Hi.

125
00:04:40,483 --> 00:04:41,515
We're excited to get started.

126
00:04:41,517 --> 00:04:42,683
We're excited to have you.

127
00:04:42,685 --> 00:04:45,586
My father Bob was very
impressed by your proposal.

128
00:04:45,588 --> 00:04:47,388
Specifically, your statistical game theory

129
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,023
and analysis of behavioral patterns.

130
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:51,392
Now, we're really hoping
you can help us find out

131
00:04:51,394 --> 00:04:52,927
why our highest-take tables

132
00:04:52,929 --> 00:04:53,894
are down 1.8 percent,

133
00:04:53,896 --> 00:04:56,230
when we have a house edge of .28%

134
00:04:56,232 --> 00:04:58,299
with a standard deviation of 1.15.

135
00:04:58,301 --> 00:04:59,633
You know your numbers.

136
00:04:59,635 --> 00:05:01,535
Been in the family business since I was 15.

137
00:05:01,537 --> 00:05:03,404
Know it like the odds of a dealt straight.

138
00:05:03,406 --> 00:05:05,439
254 to one.

139
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:07,641
Remind me to keep you
guys away from our tables.

140
00:05:07,643 --> 00:05:09,410
No, no, no, we're here to work.

141
00:05:09,412 --> 00:05:12,213
We'll just get settled
in our room and start.

142
00:05:12,215 --> 00:05:13,981
- Did you book a room? 
- Yes.

143
00:05:13,983 --> 00:05:16,617
Oh, no, no, we have that all taken care of.

144
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:18,686
My dad's been trying to get

145
00:05:18,688 --> 00:05:21,555
a 50,000-square-foot
expansion off the ground...

146
00:05:21,557 --> 00:05:23,123
concerts, private events...

147
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,025
he's spread himself so thin,
you can see right through him.

148
00:05:25,027 --> 00:05:26,593
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

149
00:05:26,595 --> 00:05:29,029
We can't really afford to
lose a dime at the tables.

150
00:05:29,031 --> 00:05:31,198
Okay, guys,
while your suite's being prepared,

151
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,067
we have reserved this cabana for you.

152
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:34,735
All meals are on us,
so just make yourselves at...

153
00:05:35,805 --> 00:05:36,870
Hold on one moment, please.

154
00:05:36,872 --> 00:05:37,971
Okay. Thank you.

155
00:05:37,973 --> 00:05:40,574
Oh! Wouldn't want these to go to waste. Mmm!

156
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:43,610
It's mojito, it's very good.

157
00:05:43,612 --> 00:05:44,678
Guys, can we dial it down a notch, please?

158
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,481
Paige, help me out here.

159
00:05:47,707 --> 00:05:49,883
What? I'm a single mom.

160
00:05:49,885 --> 00:05:50,984
I'm never coming back here.

161
00:05:50,986 --> 00:05:52,152
Okay, guys, my dad's in a meeting,

162
00:05:52,154 --> 00:05:53,854
but I can get you up to the penthouse now.

163
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:54,955
Yes, please. Thank you.

164
00:05:54,957 --> 00:05:57,397
Yes? Okay. Right this way. Lead the way.

165
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,659
What do you think?

166
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:00,761
Well, this is subtle.

167
00:06:00,763 --> 00:06:03,030
I'm so happy.

168
00:06:03,032 --> 00:06:04,831
If you need anything,
Miss Connelly said

169
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:05,932
you should call her personally,

170
00:06:05,934 --> 00:06:06,967
and she'll take care of it.

171
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:08,468
Thank you.

172
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,138
I have waited for this my whole life.

173
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,941
Can you take a quick pic,
so I can text it to Ralph?

174
00:06:14,943 --> 00:06:16,309
Oh, wait... here.

175
00:06:19,114 --> 00:06:21,948
I don't believe it.

176
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,149
This bed is sterile.

177
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:24,718
Let's see what's on the no-pay-per-view.

178
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,420
'Cause it's comped... get it?

179
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:30,290
Dude...?!

180
00:06:30,292 --> 00:06:32,492
Dude... we're here to work,

181
00:06:32,494 --> 00:06:34,127
remember?

182
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:39,499
Now, there's 1.65 times 10
to the 365th power decks

183
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:40,567
in a six-deck shoe.

184
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:42,402
We need to know all of them to find out

185
00:06:42,404 --> 00:06:43,736
why the Crimson is losing money.

186
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:47,607
Only you could turn
blackjack into math homework.

187
00:06:47,609 --> 00:06:49,108
I like math homework.

188
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:52,011
Hi, Renee.

189
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:53,780
I was wondering if we could meet

190
00:06:53,782 --> 00:06:55,048
with him sooner rather than later?

191
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,317
Yes! Yeah. Great. Thank you.

192
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:00,286
Okay, guys, let's uh...  let's go.

193
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:02,155
Yeah! Wouldn't want to 
spend more than two minutes

194
00:07:02,157 --> 00:07:04,717
in the luxury suite. Let's go.

195
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,497
That's $100 a square yard.

196
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:13,633
How much are you losing per day,
at the tables?

197
00:07:13,635 --> 00:07:15,601
Fair enough.

198
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:18,404
Now, to avoid the cost of
re-wiring your ceiling cams,

199
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:20,306
these pressure pads, going under the carpet,

200
00:07:20,308 --> 00:07:22,942
will be linked to a Brownian
motion program I developed.

201
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:24,310
It's based on the principle that people

202
00:07:24,312 --> 00:07:27,013
naturally move in random patterns.

203
00:07:27,015 --> 00:07:28,681
Well, what if they move
around in non-random patterns?

204
00:07:28,683 --> 00:07:30,383
Then they're ripping you off.

205
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,419
where the hell's my money gone?

206
00:07:33,421 --> 00:07:34,720
Sylvester?

207
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:37,890
Okay, 11 players at three tables,
some multiple hands,

208
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:40,292
player success rate is above standard,

209
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,293
but the wage rate hasn't deviated,

210
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,294
since face card turnover's low.

211
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,196
Okay, so no card counters.

212
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:45,664
Toby, what about dealer collusion?

213
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,800
I'm not reading any distraction behavior.

214
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:51,737
Dealer shuffles look standard,
per normalizer.

215
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:53,205
No second deals,

216
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:55,674
high-low pickups, or card swaps.

217
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,576
All right,
pattern from the pressure pads

218
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:58,877
shows randomized movement,

219
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,447
so no one seems to be signaling
a player from a distance.

220
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:03,769
I'm sorry, do you have any 
other angles on that table?

221
00:08:04,406 --> 00:08:07,586
Move cameras 14 and 15 to
high-roll blackjack two.

222
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:09,121
Can you zoom in his hands?

223
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:11,256
Zoom in on that.

224
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,061
That dealer right there.

225
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:19,131
Him...
he's the reason why you're losing money.

226
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,673
Mr. Connelly, what's going on?

227
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:29,708
I didn't do anything, I swear.

228
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,909
Yeah, Ronny, uh...

229
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:32,311
I got an expert here

230
00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:34,846
who says your table's been losing us money.

231
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,181
I got a family, I need this job.

232
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,382
I wouldn't steal.

233
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:38,517
Oh, no... no, no.

234
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,851
He was telling the truth.

235
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,353
He wasn't stealing.

236
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:42,587
Can I see your hands, please?

237
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:45,123
Yes? Uh... thank you.

238
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,391
Yeah, yeah.

239
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:48,994
Now, despite Ronny's stature,

240
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:50,495
he has below-average sized hands,

241
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:52,197
which result in small index fingers,

242
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,032
which result in slow dealer speed.

243
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,067
Which results in fewer deals per hour.

244
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:58,370
Which results in cumulatively large losses.

245
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,872
I'm losing money
'cause this guy's got small mitts?

246
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,941
Yeah, but I just saved you
a fortune in future losses.

247
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:04,442
You just have to fire this gentleman.

248
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,444
What?! It's nothing personal.

249
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:09,180
You're just not fit for
jobs where hand speed,

250
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:10,181
dexterity are paramount.

251
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,883
You're a detriment here.

252
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,854
I'm sorry, Ronny.

253
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:18,356
Mr. Connelly...

254
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:19,891
Please...

255
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,292
This isn't right! This isn't fair!

256
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:24,729
Hey... quick rundown. Mm-hmm?

257
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:25,730
Mm-hmm.

258
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,332
You were rude to Toby at the garage,

259
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:29,968
insensitive to Sylvester's fear of flying,

260
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,703
and uncaring about that dealer's livelihood.

261
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:34,138
We were hired to solve a problem,
which we did,

262
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,808
like professionals, which we are.

263
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,412
So we've upgraded your security software.

264
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,381
You should be more secure
than you were yesterday.

265
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,583
Terrific job.
You know, it's rare these days

266
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,919
somebody actually delivers on
everything they've promised.

267
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:48,920
Thank you.

268
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:49,921
Well, that's very kind of you.

269
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:50,955
Call us whenever you need us.

270
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:51,889
We will.

271
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:52,924
- Okay. Hey. 
- Thank you.

272
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,625
Great job.

273
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:57,595
Well, I can't wait to leave.

274
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,498
The smoke in these places makes me dizzy.

275
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,566
We've got some time
before the plane departs.

276
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,034
I'm gonna go hit up some slots.

277
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,602
No, no, no,
you need to remove the pressure pads.

278
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,037
There's enough time

279
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,171
for her to both, Walter.

280
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,139
The job's over.

281
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,540
Let your team have some fun.

282
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,676
Okay, fine. I'm sorry.

283
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,711
Go have fun, I'll pack up.

284
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,446
I'll go with you...
I told Ralph I'd play a couple games.

285
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,580
Fine.

286
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,215
But if she's a cooler, I'm peeling off.

287
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,718
Hey, they face the loosest
slots towards the entrance

288
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,486
to draw in players, so...

289
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:24,955
I'm like a blind man at a peep show.

290
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,023
What's the point? Mm.

291
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:32,029
Grandma won a
$40,000 progressive jackpot.

292
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,597
Isn't that nice?

293
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,733
Guys, those two men in baseball hats,

294
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,568
they're going against the
grain of the crowd movement.

295
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,503
They're up to something.

296
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,705
Rigid body language,
heads down, checking phones,

297
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,267
clearly anticipating something.

298
00:10:47,245 --> 00:10:48,445
Be cool, guys.

299
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,581
A robbery's about to go down.

300
00:10:51,349 --> 00:10:53,751
Everyone on the ground!

301
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,188
Watch out!

302
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,491
Stay down! Stay down!

303
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,360
Stay down! Don't look up! Stay down!

304
00:11:06,097 --> 00:11:07,397
If I see eyes,

305
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,500
I'm putting a bullet in them!

306
00:11:13,404 --> 00:11:18,959
sync and corrections by <font color="#FF0000">dreaMaker7</font>
www.addic7ed.com

307
00:11:34,457 --> 00:11:36,457
It could have been me.

308
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:38,076
Thank you.

309
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,111
Don't get sappy about it.

310
00:11:40,113 --> 00:11:42,480
I calculated the trajectory of
the bullet and muzzle length,

311
00:11:42,482 --> 00:11:44,582
relative to the position of your torso.

312
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:46,050
It was physics, not heroics.

313
00:11:46,052 --> 00:11:48,653
And you knew it would only
graze the guy behind me?

314
00:11:48,655 --> 00:11:50,221
I didn't calculate his position.

315
00:11:50,223 --> 00:11:51,484
I'm a genius, not Superman.

316
00:11:51,514 --> 00:11:52,713
Walter.

317
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:54,081
This is Detective Lou Rake.

318
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,449
- Oh, hi, Detective.
- Yeah, how you doing, Mr. O'Brien?

319
00:11:55,451 --> 00:11:56,717
Good. Tell me what you saw.

320
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:58,786
Uh, yes, before the gunmen entered,

321
00:11:58,788 --> 00:12:02,790
there were two men, baseball caps,
casing the money cart.

322
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:06,326
So, we know the masked men
entered through the main lobby.

323
00:12:06,328 --> 00:12:07,628
The odd thing is,

324
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,030
the exterior cameras
didn't see them leaving.

325
00:12:10,032 --> 00:12:11,899
No sign at all.

326
00:12:11,901 --> 00:12:13,267
They could still be in the casino?

327
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:15,302
Well, unis are doing a second sweep,

328
00:12:15,304 --> 00:12:17,371
but it's more likely they left another way.

329
00:12:17,373 --> 00:12:18,572
How is that possible?

330
00:12:18,574 --> 00:12:19,640
You tell me.

331
00:12:19,642 --> 00:12:21,208
You're the ones that came here,

332
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,910
got involved with the security
system just before the robbery.

333
00:12:23,912 --> 00:12:25,379
Oh, are you kidding me?

334
00:12:25,381 --> 00:12:28,215
Mr. Connelly, you can't think I
have anything to do with this?

335
00:12:28,217 --> 00:12:30,617
Those cameras you asked
to be turned on a table

336
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:32,652
created a temporary blind spot.

337
00:12:32,654 --> 00:12:33,887
Oh, I was just doing my job.

338
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:36,289
Now I'm just out ten million bucks.

339
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,191
You... what did you see?

340
00:12:38,193 --> 00:12:40,327
Uh, uh, uh. He's already vomited once today.

341
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:42,329
He was face-down on the
floor like everyone else.

342
00:12:42,331 --> 00:12:43,463
What could he see?

343
00:12:43,465 --> 00:12:44,564
That's it. That's it.

344
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:46,233
We were all on the ground. No one moved

345
00:12:46,235 --> 00:12:48,034
except for the robbers. We still have

346
00:12:48,036 --> 00:12:49,669
those heat sensors under the carpet.

347
00:12:49,671 --> 00:12:54,074
But the software shows footsteps
coming into... this room

348
00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:55,308
at the time of the robbery?

349
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,376
There has to be a back exit.

350
00:12:56,378 --> 00:12:58,478
No. It's a storage room.

351
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,746
One door.

352
00:12:59,748 --> 00:13:01,047
Why would they come in here?

353
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:03,283
Well, maybe to put on
your invisibility cloaks?

354
00:13:03,285 --> 00:13:05,752
For the last time,
we had nothing to do with the robbery.

355
00:13:05,754 --> 00:13:07,020
Uh, sir?

356
00:13:07,022 --> 00:13:08,488
We were able to isolate something

357
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,290
- on the casino's mics. 
- Oh, play it, play it.

358
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:11,291
Yes, sir.

359
00:13:11,293 --> 00:13:12,592
Be cool, guys.

360
00:13:12,594 --> 00:13:15,128
A robbery's about to go down.

361
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,667
No, no.

362
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:21,768
I was just...

363
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,037
No, I know, you were just settling your crew

364
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,638
before your pals came in with guns.

365
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,806
That's ridiculous.

366
00:13:26,808 --> 00:13:28,274
No, you went up to the control booth,

367
00:13:28,276 --> 00:13:30,476
you scoped out the room,
you repositioned the cameras,

368
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:31,778
and you were able to call the score

369
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,812
a second before it happened.

370
00:13:32,814 --> 00:13:35,081
I observed abnormal behavior patterns,

371
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,582
and I warned my friends.

372
00:13:36,584 --> 00:13:38,985
Well, pardon me if I have
trouble believing that.

373
00:13:38,987 --> 00:13:40,520
Now you're gonna stay here.

374
00:13:40,522 --> 00:13:42,388
I'm gonna get a warrant to search your room.

375
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,890
You know what, you don't need a warrant,

376
00:13:43,892 --> 00:13:45,358
and when you don't find anything,

377
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,027
I expect an apology.

378
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:49,395
All right, let's get to it.

379
00:13:49,397 --> 00:13:50,997
Everything checked, everything.

380
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:53,332
Oh, not the bed. It was so clean.

381
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:56,302
Maybe we should call Cabe.

382
00:13:56,304 --> 00:13:58,371
No, absolutely not. Under no circumstances

383
00:13:58,373 --> 00:14:00,039
- are we calling Cabe.
- Stop being stubborn.

384
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,240
This is serious.

385
00:14:01,242 --> 00:14:02,375
They're not gonna find anything.

386
00:14:02,377 --> 00:14:04,310
We didn't rob anyone, remember?

387
00:14:04,312 --> 00:14:05,711
Detective Rake.

388
00:14:06,697 --> 00:14:09,198
Step away, please.

389
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:11,150
Thank you.

390
00:14:11,152 --> 00:14:15,020
Oh, the serial numbers match
the lot from the cash card.

391
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:16,355
- Whose bag is this?
-  It's mine,

392
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:17,590
but I didn't take that money.

393
00:14:17,592 --> 00:14:18,758
So it just magically appeared

394
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,327
the way those robbers magically disappeared?

395
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:25,598
I have never committed a crime in my life.

396
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,200
- Well, you did hack into NASA. 
- Shut up.

397
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:29,435
Cuff him.

398
00:14:29,437 --> 00:14:30,569
You can't arrest him.

399
00:14:30,571 --> 00:14:32,104
Actually, I can.

400
00:14:32,106 --> 00:14:33,706
Oh,

401
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,874
don't hold your breath for that apology.

402
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,977
You're under arrest, Mr. O'Brien.

403
00:14:37,979 --> 00:14:40,145
Excuse me.

404
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,953
This is ridiculous; I'm calling Cabe.

405
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:49,188
I am your employer.

406
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,489
I'm telling you no.

407
00:14:50,491 --> 00:14:52,524
We're a professional company.

408
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:55,160
We can handle this without calling Cabe.

409
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:56,628
You're in handcuffs.

410
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,398
I have a plan; don't worry.

411
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,300
Mr. O'Brien, I understand you waived

412
00:15:01,302 --> 00:15:02,668
your public defender.

413
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,303
Correct, yes. I-I don't need one

414
00:15:04,305 --> 00:15:06,605
since this court can't
provide me with a fair trial.

415
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:08,573
You see, it's my constitutional right

416
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:09,942
to a jury of my peers.

417
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:11,743
Which means you'd need to find 12 residents

418
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,680
of Clark County, Nevada,
with an IQ of 197 or above,

419
00:15:14,682 --> 00:15:16,181
and I've spent some time in Clark County.

420
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:17,716
I can tell you that's not gonna happen.

421
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:18,917
Not good.

422
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,452
There's no option but to release me.

423
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:21,753
Mm-hmm.

424
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,222
Bail is set at 500,000.

425
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:25,624
Your Honor, on what grounds?

426
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:28,627
I consider your enormous IQ

427
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:30,795
a contributing factor to flight risk.

428
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,063
Next case.

429
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,265
Uh, this is insane.

430
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,066
Your Honor, Your...

431
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:36,768
Toby, go get my bail money.

432
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,303
Toby, win my bail money.

433
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:40,527
Toby, the bet's off. Toby!

434
00:15:40,553 --> 00:15:42,420
Toby, the bet's off!

435
00:15:57,377 --> 00:15:59,745
I'd skip the
black light app in here.

436
00:15:59,771 --> 00:16:01,213
Ignorance is bliss.

437
00:16:01,237 --> 00:16:03,876
Okay, so we've got to figure
out how we're spring Walter.

438
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,500
You heard him; I'm gambling him out.

439
00:16:05,502 --> 00:16:08,470
No, I've seen you after
a two-day crap bender.

440
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:09,672
You get nuts and lose judgment,

441
00:16:09,673 --> 00:16:11,139
and I do not trust you doubling down

442
00:16:11,141 --> 00:16:12,140
on Walter's freedom.

443
00:16:12,142 --> 00:16:13,241
Speaking of which, we only have,

444
00:16:13,243 --> 00:16:14,209
like, two hours

445
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:15,777
until County Clerk Office closes at 5:00.

446
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,078
He'll be held in there all weekend,

447
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,880
and the longer he's in there,

448
00:16:18,882 --> 00:16:20,148
the better the chance the evidence

449
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,849
that could clear him will
be lost or destroyed.

450
00:16:21,851 --> 00:16:23,351
Why is that?

451
00:16:23,353 --> 00:16:25,486
If anyone could find out who framed him,
he can.

452
00:16:25,488 --> 00:16:27,588
Why do you think only Walter can solve this?

453
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,424
I mean, who ruined you?

454
00:16:29,426 --> 00:16:30,658
My dad.

455
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,527
It was rhetorical.

456
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:35,430
If we bail Walter out without
figuring out who set him up,

457
00:16:35,432 --> 00:16:37,765
he's just gonna go to trial
eventually and get convicted.

458
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:39,500
We need to find out who framed him.

459
00:16:39,502 --> 00:16:40,802
Wrong. This is triage.

460
00:16:40,804 --> 00:16:42,870
We need to get him out before anything else.

461
00:16:42,872 --> 00:16:44,272
- I disagree.
- I'm not sure.

462
00:16:44,274 --> 00:16:46,174
- Well, I'm not surprised. 
- Oh, my God, enough!

463
00:16:46,176 --> 00:16:47,975
You guys have been without
Walter ten minutes,

464
00:16:47,977 --> 00:16:49,677
and you're already at each other's throats.

465
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,779
Can you win the money fast enough,
yes or no?

466
00:16:51,781 --> 00:16:54,282
I got 112 bucks. Sylvester?

467
00:16:56,685 --> 00:16:58,753
I have $80, but if I'm counting cards

468
00:16:58,755 --> 00:17:01,455
to avoid detection,
I need to keep my bets small.

469
00:17:01,457 --> 00:17:03,124
It could take all weekend to raise the cash

470
00:17:03,126 --> 00:17:04,458
- that we need. 
- Which is why you

471
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,760
are gonna moneyball the sports book.

472
00:17:05,762 --> 00:17:07,795
Start memorizing players fast.

473
00:17:07,797 --> 00:17:09,029
If you and I can somehow see

474
00:17:09,031 --> 00:17:11,031
the surveillance footage outside our suite,

475
00:17:11,033 --> 00:17:13,334
maybe we'll spot who planted
that money in Walter's bag.

476
00:17:13,336 --> 00:17:15,803
This is ridiculous; I'm completely innocent.

477
00:17:15,805 --> 00:17:18,138
I know. You're the 43rd innocent person

478
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,740
I've booked this week.

479
00:17:19,742 --> 00:17:21,308
And I didn't steal no jewelry.

480
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,409
I'm innocent, too.

481
00:17:22,411 --> 00:17:23,944
Like this guy.

482
00:17:23,946 --> 00:17:25,646
Well, that's not true.

483
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:27,381
The cuts on his knuckles are straight,

484
00:17:27,383 --> 00:17:29,216
probably from smashing a
window or a display case,

485
00:17:29,218 --> 00:17:31,552
but the ones on his fingertips,
they're jagged.

486
00:17:31,554 --> 00:17:33,053
The kind you get from the sharpened edges

487
00:17:33,055 --> 00:17:34,355
of an uncut diamond.

488
00:17:34,357 --> 00:17:37,057
You been picking up precious
stones sometime recently?

489
00:17:40,228 --> 00:17:41,495
- I'll kill you!
- Whoa!

490
00:17:41,497 --> 00:17:42,362
I'll kill you!

491
00:17:42,364 --> 00:17:43,997
Whoa. You're dead!

492
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:45,532
You're dead!

493
00:17:45,534 --> 00:17:46,867
You're dead, smart ass!

494
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:49,536
Well, Mr. Geologist,

495
00:17:49,538 --> 00:17:51,071
if I put you in the gen pop with him,

496
00:17:51,073 --> 00:17:52,139
he'll tear your head off.

497
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:54,174
Looks like you bunking in the drunk tank.

498
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:55,741
That sounds lovely.

499
00:17:55,767 --> 00:17:58,111
All right, ladies,
I was able to pull the film,

500
00:17:58,113 --> 00:18:00,013
but I only did this to make a point.

501
00:18:01,183 --> 00:18:04,051
No one in or out of the
room from the time you left

502
00:18:04,053 --> 00:18:06,119
until we came back to search for it.

503
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:07,521
You said you had a point to make.

504
00:18:07,523 --> 00:18:09,523
Yeah, you're all in on it.

505
00:18:09,525 --> 00:18:11,258
We only found cash in your pal's bag,

506
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,293
and you turn on him, I'll talk to the D.A.,

507
00:18:13,295 --> 00:18:15,195
get you a deal. You don't,

508
00:18:15,197 --> 00:18:16,730
I'm gonna go after each
and every one of you.

509
00:18:16,732 --> 00:18:18,298
Absolutely not.

510
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,300
Look, that window. The angle's

511
00:18:20,302 --> 00:18:22,469
from a different floor
from the floor we were on.

512
00:18:22,471 --> 00:18:25,071
Give me that picture we took for Ralph.

513
00:18:25,073 --> 00:18:26,273
Here.

514
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:30,343
She posed in our suite. Our floor

515
00:18:30,345 --> 00:18:33,013
was perfectly aligned with
the tiger's eyes on the casino

516
00:18:33,015 --> 00:18:35,015
across the street. The angle on this footage

517
00:18:35,017 --> 00:18:36,650
is by its mouth.

518
00:18:36,652 --> 00:18:38,251
This camera was on another floor.

519
00:18:38,253 --> 00:18:40,787
Someone spliced these tapes.

520
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:42,155
I'm gonna have to look into this.

521
00:18:42,157 --> 00:18:43,356
You do that.

522
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:46,793
That was so badass.

523
00:18:46,795 --> 00:18:48,795
Whoever framed Walter is desperate enough

524
00:18:48,797 --> 00:18:50,764
to fudge film and then give it to the cops.

525
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:53,533
The problem is,
Vegas is full of desperate people.

526
00:18:55,503 --> 00:18:57,770
Check it out.

527
00:18:57,772 --> 00:18:59,873
A public hearing announcement
for the Crimson expansion

528
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,174
building permits.

529
00:19:01,176 --> 00:19:03,576
Renee said her dad was
spread real thin financially.

530
00:19:03,578 --> 00:19:05,745
Sounds pretty desperate to me.

531
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:10,783
Hey, are the permit applications

532
00:19:10,785 --> 00:19:13,586
for the Crimson expansion public record?

533
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:15,888
Great. We'd like copies

534
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,690
of everything you have.

535
00:19:20,394 --> 00:19:21,894
Oh, look at Texas over here.

536
00:19:21,896 --> 00:19:23,596
Oh! Seven!

537
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,533
500 on the over.

538
00:19:30,938 --> 00:19:32,872
You're beautiful,
but you don't have an eight.

539
00:19:32,874 --> 00:19:34,574
Well, this is fun!

540
00:19:35,075 --> 00:19:36,509
50 across the board

541
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:38,477
on the nine horse.

542
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:40,799
What's the fourth quarter
spread on the New York game?

543
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:43,449
Got my face with an ace!

544
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,117
Oh, my God!

545
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,386
25... No, 50.

546
00:19:47,388 --> 00:19:49,021
Give me a club so I can beat you with it.

547
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:50,756
Who plays nine-eight suited?

548
00:19:50,758 --> 00:19:53,092
Eight grand on Cuppa Coffee.

549
00:19:53,094 --> 00:19:54,693
Gonna hurt my rotator cuff

550
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,630
from repeating this motion over and over.

551
00:19:57,632 --> 00:19:59,331
Come on, Cuppa Coffee.

552
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,367
Come on, Cuppa Coffee. Come on.

553
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:03,002
Let's go, Cuppa Coffee! Let's go!

554
00:20:03,004 --> 00:20:04,570
Come on, Cuppa Coffee!

555
00:20:04,572 --> 00:20:06,972
Got to the whip!
Go to the whip, Cuppa Coffee!

556
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:09,241
Wire!

557
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:11,810
Okay.

558
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:13,379
Okay.

559
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:15,180
I'm okay.

560
00:20:15,182 --> 00:20:17,149
I'm okay.

561
00:20:18,452 --> 00:20:20,853
Thank you very much.

562
00:20:20,855 --> 00:20:22,554
Ow.

563
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:28,761
Uh, excuse me, excuse me.

564
00:20:28,763 --> 00:20:31,296
Uh, yeah, I think I'd be better
off with the jewel thief.

565
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:32,865
I'll tell the concierge

566
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:34,907
you're unhappy with your accommodation.

567
00:20:39,173 --> 00:20:42,541
Okay, so we've got $250,000,

568
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:43,976
which is half of what we need.

569
00:20:43,978 --> 00:20:45,110
All new games are starting,

570
00:20:45,112 --> 00:20:46,612
and they're gonna be over past 5:00,

571
00:20:46,614 --> 00:20:48,213
which is too late to bail Walter out.

572
00:20:48,215 --> 00:20:50,048
I'm radioactive in the poker room.

573
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,483
No one's gonna go near me now.

574
00:20:51,485 --> 00:20:53,685
I was on fire, man.

575
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:55,654
That's great, but what do we do?

576
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:57,789
We only have 40 minutes left.

577
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:01,760
I can double it at the roulette wheel.

578
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:03,528
Toby, I don't think

579
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,663
that's a good idea.

580
00:21:04,665 --> 00:21:07,766
Toby, you cannot read a roulette wheel.

581
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:09,167
Like hell I can't.

582
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:10,302
Toby!

583
00:21:10,304 --> 00:21:11,836
Hey!

584
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:14,506
I thought you guys were
gambling down the street.

585
00:21:14,508 --> 00:21:16,341
Toby said this place had better odds.

586
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:18,009
Sylvester, we think we found something.

587
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:20,278
We found records that Bob
Connelly's massive expansion

588
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,048
has been held up for
months due to permit issues

589
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,149
until very recently.

590
00:21:24,151 --> 00:21:25,316
You think he paid someone off?

591
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:26,418
This is Vegas.

592
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,453
The payoff was practically invented here.

593
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:30,555
The guy's tight on cash;
his own daughter said so.

594
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:32,590
It's possible the robbery
is really an insurance scam

595
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:34,659
to cover the cost of a permit bribe.

596
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:35,794
Where's Toby?

597
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:38,530
That's a bit of a problem.

598
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,937
What the hell are you doing?

599
00:21:45,939 --> 00:21:47,372
Look at how she holds the ball,

600
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:48,573
so gingerly and lightly.

601
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:49,874
She's a gentle soul.

602
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:51,676
It's fascinating.

603
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:53,177
We'll get the rest of the money another way.

604
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:54,545
She always drops the ball opposite a red.

605
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:56,014
Maybe her first car was red

606
00:21:56,016 --> 00:21:58,116
or her mom always wore red lipstick.

607
00:21:58,118 --> 00:21:59,917
Either way, I got this pegged.

608
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,753
No, you don't. Let's take the money we have

609
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:03,020
and get out of here.

610
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:05,990
Okay, Paige.

611
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:10,995
- I got this.
- No, no, no. No, no. Toby.

612
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,396
Toby, Toby, To...

613
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:13,564
Toby.

614
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:14,932
No.

615
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:16,267
That's it. No more bets.

616
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:18,829
I don't even want to look.

617
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:24,709
Hmm?

618
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,047
- You. 
- Good to see you again, Ronny.

619
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,383
Of all the gin joints,

620
00:22:32,385 --> 00:22:34,952
Einstein has to walk into mine.

621
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:37,834
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- O'Brien.

622
00:22:40,725 --> 00:22:42,893
Lawyer's here to see you.

623
00:22:47,732 --> 00:22:49,200
Thank you.

624
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,268
All right. All right.

625
00:22:58,576 --> 00:23:00,377
You don't have the bail money.

626
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,813
We almost had it.
I thought I could get us there at the wheel.

627
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:04,515
You lost it all on one bet?

628
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:07,584
We're not going to be able to
get you out for the weekend.

629
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,119
Hey, you're the one that sent me in there.

630
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,487
You had to show off, right?

631
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:11,755
Win too much too fast,

632
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:14,525
probably got iced out in the poker room.

633
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:17,628
The one time I need you to
come through for me, Toby.

634
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,296
We almost had it.

635
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:22,266
I could feel that we almost had it.

636
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:24,601
I've heard your pathetic
gambling war stories for...

637
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,403
This wasn't intentional, Walter.

638
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,405
We have a legitimate company, Toby.

639
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,040
A chance to grow something.

640
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,241
A chance to show...

641
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,876
Show who? Hmm?

642
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:35,145
Show who? Cabe?

643
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,414
Your father figure that you've just been

644
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,983
shaking your ass for since
he wandered into the garage.

645
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,752
“Oh, look at me, Dad.

646
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,754
“I'm on the high dive. Look at me, Pop.

647
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,622
I can run my own company.”

648
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:47,624
Save your psychoanalysis for your patients.

649
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,192
How many times

650
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,927
have I literally and figuratively

651
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,562
had to bail you out?

652
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,264
I'm not the one who got you into this mess.

653
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,366
I'm the one who had to dig
through a Salvation Army bin

654
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,268
so I could pass as a lawyer and talk to you.

655
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,503
To tell me what? That you messed up again?

656
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:02,038
You're just always right.

657
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,808
And you love telling
everybody that you're right,

658
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,609
reminding people that you're right,

659
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,945
showing everyone, “Hey, hey, I'm right.”

660
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,613
No.

661
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,981
I'm not always right.

662
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,716
I thought I could count on you.

663
00:24:14,652 --> 00:24:16,820
I sure wasn't right about that.

664
00:24:28,941 --> 00:24:31,209
Sylvester, where are we now?

665
00:24:31,211 --> 00:24:35,313
The potentialities of
exonerating Walter are terrible.

666
00:24:36,248 --> 00:24:37,916
Really?

667
00:24:37,918 --> 00:24:39,951
There's a lot of negative
vibes in this room right now.

668
00:24:39,953 --> 00:24:41,086
I think a beer might help.

669
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:42,420
What would have helped was you

670
00:24:42,422 --> 00:24:43,888
not gambling away the bail money.

671
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:44,989
You know, everyone's acting

672
00:24:44,991 --> 00:24:47,125
like we were applying for a bank loan.

673
00:24:47,127 --> 00:24:49,527
We were gambling. There's risk involved.

674
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,962
No, we're not going through with this again.

675
00:24:50,964 --> 00:24:52,130
We've already let Walter down once.

676
00:24:52,132 --> 00:24:54,692
A second time isn't an option.

677
00:24:55,134 --> 00:24:57,101
Yes.

678
00:24:57,103 --> 00:24:59,203
Are you our new Walter?

679
00:24:59,205 --> 00:25:01,673
You brainiacs can't agree on anything,
so I'm stepping up.

680
00:25:01,675 --> 00:25:03,174
Okay.

681
00:25:03,176 --> 00:25:04,776
What's our plan, boss?

682
00:25:04,778 --> 00:25:06,310
Okay.

683
00:25:06,312 --> 00:25:09,280
Bob Connelly was overextended,
so it's possible either he

684
00:25:09,282 --> 00:25:10,882
or someone working for him

685
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,051
put the money in... in his bag.

686
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,920
If we can prove he was in the red,

687
00:25:15,922 --> 00:25:20,185
it might establish motive to frame Walter.

688
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:22,975
That is an interesting theory,
but we can't hack

689
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:24,233
into Connelly's financial records

690
00:25:24,235 --> 00:25:26,979
because Walter just had to go
and install his security overlay.

691
00:25:27,005 --> 00:25:29,072
You can't hack your own software?

692
00:25:29,074 --> 00:25:30,406
Uh-uh.
- No, it's Walter software.

693
00:25:30,408 --> 00:25:31,874
We could follow the steps,

694
00:25:31,876 --> 00:25:33,976
but it's millions of lines of code.

695
00:25:33,978 --> 00:25:36,312
- Okay.
- There is another way.

696
00:25:36,314 --> 00:25:38,129
I might be able to sniff
into their network.

697
00:25:38,155 --> 00:25:40,349
We would have to attach a
remote-frequency jump drive

698
00:25:40,351 --> 00:25:41,812
with a VPN to Connelly's computer

699
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:44,132
and one to my laptop,
and then they could speak to each other.

700
00:25:44,134 --> 00:25:45,134
They could transfer data.

701
00:25:45,135 --> 00:25:46,468
The Crimson thinks

702
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,903
we just robbed them of $10 million.

703
00:25:48,905 --> 00:25:51,321
Can't just walk in through the front door.

704
00:25:51,347 --> 00:25:53,314
Then we won't use the front door.

705
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,711
You cost me my job.

706
00:25:56,713 --> 00:25:58,613
I now regret that decision.

707
00:25:58,615 --> 00:25:59,781
I hit the scotch.

708
00:25:59,783 --> 00:26:02,083
I got busted for public intoxication.

709
00:26:02,085 --> 00:26:03,451
To be fair, that part is your fault.

710
00:26:03,453 --> 00:26:06,821
Let's see how my small
hands look around your neck.

711
00:26:06,823 --> 00:26:08,690
Apologies in advance.

712
00:26:11,226 --> 00:26:13,127
I'm feeling sick.

713
00:26:13,129 --> 00:26:15,330
I'm pulling your focus with my fingers.

714
00:26:15,332 --> 00:26:16,664
Foreground/background optical adjustment's

715
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:19,067
affected greatly when intoxicated.

716
00:26:20,536 --> 00:26:24,005
Thus causing the onset of spins.

717
00:26:24,007 --> 00:26:26,707
I'm gonna barf.

718
00:26:31,314 --> 00:26:34,482
Just take long, deep breaths.

719
00:26:41,658 --> 00:26:43,591
I know you hate me, Ronny.

720
00:26:43,593 --> 00:26:46,494
But you're gonna have to
keep your hands off my neck.

721
00:26:46,496 --> 00:26:48,562
I can evaluate your skills,

722
00:26:48,564 --> 00:26:50,698
help to set you on a better career path.

723
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,837
Okay. Oh, no, no, no, no.

724
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:58,439
Oh, God.

725
00:27:07,649 --> 00:27:09,783
- Oh, gosh.
- That's hundreds of feet down.

726
00:27:09,785 --> 00:27:10,818
Hey, project manager,

727
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,052
don't lose the receipt.

728
00:27:12,054 --> 00:27:15,389
I doubt I'll ever have
use for a crossbow again.

729
00:27:15,391 --> 00:27:16,924
I don't want to sound like Sylvester,

730
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,525
but I'm terrified.

731
00:27:18,527 --> 00:27:20,728
Like you said,
we can't go through the front door.

732
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,963
Won't exterior cameras see us?

733
00:27:22,965 --> 00:27:25,366
I calculated a 12-degree-angle blind spot.

734
00:27:25,368 --> 00:27:27,668
So don't swing your legs too much, skinny.

735
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:29,937
I don't see a harness in that duffel bag.

736
00:27:30,772 --> 00:27:32,573
Earbuds in.

737
00:27:35,743 --> 00:27:37,678
You're not terrified right now?

738
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,813
I did the calculations. No problem.

739
00:27:39,815 --> 00:27:41,481
Oh, gosh.

740
00:27:43,418 --> 00:27:46,119
Hey, when I grow up, I want to be you.
Good luck.

741
00:27:46,121 --> 00:27:47,454
Luck doesn't exist.

742
00:27:47,456 --> 00:27:49,323
Math and science does.

743
00:27:59,834 --> 00:28:02,903
Paige, just keep Sylvester in the loop.

744
00:28:02,905 --> 00:28:05,672
Sylvester, we're a go on the roof.

745
00:28:05,674 --> 00:28:08,508
Copy that. Be careful.

746
00:28:10,611 --> 00:28:12,312
Ah. Okay.

747
00:28:27,895 --> 00:28:30,030
- Oh, my gosh. 
- Hey, that's...

748
00:28:30,032 --> 00:28:32,198
- that's good. That's really... 
- Good job.

749
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,199
Come on.

750
00:28:33,201 --> 00:28:34,401
Let's go. I'll go.

751
00:28:34,403 --> 00:28:36,002
Okay.

752
00:28:36,004 --> 00:28:37,337
I can help you.

753
00:28:38,572 --> 00:28:40,440
You're all right.

754
00:28:40,442 --> 00:28:41,574
You're okay. Don't look.

755
00:28:41,576 --> 00:28:42,609
Okay. Oh.

756
00:28:42,611 --> 00:28:44,110
I really don't want to die

757
00:28:44,112 --> 00:28:45,312
in the middle of a dry spell.

758
00:28:45,313 --> 00:28:47,280
It was just one bad run at roulette.

759
00:28:47,282 --> 00:28:48,381
You're gonna be okay.

760
00:28:48,383 --> 00:28:49,482
I'm not talking about gambling.

761
00:28:49,484 --> 00:28:52,185
- Ew. 
- Okay!

762
00:28:52,187 --> 00:28:53,720
I'm gonna go now.

763
00:29:02,996 --> 00:29:05,698
Toby! Don't swing your legs.

764
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,733
Oh... Oh, no.

765
00:29:10,971 --> 00:29:13,039
I got it.

766
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:14,540
Oh, my liver.

767
00:29:14,542 --> 00:29:16,209
My bad. I calibrated the line

768
00:29:16,211 --> 00:29:17,810
for my weight.

769
00:29:17,812 --> 00:29:19,712
Come on.

770
00:29:24,885 --> 00:29:27,219
Ladies first.

771
00:29:30,684 --> 00:29:32,484
I've been baking all my life.

772
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,360
I... I never thought I
could make money at it.

773
00:29:34,362 --> 00:29:35,795
Well, follow the distribution

774
00:29:35,797 --> 00:29:37,329
and marketing schedule I gave you,

775
00:29:37,331 --> 00:29:38,931
and your scones will be everywhere.

776
00:29:39,184 --> 00:29:41,188
What's a guy like you doing in here?

777
00:29:41,214 --> 00:29:43,948
A casino was robbed.
I was framed. In a nutshell.

778
00:29:44,404 --> 00:29:46,172
I'm in real trouble, Ronny.

779
00:29:46,174 --> 00:29:48,374
Vegas will do that to you.

780
00:29:48,376 --> 00:29:52,978
Sad thing... this is the second
time my hands cost me a job.

781
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,247
I came out here to be a magician.

782
00:29:55,249 --> 00:29:57,783
But all the great masters
all had long fingers

783
00:29:57,785 --> 00:29:59,685
so they could manipulate the cards better.

784
00:29:59,687 --> 00:30:02,247
I could never get to the next level.

785
00:30:02,522 --> 00:30:04,223
I loved magic.

786
00:30:04,225 --> 00:30:07,693
There's this one guy, Great Scott.

787
00:30:07,695 --> 00:30:09,695
He used to play the Crimson

788
00:30:09,697 --> 00:30:12,598
back when it was the, uh, Oasis Queen.

789
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,500
He used to disappear from the stage

790
00:30:14,502 --> 00:30:16,268
and reappear on Las Vegas Boulevard.

791
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,904
Blew my mind.

792
00:30:21,107 --> 00:30:22,808
That's it.

793
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,376
That's it.

794
00:30:24,378 --> 00:30:27,412
When Great Scott did his show,

795
00:30:27,414 --> 00:30:29,481
where was his stage?

796
00:30:29,483 --> 00:30:32,050
Well, the Crimson was 
remodeled 30 years ago.

797
00:30:32,052 --> 00:30:33,719
That's before Connelly bought it.

798
00:30:33,721 --> 00:30:35,420
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure that the stage

799
00:30:35,422 --> 00:30:37,823
was in the northwest corner of the casino.

800
00:30:37,825 --> 00:30:39,624
They got a big storage room there now.

801
00:30:39,626 --> 00:30:40,892
Ooh, that's how they got out.

802
00:30:40,894 --> 00:30:43,395
I need to get this information to my team.

803
00:30:43,397 --> 00:30:47,432
Sorry to tell you, but you're locked up.

804
00:30:47,434 --> 00:30:48,500
Not for long.

805
00:30:48,502 --> 00:30:49,701
That rayon shirt, it's highly flammable.

806
00:30:49,703 --> 00:30:51,036
Uh, can you tear off the sleeve?

807
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:52,904
- My aunt gave this to me.
- Tear off the sleeve, please.

808
00:30:52,906 --> 00:30:54,439
You're not gonna get in any trouble.
Come on.

809
00:30:56,877 --> 00:30:58,410
Come on. Come on.

810
00:30:58,412 --> 00:31:00,045
Come on, come on, give me...

811
00:31:01,548 --> 00:31:03,748
Okay...

812
00:31:05,618 --> 00:31:07,538
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

813
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,255
What are you doing?

814
00:31:10,257 --> 00:31:12,524
It has chlorine in it.

815
00:31:13,526 --> 00:31:16,428
Your pants...
they got a metal button on them?

816
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,896
- Yeah. 
- Yeah.

817
00:31:17,898 --> 00:31:21,032
I know we're in jail,
but I'm not taking my pants off.

818
00:31:21,034 --> 00:31:23,334
No, I need the metal button.
I need to rub metal on metal.

819
00:31:23,336 --> 00:31:24,636
Create friction. Come on.

820
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:26,738
All right.

821
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,300
Come on, come on, come on.

822
00:31:30,743 --> 00:31:32,644
All right. Wait.

823
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:39,817
Don't breathe in the chlorine fumes.

824
00:31:40,586 --> 00:31:42,587
What are you doing?

825
00:31:42,589 --> 00:31:44,989
The fumes will warp the pins in the tumbler.

826
00:31:44,991 --> 00:31:46,524
Just listen.

827
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:56,400
Just say you were sleeping the whole time.

828
00:31:56,402 --> 00:31:58,703
Hey. I owe you one, Ronny.

829
00:31:59,805 --> 00:32:02,640
New theory about why
you insisted I go first,

830
00:32:02,642 --> 00:32:04,375
and it involves you being a perv.

831
00:32:04,377 --> 00:32:05,610
Oh, would you, please?

832
00:32:05,612 --> 00:32:06,844
I'm a doctor.

833
00:32:06,846 --> 00:32:09,614
All gluteus maximi look the same to me.

834
00:32:09,616 --> 00:32:11,816
I mean, that said, I've had worse views.

835
00:32:20,692 --> 00:32:22,560
My kidney.

836
00:32:22,562 --> 00:32:24,261
Hurry.
Security is inside.

837
00:32:24,263 --> 00:32:26,497
- They might be on to us. 
- Security's coming.

838
00:32:27,332 --> 00:32:28,566
Happy, go. I'll...

839
00:32:28,568 --> 00:32:30,849
- I'll distract them.
- Over here!

840
00:32:33,071 --> 00:32:34,238
He's over here.

841
00:32:50,755 --> 00:32:52,723
Sylvester, the jump drive's in.

842
00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:54,291
You can initiate the download.

843
00:32:55,461 --> 00:32:57,561
Checking the signal.

844
00:32:57,563 --> 00:32:59,329
And I'm in. I'm in.

845
00:32:59,331 --> 00:33:01,665
Okay. The computers are
talking to each other,

846
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:04,201
and we are getting the
files from the casino.

847
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,407
You're parked in a loading zone.

848
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:12,109
Move it unless you want to get towed.

849
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:14,578
Oh. Oh, uh...

850
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,879
Um, I don't drive.

851
00:33:15,881 --> 00:33:16,880
Right.

852
00:33:16,882 --> 00:33:18,949
Move the car now.

853
00:33:20,885 --> 00:33:22,819
Sylvester?

854
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:24,621
The drive's showing that the
transfer has been interrupted.

855
00:33:24,623 --> 00:33:26,089
What's going on?

856
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:28,158
A mean lady made me move my car!

857
00:33:48,412 --> 00:33:50,447
Oh.

858
00:33:50,449 --> 00:33:52,716
Well, hi.

859
00:33:53,752 --> 00:33:56,086
How you guys doing?

860
00:34:00,324 --> 00:34:02,092
Talk to me, Sylvester.

861
00:34:02,094 --> 00:34:04,027
I'm almost back in front of the hotel!

862
00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:07,397
It's the pedal on the right, Grandma.

863
00:34:08,834 --> 00:34:09,966
I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Okay.

864
00:34:09,968 --> 00:34:12,001
Whoa. Sylvester?

865
00:34:12,003 --> 00:34:13,303
Walter, you're out?

866
00:34:13,305 --> 00:34:14,437
- Sylvester, you're driving?
- Yeah, I have to

867
00:34:14,439 --> 00:34:16,005
get to the hotel for the wireless signal.

868
00:34:16,007 --> 00:34:17,073
Okay, move over, move over.

869
00:34:17,075 --> 00:34:19,709
Come on. No, seat belt, seat belt.

870
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:22,779
All right, all right.

871
00:34:24,148 --> 00:34:25,782
Okay, it went through.

872
00:34:25,784 --> 00:34:27,817
Good job.

873
00:34:27,819 --> 00:34:30,186
Thanks, Happy.

874
00:34:30,188 --> 00:34:31,521
Walter?

875
00:34:31,523 --> 00:34:33,790
What the hell are you doing out of jail?

876
00:34:33,792 --> 00:34:35,558
What are you doing in the Crimson?

877
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,959
I'm trying to clear your name.

878
00:34:36,961 --> 00:34:39,495
Except now that Toby's gone,
looks like I'm gonna be

879
00:34:39,497 --> 00:34:42,598
in jail soon enough,
'cause I've got no one to pull me out.

880
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,001
Okay, I can hear voices outside the door.

881
00:34:45,003 --> 00:34:46,903
I'm cooked.

882
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:53,175
You almost took a bullet for me;

883
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:54,944
figured I could take a zip-line for you.

884
00:34:54,946 --> 00:34:57,213
Let's go.

885
00:35:00,584 --> 00:35:02,184
Oh...

886
00:35:02,186 --> 00:35:03,352
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay, okay.

887
00:35:03,354 --> 00:35:04,587
All right, all right, all right.

888
00:35:04,589 --> 00:35:06,355
Easy!

889
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:09,658
Hey! There they are!

890
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,393
Come on, come on, come on! Guys, come on!

891
00:35:11,395 --> 00:35:13,262
Quick, quick, get in!
Get in, get in, get in.

892
00:35:13,264 --> 00:35:14,363
Okay, let's go. Go, go, go!

893
00:35:14,365 --> 00:35:17,366
Walter, how did you get out?

894
00:35:17,368 --> 00:35:19,768
Ronny. You were right,
he wasn't such a bad guy.

895
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,937
Call Toby, we can go pick him up.

896
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:25,007
No.

897
00:35:25,009 --> 00:35:27,176
For all we know,
he's hiding in a broom closet.

898
00:35:27,178 --> 00:35:29,445
His phone rings,
we can give away his location.

899
00:35:29,447 --> 00:35:30,746
Toby's a street rat;

900
00:35:30,748 --> 00:35:32,381
he'll track us down.

901
00:35:32,383 --> 00:35:34,083
He'll be okay.

902
00:35:38,421 --> 00:35:40,522
What's he doing here?

903
00:35:40,524 --> 00:35:42,024
Yeah, caught him sneaking
through the ventilation shaft.

904
00:35:42,026 --> 00:35:43,425
I'm just trying to help my friend.

905
00:35:43,427 --> 00:35:44,626
Yeah, tell that to the cops.

906
00:35:44,628 --> 00:35:45,928
No, no, no, no, no, no.

907
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:48,030
I've had enough bad P.R.
with the armed robbery today.

908
00:35:48,032 --> 00:35:49,665
Last thing we need is the press picking up

909
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:51,099
some guys crawling through our vents.

910
00:35:51,101 --> 00:35:52,467
You're gonna let me go?

911
00:35:52,469 --> 00:35:54,803
I'm gonna have you
dropped off in the desert,

912
00:35:54,805 --> 00:35:56,405
and you can walk back to L.A.

913
00:35:56,407 --> 00:35:57,573
That sounds good.

914
00:35:57,575 --> 00:35:59,408
I'm not really dressed for that, but that...

915
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,410
Okay. All right.

916
00:36:01,412 --> 00:36:04,680
All right, based on what I heard in jail,
the odds are

917
00:36:04,682 --> 00:36:08,150
there is an inside man who
knew about the secret tunnel.

918
00:36:08,152 --> 00:36:10,852
All of Connelly's accounts
are financially stable.

919
00:36:10,854 --> 00:36:12,554
Even if he did have to pay someone off,

920
00:36:12,556 --> 00:36:14,322
he would've been able
to get a bridge loan...

921
00:36:14,324 --> 00:36:15,657
easier than faking a robbery.

922
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:18,860
Sylvester,
pull up the blueprints for the casino.

923
00:36:18,862 --> 00:36:21,329
There's a service entrance
they would have used

924
00:36:21,331 --> 00:36:23,164
to exit that tunnel to their getaway car.

925
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:25,567
An employee key card's
needed to open that door.

926
00:36:25,569 --> 00:36:27,869
So the person that swiped their
card to prop open the door

927
00:36:27,871 --> 00:36:29,337
before the robbery is the inside man.

928
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:30,939
We have all the casino's files.

929
00:36:30,941 --> 00:36:34,442
I-I can just pull up a
log of all the swipes.

930
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,115
<i>When this is,</i>

931
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:42,917
uh, all over,
and the real robbers are caught,

932
00:36:42,919 --> 00:36:45,153
you are gonna feel bad.

933
00:36:45,155 --> 00:36:46,988
Mm, mm, mm.

934
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:49,157
That's not gonna happen.

935
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:52,093
Don't be so sure;
guilt can be a powerful emotion.

936
00:36:53,662 --> 00:36:55,430
Hold on a minute, what's not gonna happen?

937
00:36:55,432 --> 00:36:58,199
You're not gonna feel bad or the
real robbers won't be caught?

938
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,638
You know, Renee,
we're pretty far out right now.

939
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,275
I think a seven-hour walk will
teach me my lesson just fine.

940
00:37:11,213 --> 00:37:13,381
So you're a genius?

941
00:37:13,383 --> 00:37:15,750
Right now, I'm not feeling like one.

942
00:37:31,423 --> 00:37:34,129
Renee, I'm not really understanding
why you would steal from your own casino.

943
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:36,567
You don't know anything about me,
or why I did this.

944
00:37:36,569 --> 00:37:37,735
I don't?

945
00:37:37,737 --> 00:37:39,837
You started working for
your dad when you were 15;

946
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,365
woman trying to prove herself
in a misogynistic business.

947
00:37:42,391 --> 00:37:44,793
Grew up in that place
assuming that one day...

948
00:37:44,819 --> 00:37:46,952
Ah! Right there.

949
00:37:46,978 --> 00:37:49,245
It's a subliminal desire
to distance yourself.

950
00:37:49,265 --> 00:37:52,900
I hit a nerve right when I said
you “Grew up in that place.”

951
00:37:52,902 --> 00:37:53,934
Hmm.

952
00:37:53,936 --> 00:37:55,536
That's maybe because

953
00:37:55,538 --> 00:37:57,972
it's no longer the place you knew?

954
00:37:57,974 --> 00:38:00,708
Because your dad...

955
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,276
is expanding, hmm?

956
00:38:02,278 --> 00:38:05,112
And he's not including
you in that expansion.

957
00:38:05,114 --> 00:38:09,884
I have dedicated my life
to his casino... to him...

958
00:38:09,886 --> 00:38:12,553
and he's giving control to
the new venue to some...

959
00:38:12,555 --> 00:38:14,154
some guy on the board of directors?

960
00:38:14,156 --> 00:38:16,957
Wow, I was right on the money there.

961
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:20,627
My partners and I are gonna take
the $10 million that I deserve

962
00:38:20,629 --> 00:38:22,596
and build our own venue...

963
00:38:22,598 --> 00:38:24,665
better shows, better events...

964
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:27,234
and we're gonna drive the
Crimson into the ground.

965
00:38:27,236 --> 00:38:28,435
And you...

966
00:38:29,537 --> 00:38:31,872
you're gonna send a text.

967
00:38:36,979 --> 00:38:39,179
It's a text from Toby.

968
00:38:39,181 --> 00:38:40,914
“Security just dropped
me off in the desert.

969
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:45,118
“I need you to pick me up at 115 longitude,
35 degrees latitude...

970
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,588
directly under Orion's Belt.”

971
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:09,409
I told you, you and casinos don't mix.

972
00:39:11,078 --> 00:39:12,746
Get out the car now!

973
00:39:19,287 --> 00:39:21,454
Time to do some digging.

974
00:39:34,802 --> 00:39:36,770
Hold on. He's supposed to be locked up.

975
00:39:36,772 --> 00:39:39,132
There's something wrong.
There's something's wrong here!

976
00:39:47,048 --> 00:39:49,215
On your knees! Down now!

977
00:39:51,953 --> 00:39:53,119
On your knees!

978
00:39:53,121 --> 00:39:54,854
Get on your knees!

979
00:39:57,157 --> 00:39:59,325
Get on your knees!

980
00:40:03,063 --> 00:40:06,199
Told you guys you weren't
ready to go out on your own.

981
00:40:06,201 --> 00:40:09,102
How the hell did you know I was in trouble?

982
00:40:09,104 --> 00:40:10,603
Walter called.

983
00:40:10,605 --> 00:40:11,904
Said you texted about meeting

984
00:40:11,906 --> 00:40:13,339
underneath Orion's Belt

985
00:40:13,341 --> 00:40:15,708
because it isn't visible
this time of the year.

986
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:18,211
Walter figured it out?

987
00:40:23,248 --> 00:40:25,450
All right, turns out Renee's
been laundering money

988
00:40:25,476 --> 00:40:28,009
for the Jotas for years through the casino.

989
00:40:28,222 --> 00:40:30,990
She's the one that had
access to the security film.

990
00:40:30,992 --> 00:40:33,826
Remember when you wouldn't
apologize to Walter?

991
00:40:35,228 --> 00:40:38,030
I'm sorry.

992
00:40:40,767 --> 00:40:44,503
For the record, you were a great Walter.

993
00:40:44,505 --> 00:40:47,806
So, uh, you're not gonna 
say “I told you so”?

994
00:40:47,808 --> 00:40:50,276
Didn't say that, jailbird.

995
00:40:50,278 --> 00:40:51,677
Speaking of jail, I am gonna need you

996
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:53,679
to make a call to get one of my friends out.

997
00:40:53,681 --> 00:40:55,648
A friend in jail?

998
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:56,782
Long story.

999
00:40:56,784 --> 00:40:58,784
I'm gonna give him a cut of my pay,

1000
00:40:58,786 --> 00:41:00,019
for a business he's starting.

1001
00:41:00,021 --> 00:41:01,887
Any thoughts on how we're getting home?

1002
00:41:01,889 --> 00:41:03,522
I'd prefer it if we didn't fly.

1003
00:41:03,524 --> 00:41:05,658
Fine. Get in.

1004
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:09,294
I am glad that my criminal informant

1005
00:41:09,296 --> 00:41:10,763
managed to break this case open.

1006
00:41:10,765 --> 00:41:11,830
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1007
00:41:11,832 --> 00:41:13,232
Your informant?

1008
00:41:13,234 --> 00:41:16,368
I was the sacrificial
lamb that made it possible

1009
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:18,036
for Happy to get Connelly's computer,

1010
00:41:18,038 --> 00:41:19,872
not to mention save everyone's life.

1011
00:41:19,874 --> 00:41:21,206
Where are you going?

1012
00:41:21,208 --> 00:41:22,608
Home.

1013
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:25,277
Well, I'm not riding five hours
listening to you kids argue.

1014
00:41:25,279 --> 00:41:26,879
We're in the middle of the desert.

1015
00:41:26,881 --> 00:41:29,248
There's a bus depot four miles west.

1016
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,216
Suggest you start walking.

1017
00:41:31,218 --> 00:41:33,518
We barely have any money.

1018
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,022
Then I suggest you take
on another private client.

1019
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,394
That's a joke, right?

1020
00:41:42,396 --> 00:41:44,096
Really? Okay.

1021
00:41:46,933 --> 00:41:48,867
A woman hires us

1022
00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:50,902
'cause she wants to prove
something to her dad.

1023
00:41:50,904 --> 00:41:53,405
We take the job
'cause you want to prove something to Cabe.

1024
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,573
And I almost blow the job

1025
00:41:54,575 --> 00:41:56,908
'cause I want to prove something to you.

1026
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,944
Prove what?

1027
00:42:02,449 --> 00:42:04,149
You want to know what the worst thing

1028
00:42:04,151 --> 00:42:06,584
about what you said to me in that jail was?

1029
00:42:06,586 --> 00:42:08,019
- Mm-hmm. 
- You were right.

1030
00:42:08,021 --> 00:42:09,521
Come on. No.

1031
00:42:09,523 --> 00:42:11,790
We're both too smart to pretend otherwise.

1032
00:42:12,892 --> 00:42:14,492
I've been a screwup my entire life.

1033
00:42:14,494 --> 00:42:17,228
Bookies and loan sharks...
you've pulled my fat out of the fire

1034
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,596
more times than a fry cook.

1035
00:42:18,598 --> 00:42:20,331
You have your weaknesses and strengths,

1036
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:21,833
but you're an asset to the team.

1037
00:42:21,835 --> 00:42:23,768
Yeah,
I'm not talking about being an employee.

1038
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:25,270
I'm talking about being a friend.

1039
00:42:25,272 --> 00:42:26,471
All I ever wanted to do

1040
00:42:26,473 --> 00:42:28,072
was show you I was worth your effort,

1041
00:42:28,074 --> 00:42:30,375
that I could... that I could be counted on

1042
00:42:30,377 --> 00:42:32,744
the way I count on you, and I can't do that.

1043
00:42:32,746 --> 00:42:35,179
You zip-lined down a hundred-
foot drop to help me tonight.

1044
00:42:35,181 --> 00:42:37,248
That's a better friend
than most people ever have.

1045
00:42:37,492 --> 00:42:39,939
You know what? You were right.

1046
00:42:41,222 --> 00:42:44,288
When Cabe found me, I was a kid.

1047
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:48,259
He'd send me computers, codes to decrypt.

1048
00:42:48,261 --> 00:42:50,661
I never really connected with my dad.

1049
00:42:50,663 --> 00:42:52,964
And Cabe filled a void.

1050
00:42:52,966 --> 00:42:55,600
So when he said I couldn't do something,

1051
00:42:55,602 --> 00:42:58,135
it bothered me.

1052
00:42:58,137 --> 00:43:00,471
More than I realized.

1053
00:43:00,473 --> 00:43:04,609
Well, I think we're out 
of time for this session.

1054
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:10,381
I have an idea. How much money have you got?

1055
00:43:10,383 --> 00:43:12,583
12 bucks. Why?

1056
00:43:14,353 --> 00:43:16,253
You give me an hour at the tables,

1057
00:43:16,255 --> 00:43:17,521
I'll have first-class airfare.

1058
00:43:17,523 --> 00:43:19,824
Let's do it.

1059
00:43:19,826 --> 00:43:23,794
I met some showgirls in an elevator tonight.

1060
00:43:23,796 --> 00:43:25,029
Focus.

1061
00:43:25,031 --> 00:43:26,630
I'm just saying.
