1
00:00:04,407 --> 00:00:06,536
<i>My name is Walter O'Brien.</i>

2
00:00:06,537 --> 00:00:10,873
<i>I have the fourth highest IQ</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

3
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:12,641
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

4
00:00:12,643 --> 00:00:15,244
<i>When I was 11, the FBI</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking NASA</i>

5
00:00:15,246 --> 00:00:17,947
<i>to get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

6
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:20,049
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

7
00:00:20,051 --> 00:00:23,085
<i>tackling worldwide threats</i>
<i>only we can solve.</i>

8
00:00:23,087 --> 00:00:24,853
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

9
00:00:24,855 --> 00:00:26,622
<i>Sylvester's a human calculator.</i>

10
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,924
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

11
00:00:28,926 --> 00:00:31,226
<i>Agent Cabe Gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

12
00:00:31,228 --> 00:00:33,429
<i>And Paige?</i>
<i>Well, Paige isn't like us.</i>

13
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:35,965
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

14
00:00:35,967 --> 00:00:38,534
<i>while we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

15
00:00:38,536 --> 00:00:40,669
<i>Together, we are Scorpion.</i>

16
00:00:45,443 --> 00:00:47,977
The tranquil landscapes
often praised here in Belarus

17
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:51,180
may soon give way to rolling
tanks and blasting mortars

18
00:00:51,182 --> 00:00:54,049
as the century-long
border conflict with neighbors

19
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:57,119
<i>Lithuania and Latvia</i>
<i>has reignited.</i>

20
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:59,455
With each nation being pledged
military support

21
00:00:59,457 --> 00:01:04,126
by respective allies,
Russia, China, Poland, Germany,

22
00:01:04,128 --> 00:01:07,196
and the U.S.,
geopolitical experts fear

23
00:01:07,198 --> 00:01:09,465
if a resolution
is not reached quickly,

24
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:12,534
all these countries
may soon be at war.

25
00:01:12,536 --> 00:01:13,502
Flight 5-19,

26
00:01:13,504 --> 00:01:16,105
LAX runway Bravo is clear.

27
00:01:16,107 --> 00:01:18,507
Wind's one niner niner at two.

28
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,143
Permission to land.

29
00:01:24,548 --> 00:01:26,181
Got an unregistered bogey, sir.

30
00:01:27,284 --> 00:01:30,419
It's only 500 feet
below a 747 heading eastbound.

31
00:01:31,856 --> 00:01:33,555
Establish contact immediately.

32
00:01:33,557 --> 00:01:35,324
The hell?

33
00:01:35,326 --> 00:01:36,825
It just... vanished.

34
00:01:36,827 --> 00:01:38,594
<i>I'm pretty sure</i>

35
00:01:38,596 --> 00:01:40,329
I just committed
at least three felonies.

36
00:01:40,331 --> 00:01:41,730
And I've seen<i> Shawshank.</i>

37
00:01:41,732 --> 00:01:44,667
I know what they do to guys
like me in the big house.

38
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:46,101
D Block prom queen.

39
00:01:46,103 --> 00:01:47,936
That's it? It's gone?
It's still there.

40
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:49,304
I hacked the icon
and changed its color

41
00:01:49,306 --> 00:01:51,507
so it blends in with the
background of the ATC monitor.

42
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,741
Basically,
I made it disappear.

43
00:01:52,743 --> 00:01:54,076
<i>Sudie.</i>

44
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:55,911
That's Lithuanian for
“sayonara,” which is Japanese

45
00:01:55,913 --> 00:01:57,379
for “good-bye.”

46
00:01:57,381 --> 00:01:58,981
That plane will be
effectively invisible

47
00:01:58,983 --> 00:02:00,449
when it lands
at your private airstrip.

48
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:02,551
I am still feeling
very uncomfortable with this.

49
00:02:02,553 --> 00:02:03,585
It's deceptive.

50
00:02:03,587 --> 00:02:05,220
Tensions are extremely high.

51
00:02:05,222 --> 00:02:07,423
If the world knew that the
leaders from Belarus, Lithuania,

52
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:09,625
and Latvia were flying
to the U.S.

53
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:12,161
and no treaty was reached,
it could tip the entire region

54
00:02:12,163 --> 00:02:13,996
over the edge.
I understand.

55
00:02:13,998 --> 00:02:16,065
But historically, when
governments try to hide facts

56
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:19,134
from citizenry,
everyone winds up in hot water.

57
00:02:37,354 --> 00:02:38,554
Oh.

58
00:02:38,556 --> 00:02:41,090
You're still playing
with your toy?

59
00:02:41,092 --> 00:02:44,359
This toy is three-dimensional

60
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:46,462
viz-surround
software technology.

61
00:02:46,464 --> 00:02:47,663
Oh, it's-it's green screen.

62
00:02:47,665 --> 00:02:48,897
It's been used
in Hollywood forever.

63
00:02:48,899 --> 00:02:51,433
Wrong. It can be used
on a green screen,

64
00:02:51,435 --> 00:02:54,369
but my software allows you
to take various images

65
00:02:54,371 --> 00:02:57,639
from different sources
and layer them seamlessly

66
00:02:57,641 --> 00:02:59,274
on top of each other.

67
00:02:59,276 --> 00:03:00,743
Like Colorforms.

68
00:03:00,745 --> 00:03:02,010
The kids' toy.

69
00:03:02,012 --> 00:03:04,379
I didn't play with
kids' toys. Anyway,

70
00:03:04,381 --> 00:03:05,848
even FBI video forensics

71
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,217
couldn't detect these images
as fake.

72
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:10,285
They're groundbreaking.
Good. Because

73
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:11,754
you're gonna need to fool a lot
of people today.

74
00:03:11,756 --> 00:03:13,589
Oh, it will.
So, speaking of today,

75
00:03:13,591 --> 00:03:14,890
did you see my analysis report?

76
00:03:14,892 --> 00:03:16,992
Uh, yeah.
Okay. I know what you're doing,

77
00:03:16,994 --> 00:03:19,628
so let me be more specific.
Did you read my report?

78
00:03:20,898 --> 00:03:22,664
Come on. 25 pages

79
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,733
detailing the customs and
history of the three countries

80
00:03:24,735 --> 00:03:25,868
who are meeting today.

81
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,469
It's important.

82
00:03:27,471 --> 00:03:30,038
I understand.
But, uh, so is this,

83
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,607
and I just didn't
get around to it.

84
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:33,075
Uh, why did you write it anyway?

85
00:03:33,077 --> 00:03:35,744
I never asked you to.
Well, truth is,

86
00:03:35,746 --> 00:03:38,480
I'm taking night classes.
One's on European history.

87
00:03:38,482 --> 00:03:41,683
Had a paper due. We had this
case coming up, so, you know,

88
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:43,519
I figured two birds,
one stone.

89
00:03:43,521 --> 00:03:45,821
You dropped out of college.

90
00:03:45,823 --> 00:03:49,291
I re-enrolled
to finish my degree, yeah.

91
00:03:49,293 --> 00:03:50,526
Uh-huh. Why?
To learn,

92
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:51,794
for the betterment
of myself,

93
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:54,196
and to set a good example for Ralph.
I get that.

94
00:03:54,198 --> 00:03:56,231
It's great
that you're pursuing education,

95
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:58,700
but why European history?

96
00:03:58,702 --> 00:04:01,136
Liberal arts
are complete nonsense.

97
00:04:01,138 --> 00:04:02,771
Oh, I couldn't disagree more.

98
00:04:02,773 --> 00:04:04,840
The information that you receive
is strictly dependent

99
00:04:04,842 --> 00:04:08,443
on the beliefs of whoever
authored the textbooks.

100
00:04:08,445 --> 00:04:12,281
There are only four subjects
worth studying: science and math

101
00:04:12,283 --> 00:04:13,782
and math and science.
Okay,

102
00:04:13,784 --> 00:04:17,019
so when you meet the Lithuanian
president, what will you do?

103
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:19,822
I'll say hello and shake his hand.
Mm-hmm.

104
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:21,690
And that could be disastrous
because when you shake the hands

105
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:23,859
of a Lithuanian in the
threshold of a room,

106
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:25,828
it's considered insulting.

107
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,697
If the fate of civilization
rests on where we shake hands

108
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:32,167
with these people,
then we're all doomed.

109
00:04:44,181 --> 00:04:46,281
Hey, Hopalong.

110
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:48,116
We're about to hop along,
so why don't you stop

111
00:04:48,118 --> 00:04:51,086
watching that movie
for the 12th time?

112
00:04:51,088 --> 00:04:53,121
This movie was filmed
on the senator's compound

113
00:04:53,123 --> 00:04:54,857
where the summit's taking place.

114
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:56,925
I'm studying the layout
of the grounds

115
00:04:56,927 --> 00:04:59,228
'cause some of the sets are
still standing on the property.

116
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,263
You already walked the
ground with Homeland.

117
00:05:01,265 --> 00:05:03,265
You're a fanboy.

118
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:07,536
Next time, let your horse do
the thinking.

119
00:05:07,538 --> 00:05:09,471
He's smarter.

120
00:05:09,473 --> 00:05:12,641
They don't make classics
like this anymore.

121
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:15,577
Fanboy.

122
00:05:16,914 --> 00:05:18,380
Hey, you got
a second?

123
00:05:18,382 --> 00:05:19,514
What are you doing?

124
00:05:19,516 --> 00:05:20,549
With what?

125
00:05:20,551 --> 00:05:21,617
Hand, back.

126
00:05:21,619 --> 00:05:23,518
Yours, mine.
Oh.

127
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,754
Sorry, I didn't
even notice.

128
00:05:25,756 --> 00:05:28,523
Yesterday, you brushed
a leaf from my hair,

129
00:05:28,525 --> 00:05:30,359
and on Tuesday
you laughed hysterically

130
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:31,560
at something I said.

131
00:05:31,562 --> 00:05:33,061
How do you know
it wasn't funny?

132
00:05:33,063 --> 00:05:34,429
I was reading a menu.

133
00:05:34,431 --> 00:05:36,365
Pupu platter?

134
00:05:36,367 --> 00:05:39,301
I can't help but feel
something's changed.

135
00:05:39,303 --> 00:05:41,069
Are you referring to our kiss?
Don't...

136
00:05:41,071 --> 00:05:42,071
say it.

137
00:05:42,072 --> 00:05:43,505
Kiss.

138
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:45,641
Almost kiss.

139
00:05:45,643 --> 00:05:49,144
It didn't happen.

140
00:05:50,814 --> 00:05:52,814
Yet.

141
00:06:04,662 --> 00:06:06,695
That's Lithuanian President

142
00:06:06,697 --> 00:06:10,766
Dmitri Kreshenko and
his chief advisor Mikko Aleska.

143
00:06:10,768 --> 00:06:12,034
Mikko's a big fella.

144
00:06:12,036 --> 00:06:13,235
Over there is
Belarus President

145
00:06:13,237 --> 00:06:14,303
Boris Sakovich

146
00:06:14,305 --> 00:06:16,038
and his entourage,

147
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,608
and finally
Latvian President Juris Nikonov.

148
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,909
Th-That's actually
Latvian Prime Minister.

149
00:06:20,911 --> 00:06:24,212
Their president's more
of a figurehead.

150
00:06:24,214 --> 00:06:26,581
You didn't read
my report either.

151
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,450
All right,
let's get to work.

152
00:06:28,452 --> 00:06:29,952
Director Merrick.

153
00:06:29,954 --> 00:06:31,386
Ah, Ms. Munoz.

154
00:06:31,388 --> 00:06:32,854
Cabe, this is
René Munoz,

155
00:06:32,856 --> 00:06:34,656
Assistant Secretary,
State Department.

156
00:06:34,658 --> 00:06:37,225
Since there's a good chance
that things could become

157
00:06:37,227 --> 00:06:38,226
tense over the next few days...

158
00:06:38,228 --> 00:06:39,695
I'm here to
keep these guys

159
00:06:39,697 --> 00:06:42,197
away from each other's throats
and at the bargaining table.

160
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:44,032
Great. Right now we need
to get these men in front

161
00:06:44,034 --> 00:06:45,867
of the green screens and
make it look like they're back

162
00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:47,502
in their home countries
and not here.

163
00:06:47,504 --> 00:06:49,504
Anything gets lost
in translation,

164
00:06:49,506 --> 00:06:50,372
we'll reach out.

165
00:06:50,374 --> 00:06:51,907
Understood.

166
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:54,643
Excuse me. René.

167
00:06:54,645 --> 00:06:57,012
Uh, I wrote a report
on the historical customs

168
00:06:57,014 --> 00:06:59,781
and traditions of these nations,
if this could be of any help.

169
00:06:59,783 --> 00:07:01,316
Uh, thanks.
I'll refer to it

170
00:07:01,318 --> 00:07:02,684
if I get in a jam.

171
00:07:25,743 --> 00:07:27,075
Okay, cut!

172
00:07:27,077 --> 00:07:28,877
What the hell
is he doing?

173
00:07:29,446 --> 00:07:30,779
What are you typing?

174
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:33,849
Nothing. I'm pretending.

175
00:07:33,851 --> 00:07:36,184
An eight-year-old
with a DVR can slo-mo this

176
00:07:36,186 --> 00:07:37,953
and see every
keystroke.

177
00:07:37,955 --> 00:07:39,221
If this does not
read as real,

178
00:07:39,223 --> 00:07:42,024
then all of it
was a waste of time.

179
00:07:42,026 --> 00:07:43,425
So can you please stop
pretending

180
00:07:43,427 --> 00:07:44,593
and actually type something?

181
00:07:44,595 --> 00:07:46,361
Thank you, sir.
Walter, you just need to...

182
00:07:46,363 --> 00:07:48,830
Mr. President, you can type
whatever you'd like. We'll just

183
00:07:48,832 --> 00:07:50,766
raise the camera an inch
so no one sees your fingers.

184
00:07:50,768 --> 00:07:52,434
Is that acceptable?

185
00:07:52,436 --> 00:07:54,102
Thank you, sir.

186
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:56,405
Okay.

187
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:58,306
What was that?

188
00:07:58,308 --> 00:08:00,308
He was doing it wrong.
And over the next few days,

189
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,144
we'll need to make a half
dozen of these videos,

190
00:08:02,146 --> 00:08:04,613
so I need to nip
bad habits in the bud.

191
00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:06,715
Me, too.
So I'll be clear.

192
00:08:06,717 --> 00:08:08,750
You do not talk to a president
like that.

193
00:08:12,022 --> 00:08:14,556
And, you, you do not
talk to a president at all.

194
00:08:14,558 --> 00:08:16,491
I was just trying to help.

195
00:08:16,493 --> 00:08:18,093
Want to help?

196
00:08:18,095 --> 00:08:19,928
Stay on the sidelines.

197
00:08:29,473 --> 00:08:32,741
Is it just me, or does this feel
like a seventh grade dance?

198
00:08:32,743 --> 00:08:34,509
I didn't go
to the seventh grade dance.

199
00:08:34,511 --> 00:08:37,879
Me neither, but I imagine
this is what it was like.

200
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:40,482
Typical.

201
00:08:40,484 --> 00:08:43,351
We sit here in silence
while neither of you are willing

202
00:08:43,353 --> 00:08:45,720
to extend
the first olive branch.

203
00:08:45,722 --> 00:08:47,722
We have all traveled
the same distance.

204
00:08:47,724 --> 00:08:49,458
I do not hear
you making offers.

205
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,725
This summit was my idea.

206
00:08:50,727 --> 00:08:51,727
That is my offer.

207
00:08:51,728 --> 00:08:53,595
I suggest this a year ago.

208
00:08:53,597 --> 00:08:55,797
Now it's your idea?

209
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,365
Gentlemen,
I respectfully submit

210
00:08:57,367 --> 00:09:00,001
that we all follow the rules
of parliamentary procedure,

211
00:09:00,003 --> 00:09:01,903
which we all agreed to

212
00:09:01,905 --> 00:09:03,738
- prior to today.
- We also agreed

213
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,608
to no more military border
maneuvers.

214
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:07,609
And their army
has since positioned...

215
00:09:07,611 --> 00:09:09,611
Hey, you know what?

216
00:09:09,613 --> 00:09:11,613
Uh, I suggest
some honey mead.

217
00:09:16,787 --> 00:09:18,019
What are you talking about?
Come on, gentlemen.

218
00:09:18,021 --> 00:09:19,454
I know someone here brought
the mead.

219
00:09:19,456 --> 00:09:20,456
How else would we toast

220
00:09:20,457 --> 00:09:23,258
to peace when this
is all over?

221
00:09:24,128 --> 00:09:26,828
Drinks are a good idea.

222
00:09:27,965 --> 00:09:30,899
In these nations, you don't
fix emotional arguments

223
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:32,567
with rules of procedure.

224
00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:33,835
You grease the wheel
with a tradition

225
00:09:33,837 --> 00:09:35,837
old enough
that they all lay claim to it.

226
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,246
I want her off the grounds. Now.

227
00:09:44,248 --> 00:09:45,480
Like hell.

228
00:09:45,482 --> 00:09:48,283
She just did your job for you.

229
00:09:48,285 --> 00:09:51,386
It's just pouring drinks, but
she's got them working together.

230
00:09:51,388 --> 00:09:53,321
She stays.

231
00:09:53,323 --> 00:09:54,789
Okay.

232
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,124
Raise your glasses.

233
00:09:56,126 --> 00:09:57,893
<i>Sveiks.</i>

234
00:10:06,803 --> 00:10:08,537
Mr. President!
Mr. Kreshenko!

235
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:10,071
I'll get the doctor!

236
00:10:11,742 --> 00:10:14,075
Mr. President!
Mr. Kreshenko!

237
00:10:14,077 --> 00:10:14,943
Mikko!

238
00:10:16,513 --> 00:10:18,613
Whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

239
00:10:18,615 --> 00:10:21,149
I'm an MD. Shut up.
I need to hear his breathing.

240
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:22,250
Doc, what the hell's going on?

241
00:10:22,252 --> 00:10:24,352
Well, he's been poisoned.

242
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:27,322
This is Dr. Chong.

243
00:10:27,324 --> 00:10:29,090
He is a U.N.-certified physician
assigned to the summit.

244
00:10:29,092 --> 00:10:31,193
You will all pay
for what you've done!

245
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:32,594
Yashin!

246
00:10:33,263 --> 00:10:34,796
Hey, hey, hey!

247
00:10:36,867 --> 00:10:38,233
Put down your weapons!

248
00:10:40,971 --> 00:10:42,304
You're outmanned
and you're outgunned!

249
00:10:42,306 --> 00:10:43,505
Now lower
your weapons!

250
00:10:43,507 --> 00:10:45,006
Actually, uh, Cabe,

251
00:10:45,008 --> 00:10:47,008
you're wrong.

252
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,444
The firepower is...

253
00:10:49,446 --> 00:10:50,912
evenly matched.

254
00:10:50,914 --> 00:10:53,515
If everyone were
to fire simultaneously,

255
00:10:53,517 --> 00:10:54,783
then those two gentlemen
over there

256
00:10:54,785 --> 00:10:57,652
would kill each other,
that Marine over there

257
00:10:57,654 --> 00:10:59,821
would take out Yashin,
the falling bodies would

258
00:10:59,823 --> 00:11:01,790
expose those behind them
to oncoming fire

259
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:03,391
from the other
Marines,

260
00:11:03,393 --> 00:11:06,595
and we would wind up with--
excuse me-- three dead

261
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:07,929
security personnel

262
00:11:07,931 --> 00:11:09,164
and three dead politicians.

263
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,333
Based on quick vector
and percentage

264
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:14,336
calculation,
almost 100% certainty.

265
00:11:14,338 --> 00:11:15,937
Sylvester, how are my numbers?

266
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:18,306
Sounds pretty good to me.

267
00:11:18,308 --> 00:11:20,775
It's actually four
dead politicians

268
00:11:20,777 --> 00:11:22,410
if Kreshenko
isn't treated ASAP.

269
00:11:22,412 --> 00:11:23,778
This was a setup!

270
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,747
You brought the bottle.

271
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:27,582
Sakovich poured it,

272
00:11:27,584 --> 00:11:29,584
and Juris passed it out.
Everyone had access.

273
00:11:29,586 --> 00:11:30,919
No one knows
what happened,

274
00:11:30,921 --> 00:11:33,121
except somebody was
planning this all along,

275
00:11:33,123 --> 00:11:35,590
and the mead was the
perfect opportunity.

276
00:11:35,592 --> 00:11:37,592
Now, this man needs
medical care, stat.

277
00:11:37,594 --> 00:11:39,894
No one goes in or
out of the grounds.

278
00:11:39,896 --> 00:11:41,696
From here out,
everyone is

279
00:11:41,698 --> 00:11:42,698
a suspect.

280
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:44,132
We're on lockdown.

281
00:11:48,472 --> 00:11:50,505
Pulse is dropping significantly.

282
00:11:50,507 --> 00:11:52,240
Heart rate's slowed to 42 bpm.

283
00:11:54,811 --> 00:11:57,012
He's in bradycardia.
Whatever poison he's ingested,

284
00:11:57,014 --> 00:11:58,014
it's taking hold.

285
00:11:58,015 --> 00:11:59,180
I have adrenaline in my kit.

286
00:11:59,182 --> 00:12:01,716
If I mix it exactly
with the atropine

287
00:12:01,718 --> 00:12:03,285
and nifedipine,
that may buy some time.

288
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:04,653
How long?
Without an antidote?

289
00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:06,488
This man will be dead
in 90 minutes.

290
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,089
We can't access
an antidote because

291
00:12:08,091 --> 00:12:09,958
we don't know
what the poison is.

292
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,495
Things might get a lot worse
before they get better.

293
00:12:13,497 --> 00:12:15,697
Paige, you did a good job
of calming things down earlier.

294
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:17,565
Go see if you can't
settle them down again.

295
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:18,425
I'm gonna go with her.

296
00:12:18,426 --> 00:12:19,666
Maybe I can read
some guilt markers.

297
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,059
If we find the culprit,
we'll have a better chance

298
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:22,300
of figuring out
what was put in his drink.

299
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,324
Go.

300
00:12:25,342 --> 00:12:27,108
We all know what happens
if word gets out

301
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,343
that there was
an assassination attempt

302
00:12:28,345 --> 00:12:30,045
during furtive
peace talks.

303
00:12:30,047 --> 00:12:32,714
Weaponry will be readied,
military strikes commenced.

304
00:12:32,716 --> 00:12:35,016
And that'll be the start
of World War Three.

305

I know this isn't good,

308
00:12:50,697 --> 00:12:52,797
but do we really think
a world war can break out

309
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:55,266
from the death
of the president of the 89th

310
00:12:55,268 --> 00:12:57,068
most populated nation
on the planet?

311
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,436
World War One
started because

312
00:12:58,438 --> 00:13:00,972
of the assassination of
the Archduke Franz Ferdinand,

313
00:13:00,974 --> 00:13:04,142
a man that 99% of the planet
had never even heard of,

314
00:13:04,144 --> 00:13:05,610
so not only is
it possible,

315
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:06,944
but it's happened already.

316
00:13:06,946 --> 00:13:09,614
We have to prevent these guys

317
00:13:09,616 --> 00:13:12,783
from transmitting any
communications from this ranch.

318
00:13:12,785 --> 00:13:16,654
We could piggyback on the Wi-Fi
to place our own virtual

319
00:13:16,656 --> 00:13:18,422
local area network

320
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:19,957
around the entire compound.

321
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:21,292
Like a cyber noose.

322
00:13:21,294 --> 00:13:23,861
We'll capture any e-mails,
texts, phone calls

323
00:13:23,863 --> 00:13:25,463
from anyone on this property.

324
00:13:25,465 --> 00:13:27,064
We can't let them know we muzzled them.
They won't.

325
00:13:27,066 --> 00:13:28,666
They'll think their messages
are being received,

326
00:13:28,668 --> 00:13:30,501
because Sylvester will respond

327
00:13:30,503 --> 00:13:31,736
posing as
their associates.

328
00:13:31,738 --> 00:13:32,937
Remember back at the garage

329
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:34,705
when I said I was
uncomfortable with deception?

330
00:13:34,707 --> 00:13:35,673
Uh-huh.

331
00:13:35,675 --> 00:13:36,908
Uh-huh.
Mm-hmm.

332
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,476
Still uncomfortable.

333
00:13:51,658 --> 00:13:52,623
Please, if you'll just...

334
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,791
Can you even read them

335
00:13:53,793 --> 00:13:55,393
when you don't know
what they're saying?

336
00:13:55,395 --> 00:13:57,428
Universal micro-tells
transcend language,

337
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,096
but they're politicians;
they're trained liars.

338
00:13:59,098 --> 00:14:00,731
So I'm getting bubkes.

339
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:02,099
If they calm down,

340
00:14:02,101 --> 00:14:04,802
I might be able
to pick up on something.

341
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,640
I think I have an idea.

342
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,280
Don't keep me in the dark.
What are you up to?

343
00:14:16,282 --> 00:14:17,982
Mitzy Von Schneiden.

344
00:14:17,984 --> 00:14:20,384
Singer from the 1920s
whose mother was Latvian,

345
00:14:20,386 --> 00:14:21,752
dad was Lithuanian.

346
00:14:21,754 --> 00:14:22,887
She studied in Belarus.

347
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:24,288
They all adore her.

348
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,725
And it's hard to keep
fighting when listening to

349
00:14:27,727 --> 00:14:29,594
the lullaby
your mother used to sing you.

350
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,798
That's actually a good idea.

351
00:14:44,477 --> 00:14:47,678
This song is beautiful.

352
00:14:50,617 --> 00:14:52,083
If Kreshenko dies,

353
00:14:52,085 --> 00:14:54,151
hopefully
a<i> pill-naja-bura</i>

354
00:14:54,153 --> 00:14:55,987
doesn't keep us
from his funeral.

355
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,923
Oh, God.

356
00:14:58,925 --> 00:15:01,859
Toby, I think I know
what was given to Kreshenko.

357
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,201
Cyber noose is trapping
a lot of e-mails

358
00:15:10,203 --> 00:15:13,304
and text messages--
all to colleagues back home,

359
00:15:13,306 --> 00:15:14,839
all of shock and dismay
at the poisoning.

360
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:16,207
Nothing nefarious here yet,
either.

361
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:17,308
Hopefully this will

362
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,744
keep his heart going
until we can determine

363
00:15:19,746 --> 00:15:22,380
- exactly what we need to do.
- No!

364
00:15:24,984 --> 00:15:26,484
What the hell?

365
00:15:26,486 --> 00:15:28,452
Gallo...
What is your man doing?

366
00:15:28,454 --> 00:15:30,588
That adrenaline would've
killed him instantly.

367
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,024
Paige. The... the dust storm.

368
00:15:33,026 --> 00:15:34,692
Merrick, it all makes sense.

369
00:15:34,694 --> 00:15:36,027
The guy from Belarus

370
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:37,128
whispered the words
<i>pill-naja-bura.</i>

371
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,864
That's “dust storm”
in Belarusian,

372
00:15:39,866 --> 00:15:41,399
effectively a curse word
in the nation's history.

373
00:15:41,401 --> 00:15:43,401
And it all started
with the venom from a snake.

374
00:15:43,403 --> 00:15:45,603
In 1897, the
first war between

375
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:48,372
Belarus and Lithuania broke out
after what was deemed to be

376
00:15:48,374 --> 00:15:50,608
blatant disrespect
by the Belarus government.

377
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,842
I don't need
a book report right now.

378
00:15:51,844 --> 00:15:53,711
She actually has
some good ideas.

379
00:15:53,713 --> 00:15:55,680
- Paige, go on.
- Okay, so,

380
00:15:55,682 --> 00:15:57,181
the Lithuanian
president's child

381
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,684
died after being bitten
by a venomous snake,

382
00:15:59,686 --> 00:16:02,019
and the Belarus diplomats
didn't show up for the funeral.

383
00:16:02,021 --> 00:16:04,488
The excuse was that there was
this terrible dust storm.

384
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,657
But that excuse wasn't accepted,
and what followed

385
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:08,459
was a four-year war

386
00:16:08,461 --> 00:16:09,794
and the tensions
we're still seeing today.

387
00:16:09,796 --> 00:16:11,228
According to Paige,
the venom in the boy

388
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,297
caused an immediate
red spread, hives

389
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:15,499
in the arms and neck,
just like Kreshenko.

390
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:16,867
If the venom was given to him

391
00:16:16,869 --> 00:16:19,036
as a symbolic “screw you,”
then that adrenaline

392
00:16:19,038 --> 00:16:21,539
will make the venom work faster
and kill him instantly.

393
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:22,873
You know, Gallo,
you listening to these loons

394
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,775
is one thing,
but now you got the waitress

395
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:26,544
- calling the shots?
- Are we judging people

396
00:16:26,546 --> 00:16:28,379
based on past resumes?

397
00:16:28,381 --> 00:16:29,647
Because you were

398
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:33,150
a department store Santa to
help pay for your college.

399
00:16:33,152 --> 00:16:35,486
How the hell
did you find that out?

400
00:16:35,488 --> 00:16:38,456
Look, the point is, if we don't
get meds into Kreshenko

401
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,790
and he dies, it's our asses.

402
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:41,892
If you're wrong,
he'll die instantly.

403
00:16:41,894 --> 00:16:43,427
Yeah, and if she's wrong,
then we had a chance

404
00:16:43,429 --> 00:16:44,595
to save a president
and we didn't.

405
00:16:44,597 --> 00:16:45,629
Debating this
wastes precious time.

406
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:47,131
Now, Paige,
it's up to you, okay?

407
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:48,899
How certain are you
of what you heard?

408
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:51,869
I'm 100% confident
in what I heard

409
00:16:51,871 --> 00:16:53,270
and what I'm telling you.

410
00:16:53,272 --> 00:16:54,772
Then there's our answer.

411
00:16:54,774 --> 00:16:56,173
This is ridiculous.

412
00:16:56,175 --> 00:16:59,043
I started a course
of treatment for this man.

413
00:16:59,045 --> 00:17:01,379
I'm finishing the protocol.

414
00:17:01,381 --> 00:17:02,847
Hey!

415
00:17:02,849 --> 00:17:05,116
Are you out of your mind?

416
00:17:05,118 --> 00:17:08,018
That was the only adrenaline
I had on site!

417
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,689
I trust my team.

418
00:17:11,691 --> 00:17:14,692
The safe call
was to follow procedure.

419
00:17:14,694 --> 00:17:16,460
And if he died, he died.

420
00:17:16,462 --> 00:17:17,828
Now it's our necks.

421
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,263
I'm gonna arrest
President Sakovich,

422
00:17:19,265 --> 00:17:21,932
but the lockdown
pertains to all of you.

423
00:17:21,934 --> 00:17:24,101
Nobody leaves the grounds
until that man

424
00:17:24,103 --> 00:17:25,536
is either saved

425
00:17:25,538 --> 00:17:26,737
or he's dead.

426
00:17:26,739 --> 00:17:28,839
'Cause I am not eating
this bullet alone

427
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:30,341
if this goes south.

428
00:17:34,714 --> 00:17:36,447
Forget Homeland,
he should work for the Treasury

429
00:17:36,449 --> 00:17:37,748
the way he passes the buck.

430
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,450
Focus. We have barely an hour,

431
00:17:39,452 --> 00:17:41,652
and we don't know what kind
of venom we're dealing with.

432
00:17:41,654 --> 00:17:43,387
There are
numerous deadly

433
00:17:43,389 --> 00:17:46,323
Eastern European snakes,
several of which can cause

434
00:17:46,325 --> 00:17:47,992
reddish hives.
Sly, Toby,

435
00:17:47,994 --> 00:17:49,560
you figure out what kind of
Belarusian snake

436
00:17:49,562 --> 00:17:50,895
we're looking for.
Happy, Paige, and I--

437
00:17:50,897 --> 00:17:53,898
we'll go down to the reptile
sanctuary down the PCH.

438
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,199
Then when we get there,
you can tell us

439
00:17:55,201 --> 00:17:56,434
what kind of snake
we need to procure.

440
00:17:56,436 --> 00:17:58,936
Then we'll make an
antidote with its venom.

441
00:17:58,938 --> 00:18:01,806
You heard Merrick.
No one's going anywhere.

442
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:04,575
I think I have a way
around that.

443
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:17,629
Zoom in,
camera one, north gate.

444
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:20,999
Someone's taking pictures.

445
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:23,168
Get Director Merrick.
Sir.

446
00:18:29,874 --> 00:18:31,207
Oh, they bought it.

447
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:33,509
Great, just-just keep that
camera in front of your face.

448
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:34,777
Come and get me, dummies.

449
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:38,314
All corps
to the north gate. Now!

450
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:41,617
All right, come on. Hustle.
Where we going?

451
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:43,719
Right here.
Okay, hurry.

452
00:18:43,721 --> 00:18:45,120
Okay, come on.

453
00:18:45,122 --> 00:18:46,989
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
Come on.

454
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,026
Cabe, I do not mean to rush you,
but if they come back here

455
00:18:51,028 --> 00:18:52,928
and we're trapped...
It's in here somewhere.

456
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,731
DVD commentary on<i> Blackrock</i>
<i>Shootout</i> said they left intact

457
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:58,500
the secret door
the deputy used to escape.

458
00:18:58,502 --> 00:19:01,003
Pays to be a fanboy.

459
00:19:01,005 --> 00:19:03,272
All right, head east over that
hill; there should be a trail,

460
00:19:03,274 --> 00:19:05,741
take you to a road.
Now go get us a snake.

461
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:08,110
See you later.

462
00:19:08,112 --> 00:19:10,212
Come on, let's go.

463
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,916
Sir!

464
00:19:13,918 --> 00:19:16,418
I checked the perimeter
from that bluff.

465
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,487
There's no sign of anyone,
not even vehicle tracks.

466
00:19:18,489 --> 00:19:20,256
Well, he's got to be
here somewhere.

467
00:19:20,258 --> 00:19:22,625
It's not like the guy
just appeared and disappeared.

468
00:19:24,462 --> 00:19:26,528
Son of a bitch.

469
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,830
Hurry up.

470
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:30,065
I don't want any evidence
of what we've been up to.

471
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:32,034
Gallo!

472
00:19:32,637 --> 00:19:35,437
You two, get out.

473
00:19:36,707 --> 00:19:38,841
Ooh, Cabe's in trouble.

474
00:19:38,843 --> 00:19:41,710
Do you have Stockholm syndrome?

475
00:19:41,712 --> 00:19:43,679
Just do whatever
these eggheads say?

476
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:46,649
What you did is insubordination,
borderline treason.

477
00:19:46,651 --> 00:19:48,183
I made a choice
to save a man's life.

478
00:19:48,185 --> 00:19:50,619
No, you made a choice to
defy me and to back them.

479
00:19:50,621 --> 00:19:52,588
You don't work as closely
with Scorpion as I do.

480
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,490
You just don't know
how they go about things.

481
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:56,392
I know that you've
been mesmerized

482
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:58,227
by this kid Walter from
the minute you met him.

483
00:19:58,229 --> 00:20:01,096
I'm no more mesmerized by him
than you are threatened.

484
00:20:01,098 --> 00:20:04,333
And our job is
to protect people,

485
00:20:04,335 --> 00:20:06,869
Now, let me ask
you a question.

486
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:09,471
You think that you and Walter
would be such great pals

487
00:20:09,473 --> 00:20:11,674
if he knew what really
happened in Baghdad

488
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:13,542
with that software
you had him make?

489
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:17,012
What if I tell him?

490
00:20:17,014 --> 00:20:20,182
Let me be clear.

491
00:20:20,184 --> 00:20:22,351
What Walter knows

492
00:20:22,353 --> 00:20:24,887
and what he needs to know
is up to me.

493
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:28,724
If you disclose anything to him,
you and I will have a problem

494
00:20:28,726 --> 00:20:31,560
where rank doesn't
come into play.

495
00:20:31,562 --> 00:20:33,762
Do you copy?

496
00:20:42,006 --> 00:20:43,405
Not sure where we are,

497
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:45,874
but I know it's nowhere
near the reptile sanctuary.

498
00:20:45,876 --> 00:20:48,110
Now what?
Hitchhike?

499
00:20:48,112 --> 00:20:49,278
I'm not showing leg.

500
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,380
No, there's no time
to hitchhike.

501
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:54,316
Happy, I hear a truck. Quick.

502
00:20:54,318 --> 00:20:55,851
Punch me in the nose.

503
00:20:55,853 --> 00:20:57,619
Finally.

504
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:01,023
Good job.

505
00:21:04,195 --> 00:21:05,761
What is he doing?

506
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:08,864
Hey! Hey!

507
00:21:16,007 --> 00:21:17,339
Hey, man, you okay?

508
00:21:17,341 --> 00:21:19,108
Not really. I was hiking,
and I fell on my face.

509
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,576
Have you got any ice?

510
00:21:20,578 --> 00:21:22,211
Some ice? Yeah, yeah, sure.
Come around back.

511
00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:23,979
Okay.

512
00:21:27,985 --> 00:21:29,852
Hey.

513
00:21:32,023 --> 00:21:33,355
Come on in.

514
00:21:33,357 --> 00:21:34,656
Thanks.

515
00:21:34,658 --> 00:21:36,825
Here's your ice.
Thank you. Also, sorry.

516
00:21:36,827 --> 00:21:38,327
What's up?
Hit it, Happy!

517
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,629
We'll return it!

518
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:42,097
Official government business!

519
00:21:44,335 --> 00:21:47,002
Okay, so we get
to the reptile sanctuary...

520
00:21:47,004 --> 00:21:50,272
find the curator,
have him get us the right snake.

521
00:21:50,274 --> 00:21:51,940
Yeah, what are we gonna do?

522
00:21:51,942 --> 00:21:54,843
We gonna tell him someone
we know, but can't disclose,

523
00:21:54,845 --> 00:21:56,812
has been bitten
by a deadly snake

524
00:21:56,814 --> 00:21:59,515
that may or may not be native
to this area,

525
00:21:59,517 --> 00:22:01,884
and he just has to trust us
and give us that snake,

526
00:22:01,886 --> 00:22:03,285
even though venomous snakes
are regulated by the state,

527
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:06,321
and giving us one
could land him in prison?

528
00:22:06,323 --> 00:22:08,690
Oh, you got a better idea?
We steal the snake.

529
00:22:08,692 --> 00:22:10,325
We steal the snake.

530
00:22:16,534 --> 00:22:19,034
This is a violation
of the Geneva Convention.

531
00:22:19,036 --> 00:22:20,803
So is assassination.

532
00:22:20,805 --> 00:22:22,037
You pig!

533
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:24,139
I will kill you
for what you've done!

534
00:22:24,742 --> 00:22:25,841
Now, I told you once,

535
00:22:25,843 --> 00:22:27,743
you keep cool,
or I'll cuff you

536
00:22:27,745 --> 00:22:29,078
right alongside these men.

537
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:44,460
There are too many
Belarusian snakes.

538
00:22:44,462 --> 00:22:46,728
There's no way
to know which one it is.

539
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:49,131
Is that what you're gonna
tell Walter when we call him?

540
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:50,799
I don't know anything
about snakes.

541
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:52,334
This wasn't even my idea.

542
00:22:52,336 --> 00:22:55,037
Ah, ah,
there's no “I” in Scorpion.

543
00:22:56,407 --> 00:22:58,273
It's a figure of speech.
Oh.

544
00:22:58,275 --> 00:23:00,709
Cyber noose just got another
text. This one's from Mikko.

545
00:23:00,711 --> 00:23:03,612
I'm putting it
in the translator now.

546
00:23:03,614 --> 00:23:05,380
“Everything is in place,
moving forward”?

547
00:23:05,382 --> 00:23:07,015
I don't like the sound of that.

548
00:23:07,017 --> 00:23:09,251
You know, it's ambiguous.
It could mean nothing.

549
00:23:09,253 --> 00:23:11,520
The man's president is dying.
He's not gonna send

550
00:23:11,522 --> 00:23:13,288
an international text
to someone that means nothing.

551
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,456
That's ambiguous on purpose,

552
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:16,158
but it means something.
What?

553
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,628
You think Mikko could be the one
who slipped his boss a mickey?

554
00:23:20,965 --> 00:23:23,198
The text was meant
for someone named

555
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,401
Eras Ilgauskas,
and a quick search shows that

556
00:23:26,403 --> 00:23:27,870
he's a wealthy manufacturer in

557
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:29,538
artillery production
and distribution.

558
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,315
You think Mikko could be
in the weapons game with him?

559
00:23:31,339 --> 00:23:32,275
That would explain

560
00:23:32,276 --> 00:23:34,743
why he did something that could
cause World War Three.

561
00:23:34,745 --> 00:23:36,745
If Kreshenko signs that peace
treaty, then there's no war,

562
00:23:36,747 --> 00:23:38,814
and if there's no war,
there's no weapons to sell.

563
00:23:38,816 --> 00:23:40,749
We arrested the wrong guys.

564
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:43,152
And we're looking for
the wrong type of snake.

565
00:23:43,154 --> 00:23:44,286
Killer's not from Belarus.

566
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:45,721
We need something from
the Lithuanian region.

567
00:23:45,723 --> 00:23:47,156
That's where Mikko's from.

568
00:23:47,158 --> 00:23:48,490
And there's only one snake

569
00:23:48,492 --> 00:23:50,325
that matches our specific
set of symptoms.

570
00:23:50,327 --> 00:23:51,693
The adder.

571
00:24:00,304 --> 00:24:02,271
Toby says we got the wrong guys.

572
00:24:02,273 --> 00:24:03,972
It was Kreshenko's advisor.

573
00:24:03,974 --> 00:24:05,107
The snake we're looking for
is the adder.

574
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:06,508
I hacked
the sanctuary's schematics.

575
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:09,077
The best route to the snake is
the side employees' entrance.

576
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:10,179
Once in, to avoid security,

577
00:24:10,181 --> 00:24:11,680
you're gonna have
to use the cross beams

578
00:24:11,682 --> 00:24:13,882
above the displays.

579
00:24:13,884 --> 00:24:15,450
I didn't design
the building, man.

580
00:24:18,155 --> 00:24:20,289
We can still communicate
within the cyber noose,

581
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:22,658
so we need to
respond to his text.

582
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,093
There's no way Mikko doesn't
expect to hear back from him,

583
00:24:25,095 --> 00:24:26,695
a co-conspirator in
an assassination.

584
00:24:26,697 --> 00:24:29,298
If he doesn't, he'll get suspicious.
What do I say?

585
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,099
Uh, needs to be ambiguous,
as well.

586
00:24:31,101 --> 00:24:33,302
Just confirmation of receipt.

587
00:24:33,304 --> 00:24:34,636
That's what they
would've planned.

588
00:24:34,638 --> 00:24:36,738
Okay. How about “Thank you”?
Sure.

589
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,641
Why don't you put a thumbs up
emoticon at the end of it, too?

590
00:24:39,643 --> 00:24:41,310
Just send “Confirmed”"

591
00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:44,313
No. Send... “Okay”"

592
00:24:44,315 --> 00:24:47,115
No! Send “Okay.
Confirmed”"

593
00:24:47,117 --> 00:24:49,818
You're confusing me.
Just send “Confirmed”"

594
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,054
That's it.
Just send that.

595
00:24:52,056 --> 00:24:54,756
Sent. You think he'll buy it?
Yeah.

596
00:24:54,758 --> 00:24:56,541
Unless they had a specific
code word planned in advance.

597
00:24:56,565 --> 00:24:57,327
Yeah.

598
00:24:57,328 --> 00:24:59,461
Let's go tell Cabe
we got our guy.

599
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,666
I think they had a code word.

600
00:25:04,668 --> 00:25:05,934
Is that him?

601
00:25:05,936 --> 00:25:07,903
No. That's the running
of the bulls in Ventura.

602
00:25:07,905 --> 00:25:09,004
Yes, it's him!
Okay.

603
00:25:09,006 --> 00:25:11,406
What do I do?
What do I do?

604
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:16,445
You are
the computer experts, no?

605
00:25:16,447 --> 00:25:18,347
No.

606
00:25:22,286 --> 00:25:23,518
We dabble.

607
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,555
Give me your phone.

608
00:25:26,557 --> 00:25:27,990
Easy, Mongo.

609
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:30,692
I know you texted me!

610
00:25:32,463 --> 00:25:33,962
Hit him, Sly!

611
00:25:33,964 --> 00:25:35,897
Okay!
Hit him! I got him!

612
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:47,609
Stop! U.S. Marine!

613
00:25:47,611 --> 00:25:49,411
He's the assassin!

614
00:25:50,514 --> 00:25:52,814
Got eyes on him!

615
00:25:53,784 --> 00:25:54,683
Are you okay, Sly?

616
00:25:54,685 --> 00:25:55,917
What the hell happened?

617
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,320
You guys all right?
It was Mikko.

618
00:25:58,322 --> 00:26:00,822
He framed
those Belarus boys.

619
00:26:00,824 --> 00:26:02,524
Big guy's fast.

620
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:08,063
Welcome, gang.

621
00:26:08,065 --> 00:26:10,365
Got a lot of neat stuff
to see and learn today,

622
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:11,466
so head on in.

623
00:26:11,468 --> 00:26:12,968
Just follow
these footprints.

624
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,002
Excuse me, sir.

625
00:26:14,004 --> 00:26:15,537
Can you help me?

626
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:17,506
I am the teacher's assistant
with this class,

627
00:26:17,508 --> 00:26:21,910
but I... I'm so terrified
of snakes, and I was...

628
00:26:21,912 --> 00:26:24,746
C-Can you stand
with me during

629
00:26:24,748 --> 00:26:26,348
your presentation,
please?

630
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,616
Please?

631
00:26:27,618 --> 00:26:28,984
Um, sure, yeah.

632
00:26:28,986 --> 00:26:31,520
I won't leave your side
if you don't want me to.

633
00:26:31,522 --> 00:26:32,788
Oh, thank you.

634
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,089
You're such a smart,
brave man.

635
00:26:34,091 --> 00:26:36,625
I'm so lucky to have someone
like you looking after me.

636
00:26:36,627 --> 00:26:38,393
How long
have you worked here?

637
00:26:40,764 --> 00:26:43,498
Your friend better get back here
with that venom soon.

638
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,900
He's almost gone.

639
00:26:54,511 --> 00:26:56,611
Happy,

640
00:26:56,613 --> 00:26:58,180
am I getting any closer?

641
00:26:58,182 --> 00:27:00,315
All I can see are

642
00:27:00,317 --> 00:27:02,250
a bunch of turtles.

643
00:27:02,252 --> 00:27:03,852
Hang a left.

644
00:27:03,854 --> 00:27:05,854
Okay.

645
00:27:07,991 --> 00:27:09,624
Got snakes?

646
00:27:09,626 --> 00:27:12,327
Mm, yeah, getting there.

647
00:27:12,329 --> 00:27:13,329
You okay?

648
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,529
Sure.

649
00:27:14,531 --> 00:27:16,031
Are you scared of snakes?

650
00:27:16,033 --> 00:27:17,532
Oh, no.

651
00:27:17,534 --> 00:27:18,767
Walter, I've seen you
diffuse a bomb.

652
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:22,270
That risk was calculable.

653
00:27:22,272 --> 00:27:26,975
You cannot predict
what a wild animal will do.

654
00:27:26,977 --> 00:27:29,778
I'm just gonna reach down,

655
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,214
scoop up the snake
and then get out.

656
00:27:32,216 --> 00:27:33,648
Limited risk.

657
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,484
I will be fine.

658
00:27:35,486 --> 00:27:37,452
Okay, you have to make sure
you don't harm the snake

659
00:27:37,454 --> 00:27:38,487
when you retrieve it.

660
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:39,888
Do you want to change places?

661
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:42,357
- Hell no. Those things are deadly.
- Okay, kids.

662
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:44,993
If I could have everybody
at this window over here.

663
00:27:44,995 --> 00:27:47,496
If everyone stays quiet,
I can tell you about

664
00:27:47,498 --> 00:27:50,565
the over 40 breeds of venomous
snakes that we have here.

665
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:52,434
Now, many of these snakes
come from

666
00:27:52,436 --> 00:27:56,271
a tropical, wet climate,
but since SoCal is a desert,

667
00:27:56,273 --> 00:27:58,306
who would like to make
our snakes feel more at home?

668
00:27:58,308 --> 00:27:59,341
Me! Me!

669
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:01,009
You certainly look
like a snake lover.

670
00:28:01,011 --> 00:28:03,912
Press that little red button
and see what happens.

671
00:28:03,914 --> 00:28:05,480
I don't have
a good feeling about this.

672
00:28:05,482 --> 00:28:07,749
You made it rain!

673
00:28:10,287 --> 00:28:12,587
Oh! Oh! Oh!

674
00:28:12,589 --> 00:28:14,356
Let's make our way to the exit, kids.
Call security!

675
00:28:14,358 --> 00:28:15,590
Walter.

676
00:28:15,592 --> 00:28:17,359
Okay. Not good.

677
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:21,129
Oh, boy. A deadly snake.

678
00:28:34,993 --> 00:28:36,960
Walter, don't move.

679
00:28:36,962 --> 00:28:38,163
Okay.

680
00:28:38,164 --> 00:28:41,665
We need a tan snake with a
zigzag pattern along its back.

681
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:44,668
I think that's the one, the
one that's near your business.

682
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,737
Guys.

683
00:28:46,739 --> 00:28:48,172
There's a tan snake

684
00:28:48,174 --> 00:28:50,240
with a different zigzag pattern
in this tree.

685
00:28:50,242 --> 00:28:52,209
Which one do we want?

686
00:28:52,211 --> 00:28:54,712
How the hell should I
know? I'm a mechanic.

687
00:28:54,714 --> 00:28:56,880
Can we try and capture
both of them, make antidotes

688
00:28:56,882 --> 00:28:58,782
out of both venom,
see which one works?

689
00:28:58,784 --> 00:29:01,218
No. There is barely enough time
to make one antivenom.

690
00:29:03,055 --> 00:29:04,822
I have an idea.

691
00:29:04,824 --> 00:29:06,990
Uh, are you doing

692
00:29:06,992 --> 00:29:08,425
- what I think you're doing?
- What?

693
00:29:08,427 --> 00:29:09,827
Wait. Walter,
what are you doing?

694
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:11,762
Walter,

695
00:29:11,764 --> 00:29:12,996
what are you doing?!

696
00:29:12,998 --> 00:29:15,499
Process of elimination
is our most efficient

697
00:29:15,501 --> 00:29:16,834
path.

698
00:29:16,836 --> 00:29:18,068
Come on, come on, come on.

699
00:29:20,206 --> 00:29:21,605
Whoa!

700
00:29:22,608 --> 00:29:23,974
Crap.

701
00:29:27,546 --> 00:29:29,546
I think we've got
the right snake.

702
00:29:31,117 --> 00:29:33,317
Okay, move.

703
00:29:41,093 --> 00:29:42,860
Watch the snake.

704
00:29:42,862 --> 00:29:44,595
What the hell is

705
00:29:44,597 --> 00:29:46,029
the plan here?
To make an antidote,

706
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:48,232
we need a host
to inject a little bit

707
00:29:48,234 --> 00:29:50,768
of venom into, not enough to
kill it, but enough to develop

708
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,669
antibodies. There.

709
00:29:52,671 --> 00:29:54,138
That's our host.

710
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,640
Yeah.
I'm on it.

711
00:29:57,576 --> 00:29:58,642
One ferret coming up!

712
00:29:58,644 --> 00:30:00,110
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

713
00:30:07,219 --> 00:30:08,219
Yep.

714
00:30:12,324 --> 00:30:15,659
Ah! Come on!
Don't be stingy!

715
00:30:17,096 --> 00:30:19,463
Okay, I think I got enough.
Uh, yeah. I got enough.

716
00:30:19,465 --> 00:30:20,731
How are you still functioning

717
00:30:20,733 --> 00:30:23,801
while Kreshenko's
barely alive?

718
00:30:23,803 --> 00:30:25,636
Because I'm younger.

719
00:30:25,638 --> 00:30:28,071
But we have to get back
to the ranch fast. Happy.

720
00:30:28,073 --> 00:30:30,707
Hey, I'm doing 90 in a burrito
truck. Cut me some slack.

721
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:32,643
Okay, hold him still.

722
00:30:32,645 --> 00:30:34,545
Wait, is this gonna hurt him?
I'm so glad

723
00:30:34,547 --> 00:30:36,013
that you're concerned
about the ferret.

724
00:30:36,015 --> 00:30:37,681
I'm sorry.
Okay, buddy.

725
00:30:37,683 --> 00:30:40,083
Help me out here.

726
00:31:23,963 --> 00:31:25,662
Next time...

727
00:31:25,664 --> 00:31:28,332
let your horse do the thinking.

728
00:31:28,334 --> 00:31:30,067
He's smarter.

729
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,536
Freeze!

730
00:31:32,538 --> 00:31:33,504
Stop right now!

731
00:31:33,506 --> 00:31:35,706
Stop the vehicle!
Halt!

732
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:37,040
Lower your guns.

733
00:31:37,042 --> 00:31:39,309
We're the Homeland guys.
We've got an antidote.

734
00:31:42,815 --> 00:31:44,882
Okay. Come on, Walt.
We're almost there.

735
00:31:44,884 --> 00:31:46,683
Careful on those steps, Happy.

736
00:31:46,685 --> 00:31:48,352
There's taco grease!

737
00:31:48,354 --> 00:31:50,387
Oh, no.

738
00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:51,755
What did you do?

739
00:31:51,757 --> 00:31:54,057
I dropped the ferret.

740
00:32:01,643 --> 00:32:02,775
Oh, he does not look good.

741
00:32:02,777 --> 00:32:04,977
The fuel quotients for
the rockets are off.

742
00:32:04,979 --> 00:32:06,546
He's rambling.
He's delusional.

743
00:32:06,548 --> 00:32:07,747
He's in bad shape.

744
00:32:07,749 --> 00:32:09,815
Walter, what the hell
were you thinking?

745
00:32:09,817 --> 00:32:14,020
The antibodies are
in the host organism.

746
00:32:14,022 --> 00:32:15,288
What host organism?

747
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,656
I slipped on taco grease
getting out of the van,

748
00:32:16,658 --> 00:32:18,724
and when I fell, the ferret
with the venom got away.

749
00:32:18,726 --> 00:32:20,826
That's the first time
anyone has ever said that.

750
00:32:20,828 --> 00:32:22,428
I got to go help
Happy find him.

751
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,930
Paige, I'm sorry. I...

752
00:32:23,932 --> 00:32:26,132
What?

753
00:32:27,402 --> 00:32:29,835
I'm sorry.

754
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:33,272
I had reservations.

755
00:32:33,274 --> 00:32:36,142
Reservations about what?

756
00:32:36,144 --> 00:32:38,744
I-I never took you to dinner.

757
00:32:39,581 --> 00:32:41,514
Whoa, little sucker's fast.

758
00:32:44,552 --> 00:32:46,452
What am I supposed to do
with this thing?

759
00:32:46,454 --> 00:32:47,720
Oh, no. Really?

760
00:32:47,722 --> 00:32:50,556
I need
a high-speed centrifuge

761
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:53,159
to separate out the antibody
from the ferret blood.

762
00:32:53,161 --> 00:32:55,127
Yeah, Walter must've had
a plan here.

763
00:32:55,129 --> 00:32:57,163
Walter's not talking
right now, Toby.

764
00:32:57,165 --> 00:32:58,084
Okay, okay...

765
00:32:58,085 --> 00:32:59,497
They're dead men.
They're going to die.

766
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,600
Let me think, okay?

767
00:33:00,602 --> 00:33:02,335
What is there to think about?

768
00:33:02,337 --> 00:33:05,255
I'll just inject them with ferret blood,
without processing it.

769
00:33:05,256 --> 00:33:06,606
Million-to-one shot but
what choice do we have?

770
00:33:06,608 --> 00:33:08,023
No, you're not taking
a million-to-one shot

771
00:33:08,047 --> 00:33:08,976
with my friend's life,
you understand?

772
00:33:08,977 --> 00:33:10,376
You go near him
with that ferret,

773
00:33:10,378 --> 00:33:12,378
I'm gonna cram that furry
little dude up in a place

774
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,513
it can never run away from.
You follow?

775
00:33:14,515 --> 00:33:18,084
We just need to separate
the antibodies from the plasma.

776
00:33:18,086 --> 00:33:20,353
Somehow simulate
a high-speed centrifuge.

777
00:33:20,355 --> 00:33:22,755
You came here
in a taco truck, right?

778
00:33:22,757 --> 00:33:25,258
Okay.

779
00:33:29,464 --> 00:33:31,230
Oh!

780
00:33:31,232 --> 00:33:32,031
Salad spinner! Let's go.

781
00:33:32,033 --> 00:33:33,566
All right, come on!

782
00:33:45,246 --> 00:33:47,146
Okay. Now we wait.

783
00:33:47,148 --> 00:33:49,715
Even if we save
Kreshenko,

784
00:33:49,717 --> 00:33:52,251
these guys are so
distrustful of one another,

785
00:33:52,253 --> 00:33:54,553
they'll never sit
down and negotiate.

786
00:33:54,555 --> 00:33:57,156
Well, then we'll have
to figure out a way

787
00:33:57,158 --> 00:33:59,358
to motivate them
to want to.

788
00:34:10,271 --> 00:34:11,771
How'd we do?

789
00:34:11,773 --> 00:34:13,205
Walter.

790
00:34:13,207 --> 00:34:14,674
How are you feeling?

791
00:34:14,676 --> 00:34:16,842
Oh, terrible.

792
00:34:18,313 --> 00:34:21,180
But, uh, worse
now that I've seen this.

793
00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:26,419
So Kreshenko died,

794
00:34:26,421 --> 00:34:28,154
word got out,
and now we're off

795
00:34:28,156 --> 00:34:29,855
to a decade
of death and destruction?

796
00:34:29,857 --> 00:34:31,991
Not exactly.

797
00:34:36,664 --> 00:34:37,596
Are they...

798
00:34:37,598 --> 00:34:39,131
Signing a
peace treaty?

799
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:40,666
You bet they are.

800
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:42,902
We showed them what would happen
if they didn't.

801
00:34:42,904 --> 00:34:45,104
Come with me.
I'll show you.

802
00:34:50,111 --> 00:34:51,677
Gallo,

803
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,614
I know today was rough
and we went at it,

804
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:58,784
but you got the ball
into the end zone.

805
00:34:58,786 --> 00:35:01,420
I won't forget
what you did.

806
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:05,858
And you threatened to
disclose something to Walter

807
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,061
I don't ever
want shared.

808
00:35:09,063 --> 00:35:12,365
I won't forget
what you did, either.

809
00:35:16,804 --> 00:35:18,304
Both sides are set
to start pulling back

810
00:35:18,306 --> 00:35:20,339
heavy weapons on Tuesday
to create a buffer zone

811
00:35:20,341 --> 00:35:22,508
of up to 140 kilometers.

812
00:35:26,147 --> 00:35:27,947
You used my software.

813
00:35:27,949 --> 00:35:30,082
Old footage
of Lithuanian tank maneuvers

814
00:35:30,084 --> 00:35:31,517
laid over border territories

815
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:34,053
they have never
been near before.

816
00:35:34,055 --> 00:35:35,654
Soldiers disembarking tanks,

817
00:35:35,656 --> 00:35:37,423
except we put them
near the disputed boundaries.

818
00:35:37,425 --> 00:35:38,958
Images over images.

819
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,659
Like Colorforms.

820
00:35:40,661 --> 00:35:43,462
The United States and Germany
have promised ground troops

821
00:35:43,464 --> 00:35:46,665
immediately, a move the Russian
government has called

822
00:35:46,667 --> 00:35:49,101
an act
of direct aggression.

823
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:51,437
She's using my voice dubbing software.
No.

824
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:53,539
Actually, the British accent's
Happy's real voice.

825
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:55,441
She's been lying to us
the whole time.

826
00:35:55,443 --> 00:35:57,877
We just spliced the
wiring of our broadcast

827
00:35:57,879 --> 00:35:59,912
to the satellite dish on the
roof, so now everybody thinks

828
00:35:59,914 --> 00:36:01,380
they're watching the real news.

829
00:36:01,382 --> 00:36:03,416
That is fantastic work, guys.

830
00:36:03,418 --> 00:36:04,750
Just call us

831
00:36:04,752 --> 00:36:06,218
the Ghosts of Christmas Future.

832
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,120
We scared the hell out of them.

833
00:36:08,122 --> 00:36:09,789
They ran
to the bargaining table.

834
00:36:09,791 --> 00:36:13,526
So, uh, what happens when they
get back and find out the truth?

835
00:36:13,528 --> 00:36:15,327
What are they gonna say?
That a bunch of schmucks

836
00:36:15,329 --> 00:36:17,029
who work out of a garage
outsmarted them?

837
00:36:17,031 --> 00:36:19,632
Those guys want
to get re-elected.

838
00:36:23,404 --> 00:36:26,172
♪ ♪

839
00:36:40,922 --> 00:36:43,022
Where is it?

840
00:36:43,024 --> 00:36:44,657
Doc.

841
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:46,759
Come here a minute.

842
00:36:48,596 --> 00:36:50,463
What's up?

843
00:37:01,976 --> 00:37:04,944
When you grabbed that doctor
and put him in his place,

844
00:37:04,946 --> 00:37:07,279
it was hot.

845
00:37:07,281 --> 00:37:08,247
Um...

846
00:37:08,249 --> 00:37:10,516
thank you for that...

847
00:37:10,518 --> 00:37:11,884
Shh.

848
00:37:11,886 --> 00:37:14,687
Just don't talk.

849
00:37:14,689 --> 00:37:16,655
Don't ruin it.

850
00:37:16,657 --> 00:37:18,257
Okay.

851
00:37:19,093 --> 00:37:21,293
Okay.

852
00:37:31,372 --> 00:37:34,340
Why's it smell like seawater?

853
00:37:34,342 --> 00:37:37,843
I formulated, uh,
an electrolyte solution.

854
00:37:37,845 --> 00:37:40,479
It's more efficient
than the market brands.

855
00:37:40,481 --> 00:37:42,615
It tastes, um...

856
00:37:42,617 --> 00:37:44,950
disgusting.

857
00:37:44,952 --> 00:37:46,752
Taking that bite today

858
00:37:46,754 --> 00:37:48,053
was crazy.

859
00:37:48,055 --> 00:37:50,689
I know we go down a lot of
dicey roads, but that was...

860
00:37:50,691 --> 00:37:52,057
It was necessary.

861
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:53,659
War was imminent.

862
00:37:53,661 --> 00:37:55,661
Still, I don't like you taking
that kind of risk.

863
00:37:55,663 --> 00:37:58,364
Noted.

864
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,408
You look like you're going
to say something.

865
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,913
You kept it?

866
00:38:13,915 --> 00:38:15,147
He saved my life.

867
00:38:15,149 --> 00:38:17,583
Least I could do
is save it from becoming a...

868
00:38:17,585 --> 00:38:19,585
snake's lunch.

869
00:38:19,587 --> 00:38:21,654
Toby named it Ferret Bueller.

870
00:38:21,656 --> 00:38:23,956
I don't understand
the reference.

871
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:26,559
I need my
history textbook.

872
00:38:26,561 --> 00:38:27,561
I'm already late
as hell!

873
00:38:27,562 --> 00:38:28,928
And I don't understand

874
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:31,263
why she didn't tell me
she was taking a night class.

875
00:38:31,265 --> 00:38:32,665
You, this group,

876
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:34,433
it's a lot to compete
with academically.

877
00:38:34,435 --> 00:38:37,403
She knows
there's no reason to compete.

878
00:38:37,405 --> 00:38:39,338
And that
she can't compete.

879
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,540
Just like we can't compete
with her

880
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:43,509
in so many regards.

881
00:38:43,511 --> 00:38:47,413
So... why keep
that hidden?

882
00:38:47,415 --> 00:38:51,016
There's a million reasons
why people keep secrets.

883
00:38:52,753 --> 00:38:54,920
Sometimes we just
can't understand.

884
00:38:54,922 --> 00:38:57,456
No! No, no!

885
00:38:57,458 --> 00:38:58,691
What's the problem?

886
00:38:58,693 --> 00:39:00,960
Busted water main on Sunset.
Traffic's gridlocked.

887
00:39:00,962 --> 00:39:02,995
There's no way
I'll make my final.

888
00:39:02,997 --> 00:39:04,463
I'm gonna flunk.

889
00:39:04,465 --> 00:39:06,632
I need a favor.

890
00:39:13,574 --> 00:39:15,674
<i>Oh, my God, I made it.</i>

891
00:39:15,676 --> 00:39:17,476
This is amazing.

892
00:39:17,478 --> 00:39:19,311
Seven minutes to spare.

893
00:39:20,615 --> 00:39:22,915
I-I didn't have a chance
to cram today.

894
00:39:22,917 --> 00:39:25,684
I know you think this stuff
is nonsense, but...

895
00:39:25,686 --> 00:39:27,786
I'm nervous.

896
00:39:27,788 --> 00:39:29,588
You outshined and impressed

897
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:32,091
a seasoned
diplomatic envoy today.

898
00:39:32,093 --> 00:39:34,927
So if you can do that,
you can crush the test.

899
00:39:37,164 --> 00:39:39,431
I'm proud of you.

900
00:39:39,433 --> 00:39:42,334
Thank you, Walter.
