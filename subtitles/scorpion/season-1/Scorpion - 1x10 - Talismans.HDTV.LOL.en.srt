<i>My name is Walter O'Brien.</i>

3
00:00:06,987 --> 00:00:11,390
<i>I have the fourth highest
IQ ever recorded: 197.</i>

4
00:00:11,392 --> 00:00:13,158
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,661
<i>When I was 11, the FBI
arrested me for hacking NASA</i>

6
00:00:15,663 --> 00:00:18,430
<i>to get their blueprints</i> <i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

7
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,599
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

8
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:22,067
<i>tackling worldwide threats</i>

9
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:23,635
<i>only we can solve.</i>

10
00:00:23,637 --> 00:00:25,337
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

11
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:27,105
<i>Sylvester's a human calculator.</i>

12
00:00:27,107 --> 00:00:29,474
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

13
00:00:29,476 --> 00:00:31,677
<i>Agent Cabe Gallo's</i> <i>our government handler.</i>

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,912
<i>And Paige?</i> <i>Well, Paige isn't like us.</i>

15
00:00:33,914 --> 00:00:36,315
<i>She's normal</i> <i>and translates the world for us</i>

16
00:00:36,317 --> 00:00:39,017
<i>while we help her understand</i> <i>her genius son.</i>

17
00:00:39,019 --> 00:00:41,119
<i>Together, we are Scorpion.</i>

18
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:44,056
<i>You should have
seen the handful we were</i>

19
00:00:44,058 --> 00:00:46,024
dealing with at the scene,
like open container violation,

20
00:00:46,026 --> 00:00:49,561
drunk and disorderly, resisting arrest.

21
00:00:49,563 --> 00:00:52,564
Resisting arrest? Yep.
We're not pressing charges

22
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:54,333
because of the unique circumstances,

23
00:00:54,335 --> 00:00:55,667
but next time,

24
00:00:55,669 --> 00:00:59,071
we don't go easy. Okay. Thank you.

25
00:00:59,073 --> 00:01:01,840
What up, little bro?

26
00:01:01,842 --> 00:01:03,442
Resisting arrest?

27
00:01:03,444 --> 00:01:05,610
I'm half crippled-- I fell into the cop

28
00:01:05,612 --> 00:01:08,280
as he was lifting me out of the sand.

29
00:01:08,282 --> 00:01:09,881
That's resisting<i> gravity.</i>

30
00:01:09,883 --> 00:01:11,183
That's not funny.

31
00:01:11,185 --> 00:01:13,652
No, what's not funny is that I have to spend

32
00:01:13,654 --> 00:01:17,356
every last minute of my very
short life span in a hospital...

33
00:01:17,358 --> 00:01:20,892
hospital smell, hospital people,
hospital food...

34
00:01:21,762 --> 00:01:24,196
so... I bailed,

35
00:01:24,198 --> 00:01:26,298
and... I got a six-pack.

36
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,200
Alcohol. That's, wonderful.

37
00:01:28,202 --> 00:01:30,335
- Can we...? 
- What? Don't take me back yet.

38
00:01:30,337 --> 00:01:32,270
I barely get to see you.

39
00:01:32,272 --> 00:01:34,139
Megan, I visit every Friday.

40
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:35,674
Walter, the docs said

41
00:01:35,676 --> 00:01:38,276
in less than a year I won't be able to walk.

42
00:01:38,278 --> 00:01:39,444
My respiratory system will

43
00:01:39,446 --> 00:01:41,813
soon follow. Nothing is certain.
MS is fickle.

44
00:01:41,815 --> 00:01:43,215
<i>Life</i> is fickle.

45
00:01:43,217 --> 00:01:45,684
But I want to live while I still can.

46
00:01:45,686 --> 00:01:47,419
Come on, let me spend the day with you.

47
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:50,188
- No. No. Okay, get in the car.
- See your work, meet your coworkers.

48
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,757
Come on.

49
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,291
It's not a good idea.

50
00:01:53,293 --> 00:01:56,461
One day,
and then I'll go back to my PT and tests.

51
00:01:56,463 --> 00:01:58,163
Besides...

52
00:01:58,165 --> 00:01:59,664
if you take me to the hospital,

53
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,933
you're just gonna have to bail me out again.

54
00:02:04,138 --> 00:02:05,303
Are you guys ready?

55
00:02:05,305 --> 00:02:07,305
Hold your horses.

56
00:02:07,307 --> 00:02:08,874
All right, Sly, we're done.

57
00:02:08,876 --> 00:02:10,575
Okay.

58
00:02:10,577 --> 00:02:13,011
All right,
that mug had 23 clothespins on it,

59
00:02:13,013 --> 00:02:14,279
which means you took two.

60
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:15,647
These erasers aren't level,

61
00:02:15,649 --> 00:02:17,649
which means you broke a pencil tip.

62
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:19,451
Come on, guys, not cool. And...

63
00:02:19,453 --> 00:02:20,453
you moved that notebook

64
00:02:20,454 --> 00:02:22,487
- one-sixteenth of an inch. 
- Damn it.

65
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:24,222
Have fun writing my case studies...

66
00:02:24,224 --> 00:02:25,690
"Suckas."

67
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:28,660
Get your homework in on time.

68
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,164
Happy.

69
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:33,899
You know,
I would expect this kind of behavior

70
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:35,233
from Toby, but...

71
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:39,271
Hey.

72
00:02:39,273 --> 00:02:41,139
So, um,

73
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:42,574
this is my sister Megan.

74
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:43,975
Hi.

75
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,346
Thought you guys were geniuses.

76
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:50,148
Someone say something smart.

77
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,450
Hi, Megan. I'm so sorry.

78
00:02:51,452 --> 00:02:52,651
I'm Paige.

79
00:02:52,653 --> 00:02:53,718
They were just...

80
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,954
playing a spirited game of...

81
00:02:55,956 --> 00:02:57,722
"Move Sylvester's Stuff Around."

82
00:02:57,724 --> 00:03:00,192
Yeah... so they're a little out of it.

83
00:03:01,762 --> 00:03:03,328
Guys, this is when you introduce yourself.

84
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,663
Yes, okay.

85
00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:06,231
Hello, Megan.

86
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:07,966
Nice to meet you.

87
00:03:07,968 --> 00:03:09,234
Walter has told me so much about you.

88
00:03:09,236 --> 00:03:11,036
No, he hasn't.

89
00:03:11,038 --> 00:03:12,571
No, he hasn't. Hey.

90
00:03:12,573 --> 00:03:14,539
Dr. Tobias M. Curtis.

91
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:15,941
It's a pleasure.

92
00:03:15,943 --> 00:03:17,809
Hey, I'm Happy.

93
00:03:17,811 --> 00:03:20,178
And I'm dying,
but you don't see me telling everyone.

94
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,447
Yes!

95
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:24,916
Inappropriate self-deprecating
humor to put others at ease.

96
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:26,151
I like your approach.

97
00:03:26,153 --> 00:03:27,619
I like your hat.

98
00:03:30,424 --> 00:03:32,591
Can I sit? Yeah, yeah.

99
00:03:32,593 --> 00:03:34,793
Yeah, um...

100
00:03:37,464 --> 00:03:38,597
Big step for you.

101
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,665
Bringing your sister here.

102
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:42,734
You want titanium.

103
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:44,336
These are aluminum.

104
00:03:44,338 --> 00:03:45,737
The docs gave you garbage.

105
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:48,073
Well, I sure wouldn't want to have MS.

106
00:03:48,075 --> 00:03:49,975
Gosh.

107
00:03:49,977 --> 00:03:52,777
Did I let my inside voice get out again?

108
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:55,080
Yeah, Cabe?

109
00:03:55,082 --> 00:03:56,781
Yeah, we're all on our way.

110
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:01,353
Sylvester, you got my bag?

111
00:04:01,355 --> 00:04:03,388
Yeah. Are you gonna be okay here?

112
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,690
Because we have to go ASAP.
I don't have time to take you

113
00:04:05,692 --> 00:04:07,425
- back to the hospital. 
- I'll manage.

114
00:04:09,163 --> 00:04:10,228
General.

115
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,364
Is this your team? It is, sir.

116
00:04:12,366 --> 00:04:14,699
Perspiration, pupil dilation.

117
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:16,768
Fight-or-flight responses.
Something is certainly up.

118
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,603
All right,
what you're about to hear is classified.

119
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:21,573
If shared outside these walls,
it's capital treason.

120
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:22,941
Now, 60 minutes ago,

121
00:04:22,943 --> 00:04:25,343
an F-120 Hawkwing carrying

122
00:04:25,345 --> 00:04:26,912
classified radar cloaking technology

123
00:04:26,914 --> 00:04:27,914
went down in Bosnia.

124
00:04:27,915 --> 00:04:30,148
Bosnia, is that still a thing?

125
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,284
Yes, it's a thing. They're also facing

126
00:04:32,286 --> 00:04:33,752
a violent rebel faction
that wants to overthrow

127
00:04:33,754 --> 00:04:35,187
a legitimately elected government.

128
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:37,122
Violent rebels?

129
00:04:37,124 --> 00:04:39,858
The fear is they find
the plane before we do,

130
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,561
sell its cloaking software
to the highest bidder.

131
00:04:42,563 --> 00:04:44,996
If the buyers can get
past the encryption code,

132
00:04:44,998 --> 00:04:47,365
U.S. security would be
immediately threatened.

133
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:48,900
Now, separatist clashes and rebels

134
00:04:48,902 --> 00:04:51,436
have been isolated to the
southern part of the country.

135
00:04:51,438 --> 00:04:53,205
It's nowhere near the crash site.

136
00:04:53,207 --> 00:04:54,639
So you should be safe.

137
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:56,308
Go in, get the software, get out.

138
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,809
Why us? We need a team

139
00:04:57,811 --> 00:05:00,445
with the acumen to extract
technology from hardware

140
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:02,847
that may be damaged beyond repair.

141
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:04,182
So it's a straightforward mission.

142
00:05:04,184 --> 00:05:06,818
If it's so straightforward,
why do we need GI Joe here?

143
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,055
It's Lieutenant... James Corbett.

144
00:05:10,057 --> 00:05:11,523
My mistake, GI Jim.

145
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:13,024
The Hawkwing was piloted

146
00:05:13,026 --> 00:05:14,659
by Captain Javier Barrios.

147
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:17,095
We're here to escort your
team to the crash site,

148
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:18,797
oversee the software extraction,

149
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:22,567
and bring Captain Barrios's
remains home to his next of kin.

150
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:23,868
Just so we're clear,

151
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,471
for our safety, you'll do exactly

152
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:29,307
what my team says, when we say it.

153
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:31,977
Actually, we're a team, too,
and a pretty smart one,

154
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:35,146
and we don't work well when
told to follow blindly.

155
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:36,548
Then get better at it.

156
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,882
What is this guy's problem?

157
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:39,618
All right, everyone take it easy.

158
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,686
Okay, um, a moment, please...

159
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:45,957
Take a step back instead of forward on this.

160
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,559
Well, he's hostile and condescending, so...

161
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:51,505
Well, maybe because a fellow 
member of the military is dead,

162
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:53,298
and they have to go find the corpse.

163
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,499
So, before you say something

164
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:55,767
you can't take back,

165
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:56,868
think...

166
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,902
"What would Paige say?"

167
00:05:59,473 --> 00:06:01,072
Hi.

168
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:03,675
I'm sorry...

169
00:06:03,677 --> 00:06:06,077
we're ready to help, however we can.

170
00:06:09,216 --> 00:06:10,715
You need me on this one,

171
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:12,183
'cause you're going to either be

172
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:13,551
defending our team from the SEALs

173
00:06:13,553 --> 00:06:15,020
or trying to kill them yourself.

174
00:06:15,022 --> 00:06:16,421
I can calm the waters.

175
00:06:16,423 --> 00:06:18,857
You're okay with going to
another country for 36 hours,

176
00:06:18,859 --> 00:06:20,191
leaving your kid behind?

177
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:21,660
I'll call Drew; he'll watch Ralph.

178
00:06:21,662 --> 00:06:23,795
I can handle this. I'm part of the team.

179
00:06:23,797 --> 00:06:25,196
Part of it?

180
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:27,499
You're the glue, kid.

181
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:29,801
Walter, you know,

182
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:32,404
the military's only gonna get
you a 20 square mile radius

183
00:06:32,406 --> 00:06:34,139
on the location of that jet,

184
00:06:34,141 --> 00:06:35,373
but if I have all the specs,

185
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,075
I can get you a location for that plane

186
00:06:37,077 --> 00:06:39,678
in your phone by the time you land

187
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,012
within 300 yards.

188
00:06:41,014 --> 00:06:42,914
Great. I need to do it from the garage.

189
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,916
I want to make some phone calls,
I want to get

190
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:46,584
into some old theorem binders.

191
00:06:46,586 --> 00:06:48,787
I want to get this right.

192
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:50,221
That's a good idea, yeah.

193
00:06:50,223 --> 00:06:51,890
Okay.

194
00:06:51,892 --> 00:06:53,758
Um, you know, can you do me a favor?

195
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,861
Can you keep a close eye on Megan for me?

196
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:58,763
She, she won't let you

197
00:06:58,765 --> 00:07:00,231
take her back to the hospital.

198
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:01,333
She's stubborn.

199
00:07:01,335 --> 00:07:02,701
Sure, yeah.

200
00:07:02,703 --> 00:07:03,735
I'll do that.

201
00:07:03,737 --> 00:07:06,304
Okay. Thank you.

202
00:07:06,306 --> 00:07:08,073
Are you the people

203
00:07:08,075 --> 00:07:10,208
who are going to bring
my husband's body back?

204
00:07:15,682 --> 00:07:17,248
Th...

205
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,883
This team will do all it can.

206
00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:21,419
When you find him,

207
00:07:21,421 --> 00:07:23,488
please remove his necklace

208
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,723
and keep it safe.

209
00:07:24,725 --> 00:07:26,791
He wanted to pass it down to his son.

210
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:31,496
And put this in his pocket...

211
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:35,633
...so we can help guide him home.

212
00:07:36,436 --> 00:07:39,137
Sure.

213
00:07:48,815 --> 00:07:49,981
Hi.

214
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:51,116
Your brother found that

215
00:07:51,118 --> 00:07:53,551
in a junkyard and he restored it.

216
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:55,687
I don't think he'd
appreciate the extra flair.

217
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:57,222
And you should probably come down.

218
00:07:57,224 --> 00:07:58,490
Hey, speaking of Walter...

219
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:01,092
He called and filled me in.

220
00:08:01,094 --> 00:08:02,427
Bosnia?

221
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:03,762
That's pretty crazy.

222
00:08:03,764 --> 00:08:05,697
Yes, it is.

223
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:08,333
And do you guys always
handle such heavy-duty stuff?

224
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:11,102
Unfortunately.
Look, Megan, I'd love to speak to you,

225
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:12,303
but I need to locate a 70-foot-long plane

226
00:08:12,305 --> 00:08:15,039
in 300 square miles of wilderness.

227
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,408
So...

228
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,042
Here.

229
00:08:18,044 --> 00:08:19,277
You can play solitaire.

230
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,413
Odds of winning are 13%.

231
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:22,914
Good luck.

232
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:25,316
Have fun.

233
00:08:58,685 --> 00:09:00,518
What's with the armament?

234
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,321
I thought this wasn't hostile territory.

235
00:09:03,323 --> 00:09:05,323
We're breaching an area
with confirmed unfriendlies.

236
00:09:05,325 --> 00:09:06,391
We go prepared.

237
00:09:06,393 --> 00:09:08,226
You said "we,"

238
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:10,462
but<i> we</i> don't have weapons.

239
00:09:10,464 --> 00:09:12,430
You don't.

240
00:09:15,035 --> 00:09:16,701
Not good.

241
00:09:30,016 --> 00:09:32,116
I know we have to be covert,

242
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:33,618
but maybe we don't hit every pothole,

243
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,653
if you gave the lights a soft tap.

244
00:09:35,655 --> 00:09:37,155
We navigate by moonlight.

245
00:09:37,157 --> 00:09:38,923
It's safer.

246
00:09:42,496 --> 00:09:45,530
Now, according
to Sylvester's SMS, we head

247
00:09:45,532 --> 00:09:47,532
another three miles, veer northwest,

248
00:09:47,534 --> 00:09:49,501
and the plane will be seven miles ahead.

249
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:03,915
Blown tire.

250
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:06,050
No spares. Nice road your guy

251
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:07,085
sent us on.

252
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:08,953
I hope this doesn't slow us down.

253
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:12,223
I recognize the emotions involved,

254
00:10:12,225 --> 00:10:14,626
but, tokens, talismans,

255
00:10:14,628 --> 00:10:15,894
there's no logic to it.

256
00:10:15,896 --> 00:10:17,328
It's a sign of weakness.

257
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,430
No, it's a sign of humanity.

258
00:10:19,432 --> 00:10:20,932
- Yeah, exactly.
- This is stupid.

259
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:23,735
I'm sure I can temp-patch this thing.

260
00:10:23,737 --> 00:10:26,471
Hey, what the hell do you think
you're doing? Extinguish that...

261
00:10:26,473 --> 00:10:29,007
Fall back!

262
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:31,209
Take cover! Go, go, go, go, go!

263
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:38,182
Stay down, stay down, stay down, stay down!

264
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:51,437
Stay down!
Stay down!

265
00:10:55,576 --> 00:10:57,442
We'll run between fire gaps,
deep into the woods,

266
00:10:57,444 --> 00:10:59,311
- there's more coverage.
-  I'd prefer not to.

267
00:11:00,581 --> 00:11:01,880
Now!

268
00:11:06,978 --> 00:11:09,178
I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die!

269
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:10,345
Look at me, look at me.

270
00:11:10,347 --> 00:11:12,180
- We will get out of this. 
- How?

271
00:11:12,182 --> 00:11:13,282
Rebels got us pinned. Any ideas?

272
00:11:13,284 --> 00:11:17,052
Yeah. When it gets bright, run.

273
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:22,257
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Let's go, let's go!

274
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:24,293
- This just got serious! 
- Don't look, just run!

275
00:11:32,603 --> 00:11:35,671
My pancreas.

276
00:11:37,474 --> 00:11:39,041
You okay?

277
00:11:39,043 --> 00:11:40,509
I'm peachy.

278
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,315
All right, hey, stop here. Stop.

279
00:11:50,888 --> 00:11:52,587
Where's Happy and Toby?

280
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:54,756
You are not lighting up that
phone's display out here.

281
00:11:54,758 --> 00:11:56,091
Two of my team are missing...

282
00:11:56,093 --> 00:11:58,193
I'm calling them.

283
00:12:04,668 --> 00:12:06,101
Walt?

284
00:12:06,103 --> 00:12:07,836
- Happy, where are you? 
- I have no idea.

285
00:12:07,838 --> 00:12:10,505
Toby and I fell down the side of a ravine.

286
00:12:10,507 --> 00:12:11,973
Looking up at a 300-foot cliff.

287
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:14,142
We also lost our food and
water during the fall.

288
00:12:14,144 --> 00:12:15,277
And my hat.

289
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,713
Hey, check your map. We need to locate them.

290
00:12:17,715 --> 00:12:19,881
The map's in the truck.
Along with our rapelling gear.

291
00:12:19,883 --> 00:12:21,550
There's no way we can risk going back, so...

292
00:12:21,552 --> 00:12:23,852
their only option's to hold
tight until conditions change.

293
00:12:23,854 --> 00:12:25,354
- We need to move. 
- Those rebels

294
00:12:25,356 --> 00:12:26,855
are gonna regroup and be on us in no time.

295
00:12:26,857 --> 00:12:28,957
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait.

296
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,393
Sylvester! Cabe, I'm gonna call him.

297
00:12:31,395 --> 00:12:32,427
That nervous kid?

298
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:33,895
We can count on him.

299
00:12:35,032 --> 00:12:37,332
He's a professional.

300
00:12:37,334 --> 00:12:39,601
Ooh, and chopped nuts!

301
00:12:39,603 --> 00:12:41,236
You're chopping my nuts.

302
00:12:41,238 --> 00:12:43,271
My God!

303
00:12:43,273 --> 00:12:45,941
You're the best.

304
00:12:47,344 --> 00:12:49,444
This is so good!

305
00:12:49,446 --> 00:12:51,713
Okay.

306
00:12:51,715 --> 00:12:52,848
- Hello?
- Sylvester?

307
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:53,915
Walter!

308
00:12:53,917 --> 00:12:55,183
We got a problem.

309
00:12:55,185 --> 00:12:57,052
- we lost Happy and Toby.
- They're lost.

310
00:12:57,054 --> 00:12:58,320
Are you sure?!

311
00:12:58,322 --> 00:12:59,821
Yeah, no, I'm pretty sure
I would notice them

312
00:12:59,823 --> 00:13:00,989
if they were here, so

313
00:13:00,991 --> 00:13:02,891
we gonna need high-def sat images

314
00:13:02,893 --> 00:13:05,794
of the area to pinpoint their location

315
00:13:05,796 --> 00:13:07,929
at around a 10-mile radius

316
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:09,931
with a latitude of 44

317
00:13:09,933 --> 00:13:11,099
and a longitude of 18.

318
00:13:11,101 --> 00:13:13,168
Okay. Walter, is everything okay?

319
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,302
Yeah, just a...

320
00:13:14,304 --> 00:13:15,370
a little hiccup. Um...

321
00:13:15,372 --> 00:13:16,605
- you okay? 
- Yeah, I'm fine.

322
00:13:16,607 --> 00:13:18,707
Forget about me. You're lost in Bosnia.

323
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:21,510
Okay. Walter, I got it!
There should be a cliff or

324
00:13:21,512 --> 00:13:23,712
- a ravine they fell down.
- Yes.

325
00:13:23,714 --> 00:13:24,714
I see it.

326
00:13:24,715 --> 00:13:26,281
Okay, in about six miles,

327
00:13:26,283 --> 00:13:28,350
the plateau you're on and
the ravine will converge.

328
00:13:28,352 --> 00:13:30,585
After that, it's just woods, it's desolate.

329
00:13:30,587 --> 00:13:32,154
But you can meet up there.

330
00:13:32,156 --> 00:13:33,355
You guys hear that?

331
00:13:33,357 --> 00:13:35,290
Yeah, and we don't like it.

332
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:36,491
We get lost out here,

333
00:13:36,493 --> 00:13:38,493
we're dead in three days without water.

334
00:13:38,495 --> 00:13:39,628
You listen up.

335
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,762
You have no options.

336
00:13:40,764 --> 00:13:42,764
Now, tough it up and be smart.

337
00:13:42,766 --> 00:13:45,167
Keep your head down,
and stay out of open spaces when you can.

338
00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:47,436
And don't use your phone unless
it's absolutely necessary.

339
00:13:47,438 --> 00:13:48,470
It might give you away.

340
00:13:48,472 --> 00:13:49,805
Roger that. And Toby...

341
00:13:49,807 --> 00:13:50,872
Yes?

342
00:13:50,874 --> 00:13:52,140
Happy's in charge.

343
00:13:52,142 --> 00:13:53,375
What...?

344
00:13:53,377 --> 00:13:55,544
We better get going.

345
00:13:59,983 --> 00:14:01,049
I should look at that.

346
00:14:01,051 --> 00:14:03,118
Who's in charge?

347
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,252
You are.

348
00:14:04,254 --> 00:14:05,821
Got an issue over here.

349
00:14:08,992 --> 00:14:10,158
You were hit?

350
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,226
Yeah, didn't realize it

351
00:14:11,228 --> 00:14:13,128
till the adrenaline started to wear off.

352
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,963
Clean it, dress it.

353
00:14:14,965 --> 00:14:16,331
Then we're Oscar Mike.

354
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,999
We got to get to the plane
before the rebels get to us.

355
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:20,202
Roger that.

356
00:14:21,138 --> 00:14:23,038
- This is you... 
- Hey!

357
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,072
and your team's fault.
Hey, give me that phone.

358
00:14:24,074 --> 00:14:25,173
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! 
- Stand down.

359
00:14:25,175 --> 00:14:27,075
I know you're hot. Take a breath.

360
00:14:27,077 --> 00:14:30,512
No. You'll get this back
when we're on our way home.

361
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:36,127
It was your truck from your
contact that broke down.

362
00:14:36,153 --> 00:14:38,453
The only protocol that's
worked so far on this mission

363
00:14:38,455 --> 00:14:39,488
are the sat phones...

364
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,822
technology designed by someone

365
00:14:40,824 --> 00:14:43,024
who's a lot more like me than you!

366
00:14:43,026 --> 00:14:45,994
Guys,
we all have people we're worried about.

367
00:14:45,996 --> 00:14:47,195
Including...

368
00:14:47,197 --> 00:14:48,497
this woman and child.

369
00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:50,131
This is why we're here.

370
00:14:51,502 --> 00:14:55,003
This is what's worth fighting for.

371
00:14:56,206 --> 00:14:58,673
Copy that. Right.

372
00:15:02,746 --> 00:15:06,014
Sylvester, you look like you're
gonna have a heart attack.

373
00:15:06,016 --> 00:15:07,582
I'm trying to hack Bosnia's
Ministry of the Interior

374
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:10,452
to see if they have any
Intel on rebel positions.

375
00:15:10,454 --> 00:15:12,187
But it's gonna take me a while.

376
00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:13,622
Especially if this decryption software

377
00:15:13,624 --> 00:15:15,657
won't download. Ten minutes? Come on!

378
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:17,526
Ten minutes? Okay.

379
00:15:17,528 --> 00:15:18,593
You need a break.

380
00:15:18,595 --> 00:15:21,329
I thought you can tell me about this.

381
00:15:21,331 --> 00:15:24,366
I found it in Walter's room.

382
00:15:26,036 --> 00:15:28,303
When I was 12,

383
00:15:28,305 --> 00:15:29,771
I lost this.

384
00:15:29,773 --> 00:15:32,541
I looked everywhere for it.

385
00:15:32,543 --> 00:15:34,442
Walter even helped.

386
00:15:34,444 --> 00:15:36,578
Any idea why he has it?

387
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,747
No. Walter's a private person.

388
00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:40,849
Well, how about this?

389
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:43,785
The Coronet Room?

390
00:15:43,787 --> 00:15:45,287
That's the sleazy casino

391
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:47,122
Toby used to hustle in.

392
00:15:47,124 --> 00:15:48,356
That's where Walter met him.

393
00:15:48,358 --> 00:15:49,524
My brother doesn't gamble.

394
00:15:49,526 --> 00:15:50,692
No, but

395
00:15:50,694 --> 00:15:52,460
when he was raising
capital to start Scorpion,

396
00:15:52,462 --> 00:15:54,262
he'd get staked by high rollers

397
00:15:54,264 --> 00:15:56,331
and he'd clean out poker rooms for a cut.

398
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,632
That's where he met Toby

399
00:15:57,634 --> 00:15:59,868
about to get his butt kicked by a pit boss.

400
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,804
So Walter intervened and
worked off all of Toby's debt.

401
00:16:02,806 --> 00:16:04,205
Really?

402
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:10,312
How about this motel key?

403
00:16:11,548 --> 00:16:14,082
I don't want to talk about that.

404
00:16:15,752 --> 00:16:18,019
I have to get back to work.

405
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:21,489
There's the plane.

406
00:16:21,491 --> 00:16:24,326
My God, burnt to a crisp.

407
00:16:25,596 --> 00:16:27,729
Where's the pilot's body?

408
00:16:27,731 --> 00:16:30,565
He was trapped in a metal
box at 1,400 degrees.

409
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:32,033
He was incinerated.

410
00:16:32,035 --> 00:16:33,835
Paige, what are you doing?

411
00:16:33,837 --> 00:16:36,104
I'm finding the necklace.

412
00:16:36,106 --> 00:16:38,974
I'm bringing it back to his son.

413
00:16:38,976 --> 00:16:40,041
It's just jewelry.

414
00:16:40,043 --> 00:16:42,110
It's more than that.

415
00:16:45,148 --> 00:16:47,749
Paige...

416
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:49,417
it's melted. It's gone.

417
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:51,486
I'm sorry.

418
00:16:53,323 --> 00:16:54,823
Okay.

419
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:56,458
Just recover the cloaking
software we came for.

420
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,627
We'll hump it back to the plane.

421
00:17:01,131 --> 00:17:03,164
He had a son.

422
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,734
I just want to finish the
job and go home, Cabe.

423
00:17:05,736 --> 00:17:07,936
Hold on, hold on!

424
00:17:07,938 --> 00:17:09,304
This hardware's three years old.

425
00:17:09,306 --> 00:17:11,139
There's no way it would be in
a state-of-the-art aircraft.

426
00:17:11,141 --> 00:17:13,074
What are you saying-- they swapped it?

427
00:17:13,076 --> 00:17:14,509
It was planted.

428
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:16,678
It was made to look like it
was destroyed in the fire,

429
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,847
which was deliberately set.

430
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:20,615
The software's already been stolen.

431
00:17:20,617 --> 00:17:22,450
That's not the only thing taken.

432
00:17:22,452 --> 00:17:23,585
There's blood here,

433
00:17:23,587 --> 00:17:25,453
a good 12 feet from the plane.

434
00:17:25,455 --> 00:17:26,855
There's no way that body leaves that plane

435
00:17:26,857 --> 00:17:29,157
unless he survived the crash.

436
00:17:31,328 --> 00:17:32,727
He's right.

437
00:17:32,729 --> 00:17:34,295
Barrios is alive.

438
00:17:35,132 --> 00:17:37,332
Rebels saw the plane fall,

439
00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:40,535
tracked it, took our pilot.
God knows what they're doing

440
00:17:40,537 --> 00:17:42,971
to him to get the encryption
code for that software.

441
00:17:42,973 --> 00:17:44,639
Okay, we have to track down that software.

442
00:17:44,641 --> 00:17:46,541
I think you mean Captain Barrios?

443
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:48,643
They're both together. You know what I mean.

444
00:17:48,645 --> 00:17:50,278
All right, listen up.

445
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,214
Here on in, we work together.

446
00:17:53,216 --> 00:17:55,750
This is no longer a simple extraction.

447
00:17:55,752 --> 00:17:59,654
Our recovery mission is
now a rescue offensive.

448
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:05,460
Now, get your game face on...

449
00:18:05,462 --> 00:18:08,830
because we're not leaving this
country without our pilot.

450
00:18:20,555 --> 00:18:22,455
Let us try again.

451
00:18:22,457 --> 00:18:24,257
What is encryption code?

452
00:18:26,428 --> 00:18:27,927
Captain Javier Barrios.

453
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:29,128
Service Number...

454
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,902
Hey, hey, hey.

455
00:18:35,904 --> 00:18:37,136
I know your name.

456
00:18:37,138 --> 00:18:38,638
I know your rank.

457
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,773
I know your service number.

458
00:18:40,775 --> 00:18:42,175
I also know date in which you die

459
00:18:42,177 --> 00:18:44,677
if you do not cooperate.

460
00:18:48,817 --> 00:18:51,084
Little baton?

461
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:56,422
He's got people shot, people missing,

462
00:18:56,424 --> 00:18:58,224
and he can still focus on his work.

463
00:18:58,226 --> 00:19:01,227
It worries me I no longer
find this abnormal.

464
00:19:01,229 --> 00:19:03,696
With Walter, abnormal is normal.

465
00:19:03,698 --> 00:19:06,265
Okay, so according
to the black box data,

466
00:19:06,267 --> 00:19:09,302
this plane thought it was
over Sarajevo when it crashed.

467
00:19:09,304 --> 00:19:10,636
Meaning what?

468
00:19:10,638 --> 00:19:11,671
Meaning mechanical failure

469
00:19:11,673 --> 00:19:13,005
didn't bring this plane down.

470
00:19:13,007 --> 00:19:14,073
It was hacked.

471
00:19:14,075 --> 00:19:16,275
The navigation coordinates were corrupted.

472
00:19:16,277 --> 00:19:19,512
And that's why the black box
couldn't send its ping signal.

473
00:19:19,514 --> 00:19:21,747
The rebels were aware
of the routine recon flights.

474
00:19:21,749 --> 00:19:24,016
They just waited for a plane to
pass over and made their move.

475
00:19:24,018 --> 00:19:25,685
Yeah.

476
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:27,653
To hack the plane's defenses,

477
00:19:27,655 --> 00:19:29,722
they'd need to be at an elevated altitude,

478
00:19:29,724 --> 00:19:32,024
sending a powerful, uninterrupted

479
00:19:32,026 --> 00:19:33,626
signal.

480
00:19:33,628 --> 00:19:35,895
Could be done with a
well-positioned satellite dish.

481
00:19:35,897 --> 00:19:38,531
So, according to the topography,

482
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:40,433
the signal would've most likely
come from somewhere west.

483
00:19:40,435 --> 00:19:41,767
Well, let's get to high ground.

484
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:44,570
See if we can't find the
source of that signal.

485
00:19:44,572 --> 00:19:46,405
And maybe who took our pilot.

486
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,710
Hey.

487
00:19:50,712 --> 00:19:52,445
You figuring all that out?

488
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,247
You're what SEALs call a professor.

489
00:19:54,249 --> 00:19:56,349
I'll take that as a compliment.

490
00:19:56,351 --> 00:19:57,717
It is.

491
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,253
I am so hungry

492
00:20:00,255 --> 00:20:02,255
I would eat my hat if I still had it.

493
00:20:02,257 --> 00:20:03,257
I loved that hat.

494
00:20:03,258 --> 00:20:04,657
Look, you're injured.

495
00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:07,293
Swallow that pride, let me take a look.

496
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,327
I'm a doctor.

497
00:20:08,329 --> 00:20:09,362
You're a psychiatrist.

498
00:20:09,364 --> 00:20:10,930
I went to medical school.

499
00:20:10,932 --> 00:20:13,633
Fine.

500
00:20:13,635 --> 00:20:15,334
Just make it quick.

501
00:20:26,714 --> 00:20:28,581
You have a foot fetish or something?
Hurry it up.

502
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,752
You got a sprain and I'm
concerned about that cut.

503
00:20:31,778 --> 00:20:33,044
Since we don't have any ointment,

504
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,036
I'll do my best to stabilize it.

505
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,462
Why aren't you a real doctor?

506
00:20:43,464 --> 00:20:45,346
I am a real doctor.

507
00:20:45,372 --> 00:20:47,139
You know what I mean. Why a shrink?

508
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:50,770
If you must know, my mother was nuts.

509
00:20:50,772 --> 00:20:52,805
She was clinically bipolar.

510
00:20:52,807 --> 00:20:55,007
And I watched my dad struggle
to manage her illness,

511
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:57,376
so I became a shrink to
try to help them both.

512
00:20:57,378 --> 00:20:58,744
That didn't work.

513
00:20:58,746 --> 00:21:01,347
Geez, Happy, you know that there are

514
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:03,082
whole sections of the
Internet that would pay

515
00:21:03,084 --> 00:21:04,817
top dollar for a peek at these toes.

516
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:07,520
Why do you do that?

517
00:21:07,522 --> 00:21:10,289
As soon as you become human,
you switch to wise-ass.

518
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,391
It's a textbook defense mechanism

519
00:21:12,393 --> 00:21:15,061
to hide how I feel.

520
00:21:15,063 --> 00:21:16,829
Especially around you.

521
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,800
You're so smart and capable

522
00:21:20,802 --> 00:21:22,935
and fun... and that personality

523
00:21:22,937 --> 00:21:25,771
happens to be wrapped in
a nice little package.

524
00:21:25,773 --> 00:21:28,741
So I say stupid things to hide feelings

525
00:21:28,743 --> 00:21:30,243
that you already know that I have.

526
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:31,911
And we got no food,

527
00:21:31,913 --> 00:21:35,014
water or idea where we are,
so if we're gonna die,

528
00:21:35,016 --> 00:21:37,950
I might as well say some stuff, so there.

529
00:21:39,354 --> 00:21:40,953
Are you done?

530
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,290
Do you see that?

531
00:21:44,292 --> 00:21:46,125
You are doing exactly what you said I do.

532
00:21:46,127 --> 00:21:48,127
When things get real, I make wisecracks.

533
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:49,829
You put on your armor.

534
00:21:54,002 --> 00:21:55,868
Look.

535
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,069
Maybe there's supplies up there.

536
00:21:57,071 --> 00:21:59,505
That's a good idea, Gretel.

537
00:21:59,507 --> 00:22:02,375
Let's go to the creepy cottage on the hill.

538
00:22:02,377 --> 00:22:04,777
Grow a pair.

539
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,325
Everyone stand fast, right where you are.

540
00:22:19,327 --> 00:22:21,794
We're in a minefield.

541
00:22:21,796 --> 00:22:23,829
Russian made. Circa World War II.

542
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:25,831
Leftovers from the '95 war.

543
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,733
The Soviets sold 'em at a fire sale.

544
00:22:27,735 --> 00:22:29,302
- Can we double back? 
- You 100% positive

545
00:22:29,304 --> 00:22:31,003
of every step you took to get here?

546
00:22:31,005 --> 00:22:32,672
No way the rebels didn't hear that.

547
00:22:32,674 --> 00:22:36,175
ATV, 40 miles per hour, 10 clicks back...

548
00:22:36,177 --> 00:22:37,310
they'll be on us in...

549
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,511
Nine minutes and 18 seconds.
We gotta move out of here.

550
00:22:38,513 --> 00:22:40,421
The question is where?

551
00:22:40,457 --> 00:22:42,357
What about to the flowers?

552
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,892
If I'm gonna blow up, I'd rather die

553
00:22:43,894 --> 00:22:46,395
in a purple patch of lilies
than die in the dirt.

554
00:22:46,397 --> 00:22:48,363
No one's blowing up.

555
00:22:48,365 --> 00:22:50,532
We're gonna figure this out. Right, Walt?

556
00:22:53,904 --> 00:22:55,437
Walt?

557
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:57,839
No, Paige. You're wrong.

558
00:22:57,841 --> 00:22:59,808
We're not gonna die in the flowers.

559
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:00,742
That's where it's safe.

560
00:23:00,744 --> 00:23:02,077
Explain.

561
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:03,845
All the flowers are in bunches, right?

562
00:23:03,847 --> 00:23:05,480
Everywhere else is dead field.

563
00:23:05,482 --> 00:23:06,348
Why?

564
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,916
- The mines.
- Yeah.

565
00:23:07,918 --> 00:23:09,184
The mines are leaking corrosive chemicals

566
00:23:09,186 --> 00:23:10,986
that will kill any plant that grows above.

567
00:23:10,988 --> 00:23:12,888
So there's no mines under the flowers,

568
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,356
but what about in-between?

569
00:23:14,358 --> 00:23:16,124
Well, no plan's perfect.

570
00:23:19,897 --> 00:23:21,596
Yeah, well...

571
00:23:21,598 --> 00:23:23,532
looks like we're safe up to here.

572
00:23:23,534 --> 00:23:25,334
Come on.

573
00:23:25,336 --> 00:23:26,601
All right, all right, everybody.

574
00:23:26,603 --> 00:23:29,972
Step exactly where the
person in front of you steps.

575
00:23:29,974 --> 00:23:31,873
Travel single-file, and do it fast.

576
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:32,941
In a few minutes,

577
00:23:32,943 --> 00:23:34,609
we're getting shot at again.

578
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,484
For the record,
if we get hacked up right now,

579
00:23:42,486 --> 00:23:44,987
I'm gonna be very upset.

580
00:23:52,062 --> 00:23:53,261
Lights on.

581
00:23:54,698 --> 00:23:57,165
But no one's inside.

582
00:23:59,746 --> 00:24:02,280
Hey, your hand's dirty.

583
00:24:02,306 --> 00:24:04,039
You better go have it
steam-cleaned or something.

584
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:06,241
Why, you little...

585
00:24:06,243 --> 00:24:08,844
I'm Mrs. Garrett,
the school dietician.

586
00:24:08,846 --> 00:24:10,879
You must be... Jo, the new student.

587
00:24:10,881 --> 00:24:11,913
Hi, how's it going?

588
00:24:11,915 --> 00:24:14,182
Did we enter a cabin or a wormhole?

589
00:24:14,184 --> 00:24:15,484
Someone was just here.

590
00:24:15,486 --> 00:24:16,718
We gotta hurry.

591
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,620
Grab any food that's not tied down.

592
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,356
We need water, we need protein.

593
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:24,159
Hey...

594
00:24:27,931 --> 00:24:29,798
Listen, man, we don't want any trouble.

595
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,200
We're just lost hikers.

596
00:24:32,202 --> 00:24:34,102
Americans.

597
00:24:35,172 --> 00:24:37,739
Igor loves USA!

598
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,258
Okay, you go through

599
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,526
the last bunch of flowers,

600
00:24:57,528 --> 00:24:59,761
get on this hill, and we're fine.

601
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:03,598
Thank you.

602
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:05,767
Okay.

603
00:25:09,206 --> 00:25:10,739
Jim...?

604
00:25:10,741 --> 00:25:13,909
No, back away.

605
00:25:15,212 --> 00:25:16,511
I just tripped a mine.

606
00:25:25,988 --> 00:25:28,155
Okay, okay. Hold still, hold still.

607
00:25:28,157 --> 00:25:29,523
No, no... get out... get out of here!

608
00:25:29,525 --> 00:25:31,124
Don't move. Listen to me.

609
00:25:31,126 --> 00:25:32,592
You got me out of a firefight;

610
00:25:32,594 --> 00:25:34,261
I can get you out of this.

611
00:25:34,263 --> 00:25:36,363
Is nice to have visitors.

612
00:25:36,365 --> 00:25:39,199
I live here for six months out of the year.

613
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:42,736
Manage satellite for, government.

614
00:25:42,738 --> 00:25:45,739
It's not, best job,
but I get all the U.S. shows.

615
00:25:45,741 --> 00:25:47,407
Blair! Tootie!

616
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:49,709
Learn<i> Facts of Life.</i>

617
00:25:49,711 --> 00:25:51,044
Hey, Igor, you mind

618
00:25:51,046 --> 00:25:52,546
if we use your computer? We're lost

619
00:25:52,548 --> 00:25:53,780
and really need to find our friends.

620
00:25:53,782 --> 00:25:55,248
It's a matter of survival.

621
00:25:56,385 --> 00:26:00,050
Maybe I can
deactivate the detonator.

622
00:26:02,391 --> 00:26:03,423
Go easy.

623
00:26:06,261 --> 00:26:07,861
Okay, this is bad.

624
00:26:07,863 --> 00:26:09,529
If the pressure shift doesn't detonate this,

625
00:26:09,531 --> 00:26:11,131
there's a back-up timer.

626
00:26:11,133 --> 00:26:12,933
What are we looking at?

627
00:26:12,935 --> 00:26:14,167
About 30 seconds, tops.

628
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:15,802
- Walter...
- You need to get out of here.

629
00:26:15,804 --> 00:26:18,004
I do not want you here
if this does not work.

630
00:26:18,006 --> 00:26:19,339
Get her out of here.

631
00:26:21,043 --> 00:26:22,375
Just need to cut the right cord.

632
00:26:22,377 --> 00:26:23,577
No. Cabe...

633
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:25,512
- get him out of here. 
- Son, you gotta move!

634
00:26:25,514 --> 00:26:26,346
I can do this.

635
00:26:26,348 --> 00:26:28,215
It's speeding up!

636
00:26:28,217 --> 00:26:30,016
- Take off, O'Brien! 
- I've almost got it!

637
00:26:30,018 --> 00:26:33,153
Hold on... hold on... No, there's no time!

638
00:26:33,155 --> 00:26:34,888
- One second, one second...
- It's going off!

639
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,727
What happened?

640
00:26:42,664 --> 00:26:44,364
We're alive.

641
00:26:45,701 --> 00:26:49,002
Must've corroded so much over time...

642
00:26:49,004 --> 00:26:50,604
it's become a dud.

643
00:26:50,606 --> 00:26:53,540
I know Green Berets...

644
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:55,041
but you're crazy.

645
00:26:57,012 --> 00:26:58,378
This is delicious.

646
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,480
It's tongue. You're eating tongue.

647
00:27:03,585 --> 00:27:05,885
Look what he had minimized...

648
00:27:05,887 --> 00:27:07,587
a massive transmission
that was sent by satellite.

649
00:27:07,589 --> 00:27:08,922
What kind of transmission?

650
00:27:08,924 --> 00:27:09,924
Coordinates.

651
00:27:09,925 --> 00:27:11,758
False GPS coordinates.

652
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,760
Sent roughly 24 hours ago.

653
00:27:15,831 --> 00:27:18,298
Well, that's just about the
time our plane went down.

654
00:27:24,439 --> 00:27:26,573
Not so fast, comrade!

655
00:27:26,575 --> 00:27:28,275
Why the hell did you crash that plane?

656
00:27:29,111 --> 00:27:31,678
Now I see why Cabe put you in charge.

657
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,846
I know nothing of a plane.

658
00:27:32,848 --> 00:27:35,282
Just manage satellite for government.

659
00:27:35,851 --> 00:27:37,784
Okay, okay! Don't shoot.

660
00:27:37,786 --> 00:27:40,287
Bad men come.

661
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:42,055
They pay me money to use satellite.

662
00:27:42,057 --> 00:27:43,290
They send pornography...

663
00:27:43,292 --> 00:27:45,025
it's illegal,

664
00:27:45,027 --> 00:27:46,860
but I have no choice.

665
00:27:46,862 --> 00:27:48,962
Even timbre, level eye-white exposure;

666
00:27:48,964 --> 00:27:50,096
he's telling the truth.

667
00:27:50,098 --> 00:27:51,831
They weren't sending porn.

668
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:53,833
They were rebels taking down a jet.

669
00:27:53,835 --> 00:27:55,635
Igor hates rebels.

670
00:27:55,637 --> 00:27:57,270
You know where the rebels are right now?

671
00:27:59,508 --> 00:28:00,507
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

672
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:01,541
Slow down. Slow down.

673
00:28:01,543 --> 00:28:02,509
You're where?

674
00:28:02,511 --> 00:28:04,144
At a hilltop sat station.

675
00:28:04,146 --> 00:28:06,279
We think you're walking
right into the rebel base.

676
00:28:06,281 --> 00:28:07,614
I'm texting you the coordinates now.

677
00:28:07,616 --> 00:28:08,915
Rebel base?

678
00:28:08,917 --> 00:28:10,483
That's exactly what we're looking for.

679
00:28:10,485 --> 00:28:11,951
Isn't the idea to avoid the rebels?

680
00:28:11,953 --> 00:28:12,952
Yeah, well, it's a long story,

681
00:28:12,954 --> 00:28:14,721
but they have our software and the pilot.

682
00:28:14,723 --> 00:28:16,489
The base isn't

683
00:28:16,491 --> 00:28:17,957
that far from here.

684
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:19,592
The odds are that's where
they brought our man.

685
00:28:19,594 --> 00:28:20,760
We're going in to find him.

686
00:28:20,762 --> 00:28:23,763
Suddenly I am glad we fell down that ravine.

687
00:28:23,765 --> 00:28:25,498
Walt, that doesn't sound safe.

688
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,466
Okay, listen to me.

689
00:28:26,468 --> 00:28:28,134
You hike a mile east of the main road

690
00:28:28,136 --> 00:28:29,869
outside the rebel compound.

691
00:28:29,871 --> 00:28:31,304
We'll rendezvous there.

692
00:28:31,306 --> 00:28:34,874
Now, if we don't show by nightfall, then...

693
00:28:34,876 --> 00:28:36,343
find your way back home.

694
00:28:36,345 --> 00:28:38,244
Hey, Walter, weren't we guys

695
00:28:38,246 --> 00:28:40,146
who just fixed computers, like, yesterday?

696
00:28:40,148 --> 00:28:41,915
Yeah, looks like we're more than that now.

697
00:28:41,917 --> 00:28:44,718
Okay,
we need radio silence from here on out.

698
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,453
Bye.

699
00:28:46,455 --> 00:28:48,088
I hope to see you guys soon.

700
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:52,592
Before we jump into this mess,

701
00:28:52,594 --> 00:28:54,060
I want to thank you for what you did

702
00:28:54,062 --> 00:28:55,228
back there at the minefield.

703
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,896
It was no big deal.

704
00:28:56,898 --> 00:28:58,331
Had a problem, saw a solution.

705
00:28:58,333 --> 00:28:59,999
You know, it was pretty impressive,

706
00:29:00,001 --> 00:29:02,135
what you did with that, rocket launcher.

707
00:29:02,137 --> 00:29:03,603
No big deal.

708
00:29:03,605 --> 00:29:05,171
Had a problem, saw a solution.

709
00:29:06,908 --> 00:29:08,708
Here...

710
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,043
I thought you could use this.

711
00:29:10,045 --> 00:29:13,880
Spilled half of it on the way here, but...

712
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:15,382
what do you expect from a
girl whose nerve endings

713
00:29:15,384 --> 00:29:16,449
are slowly deteriorating?

714
00:29:16,451 --> 00:29:18,952
That's a terrible thing to say.

715
00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:22,419
What are you afraid of, Sylvester?

716
00:29:22,445 --> 00:29:24,345
- Everything. 
- No.

717
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:26,204
I mean the motel key.

718
00:29:29,297 --> 00:29:31,698
Hey, you can trust me.

719
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,800
What's bothering you?

720
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:41,975
Okay.

721
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:47,414
The way I am...

722
00:29:47,416 --> 00:29:49,048
frustrated my parents.

723
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:52,365
So, when I was 16,

724
00:29:52,367 --> 00:29:55,936
I hacked a bank

725
00:29:55,938 --> 00:29:57,871
and I stole $2,500

726
00:29:57,873 --> 00:29:59,172
and I ran away.

727
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:01,174
Soon, I was broke

728
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:04,444
and alone and...

729
00:30:04,446 --> 00:30:06,413
scared...

730
00:30:06,415 --> 00:30:08,215
in a crappy motel room.

731
00:30:08,217 --> 00:30:09,983
I was in a bad place,

732
00:30:09,985 --> 00:30:14,054
considering... bad things.

733
00:30:15,324 --> 00:30:18,725
Until a forensic analyst from the bank

734
00:30:18,727 --> 00:30:20,060
tracked me down.

735
00:30:20,062 --> 00:30:21,695
Walter.

736
00:30:21,697 --> 00:30:23,029
To this day,

737
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:25,665
the bank still thinks I
was never apprehended.

738
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:27,334
Walter's the only person on Earth

739
00:30:27,336 --> 00:30:29,002
who knows this story.

740
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:31,605
He was there for me.

741
00:30:31,607 --> 00:30:34,841
And now I'm not there for him.

742
00:30:34,843 --> 00:30:37,744
You... you have worked really hard...

743
00:30:37,746 --> 00:30:39,579
No. You found the satellite photos...

744
00:30:39,581 --> 00:30:41,615
No, no. I told him

745
00:30:41,617 --> 00:30:44,050
I had to work from here and that was a lie.

746
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:46,052
I was afraid to go.

747
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:47,420
And he knew.

748
00:30:47,422 --> 00:30:48,655
And he let me stay.

749
00:30:48,657 --> 00:30:50,490
That's how good a friend he is

750
00:30:50,492 --> 00:30:52,626
and that's how lousy I am.

751
00:30:54,529 --> 00:30:56,296
Looks like a run-down farmhouse.

752
00:30:56,298 --> 00:30:57,764
Hold on.

753
00:30:57,766 --> 00:30:58,965
Look.

754
00:31:00,702 --> 00:31:03,670
Those farmers are armed to the teeth.

755
00:31:03,672 --> 00:31:07,440
I don't remember Old MacDonald
having a gun in that song.

756
00:31:07,442 --> 00:31:10,377
My pilot, your software;
they're both in that barn.

757
00:31:10,379 --> 00:31:11,811
You ready to go get what's ours?

758
00:31:11,813 --> 00:31:13,346
That's what we came for.

759
00:31:13,348 --> 00:31:14,547
Okay, it'll be dark soon.

760
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:16,449
Walter and I will have cover
to breach the compound,

761
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:17,484
retrieve Barrios,

762
00:31:17,486 --> 00:31:18,652
recover the tech. Cabe, Luke...

763
00:31:18,654 --> 00:31:20,120
you steal the van

764
00:31:20,122 --> 00:31:21,888
and sneak around back and pick us up.

765
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,890
Paige, Simon's out of commission.

766
00:31:23,892 --> 00:31:25,258
Get him down to the service road.

767
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,192
We'll pick you up, then we're Oscar Mike.

768
00:31:26,194 --> 00:31:27,227
- Copy? 
- Copy.

769
00:31:27,229 --> 00:31:28,428
All right.

770
00:31:32,634 --> 00:31:33,733
Hey.

771
00:31:33,735 --> 00:31:35,936
Hey. I'd off you a good-luck charm,

772
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:38,104
but I know you don't believe in that, so...

773
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:39,706
just get back safe, okay?

774
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:41,574
Okay.

775
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,919
Ooh! That's gonna hurt.

776
00:31:52,921 --> 00:31:54,220
All right.

777
00:31:54,222 --> 00:31:55,956
As soon as I open this door,
it's gonna get hot.

778
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:58,458
Stay back until the shooting's over.

779
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,927
That seems logical.

780
00:32:10,706 --> 00:32:12,272
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

781
00:32:16,611 --> 00:32:17,811
Okay.

782
00:32:18,747 --> 00:32:21,214
Three, two, one.

783
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,873
What is encryption code?

784
00:32:48,143 --> 00:32:49,476
Give us the code!

785
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,279
Careful.

786
00:32:53,281 --> 00:32:55,048
There's a fuel vat right next to him.

787
00:32:56,985 --> 00:32:58,184
You miss, you blow him up.

788
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:01,888
Yes...

789
00:33:21,576 --> 00:33:22,576
Who are you?

790
00:33:22,577 --> 00:33:24,411
Lieutenant Jim Corbett, U.S. Navy SEALs.

791
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,246
I'm bringing you home.

792
00:33:28,245 --> 00:33:29,778
I'm the tech guy.

793
00:33:30,639 --> 00:33:32,147
I'm helping.

794
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,344
You gotta be kidding me.

795
00:33:56,884 --> 00:33:58,384
Fan belt's gone.

796
00:33:58,386 --> 00:34:00,019
The fan belt?

797
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:01,387
Why are you calling me?

798
00:34:01,389 --> 00:34:03,089
Happy is the expert.

799
00:34:03,091 --> 00:34:05,357
Because we're not in Burbank,
we're in Bosnia,

800
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:06,726
and we got shoddy reception.

801
00:34:06,728 --> 00:34:08,761
Now, we're storming a rebel base,

802
00:34:08,763 --> 00:34:10,696
so I need you to man up, son.

803
00:34:10,698 --> 00:34:12,631
Our life depends on it.

804
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:15,634
Okay, we need something strong yet pliable

805
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,870
that can withstand the
coefficient of friction.

806
00:34:17,872 --> 00:34:19,805
Something like... pantyhose.

807
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:22,341
Now, why the hell would I have pantyhose?

808
00:34:23,277 --> 00:34:24,510
I got a multi-tool,

809
00:34:24,512 --> 00:34:26,345
12 mags of ammo, first aid kit,

810
00:34:26,347 --> 00:34:27,613
toilet paper.

811
00:34:27,615 --> 00:34:29,181
The toilet paper!

812
00:34:29,183 --> 00:34:30,783
Okay, pull it into long strips,

813
00:34:30,785 --> 00:34:32,318
and braid it in a hexagonal pattern.

814
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,654
This makes the paper increase
its strength exponentially.

815
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:38,023
Hooke's law of elasticity.

816
00:34:38,025 --> 00:34:39,859
How'd you know that? Who's my brother?

817
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:41,794
I'm bound to pick up something.

818
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:46,932
I got him.

819
00:34:46,934 --> 00:34:48,033
Grab the tech, let's go.

820
00:34:48,035 --> 00:34:49,168
Okay.

821
00:34:56,978 --> 00:34:58,911
You think you can come here,

822
00:34:58,913 --> 00:35:00,446
take what you want?

823
00:35:04,886 --> 00:35:07,286
From me?

824
00:35:07,288 --> 00:35:08,554
Stop!

825
00:35:08,556 --> 00:35:10,289
Beat him all you like, it's useless.

826
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:11,924
He can't help you.

827
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,460
I can. You?

828
00:35:14,462 --> 00:35:16,495
I don't even know what you are.

829
00:35:16,497 --> 00:35:18,164
All right?

830
00:35:21,135 --> 00:35:23,135
I'll tell you what I'm not,
I'm not a soldier.

831
00:35:23,137 --> 00:35:27,139
I'm a tech specialist sent
in to get that software,

832
00:35:27,141 --> 00:35:28,374
and I will get it for you,

833
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,775
but you have to let us go.

834
00:35:29,777 --> 00:35:32,444
You-you really think
they're gonna let us go?

835
00:35:32,446 --> 00:35:35,014
You tried your way.

836
00:35:35,016 --> 00:35:36,048
Do we have a deal?

837
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,084
You decode it, you leave.

838
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,266
Okay.

839
00:35:54,268 --> 00:35:55,768
We're done.

840
00:35:56,871 --> 00:35:58,470
Now we go?

841
00:35:58,472 --> 00:36:01,040
No, you not leave till
software's fully downloaded.

842
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,770
You erased it?!

843
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:34,139
Now!

844
00:36:41,382 --> 00:36:43,249
Drop it.

845
00:36:43,251 --> 00:36:45,784
My bosses be upset I
not bring them software.

846
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,487
So, instead, I bring them your head.

847
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,336
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey-- we gotta go.

848
00:37:04,338 --> 00:37:05,971
Oscar Mike.

849
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,840
So you're speaking the lingo now?

850
00:37:11,512 --> 00:37:12,611
Okay, hold on...

851
00:37:12,613 --> 00:37:14,146
Where the hell is he?

852
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,915
Come on, Cabe.

853
00:37:18,252 --> 00:37:20,352
Welcome to the Charmin Express.

854
00:37:23,224 --> 00:37:26,425
Go, go, go, go, go, go...!

855
00:37:30,631 --> 00:37:32,331
I was nervous you wouldn't show.

856
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,066
Wasn't without its drama.

857
00:37:34,068 --> 00:37:36,335
Your wife wanted you to have this.

858
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,640
Thank you.

859
00:37:41,642 --> 00:37:43,442
Thanks to all of you.

860
00:37:43,444 --> 00:37:45,210
Actually, we're not all here.

861
00:37:45,212 --> 00:37:47,079
I thought we would have seen them by now.

862
00:37:47,081 --> 00:37:49,181
When we get to the plane,
we'll call the embassy

863
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,549
and form a search party.

864
00:37:50,551 --> 00:37:53,085
Don't know if that's necessary.

865
00:38:03,898 --> 00:38:06,098
None of you saw this.

866
00:38:19,113 --> 00:38:21,280
How you feeling, pal?

867
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,283
Such a liar.

868
00:38:30,006 --> 00:38:32,740
It's good to be home.

869
00:38:32,741 --> 00:38:34,207
You see him?

870
00:38:34,209 --> 00:38:36,109
Go give him a hug.

871
00:38:39,681 --> 00:38:42,058
Not bad for two days' work.

872
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:43,925
Not at all.

873
00:38:43,927 --> 00:38:46,862
But I really want to see my son now.

874
00:38:46,864 --> 00:38:48,764
Copy that.

875
00:38:48,766 --> 00:38:50,966
Glad to give you a lift.

876
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:54,903
You know the sad thing--

877
00:38:54,905 --> 00:38:57,639
that was my first time outside the U.S.

878
00:38:58,675 --> 00:39:00,442
Hey.

879
00:39:02,179 --> 00:39:03,712
Yeah.

880
00:39:03,714 --> 00:39:05,147
I want you to have this.

881
00:39:07,851 --> 00:39:09,484
It's our unit's challenge coin...

882
00:39:11,421 --> 00:39:13,889
...for exemplary service on a mission.

883
00:39:17,661 --> 00:39:19,027
Okay.

884
00:39:19,029 --> 00:39:20,262
Hey, okay, um...

885
00:39:20,264 --> 00:39:22,764
hold on a second.

886
00:39:24,134 --> 00:39:26,601
Take this.

887
00:39:26,603 --> 00:39:28,937
It's an override code for your DVR.

888
00:39:28,939 --> 00:39:30,972
Free war movies for life.

889
00:39:32,109 --> 00:39:33,608
Come on.

890
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,644
Okay.

891
00:39:41,084 --> 00:39:43,919
If I was any more exhausted,
I'd melt into a puddle.

892
00:39:44,721 --> 00:39:46,021
You guys are back! Walter!

893
00:39:46,023 --> 00:39:47,122
Hey!

894
00:39:47,124 --> 00:39:48,323
How you doing?

895
00:39:48,325 --> 00:39:50,725
Okay.

896
00:39:50,727 --> 00:39:51,827
Next time, Walter,

897
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:54,129
I will be with you on
the mission, I promise.

898
00:39:54,131 --> 00:39:55,664
You were, pal, you were right there.

899
00:39:55,666 --> 00:39:58,300
No. Bullets weren't flying in here.

900
00:39:58,302 --> 00:39:59,768
I'll be there.

901
00:40:01,038 --> 00:40:02,637
Hey, Toby.

902
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:05,040
For the record, you took good
care of me, and I appreciate it.

903
00:40:05,042 --> 00:40:06,141
Thank you.

904
00:40:06,143 --> 00:40:08,476
I could take better care of you.

905
00:40:08,478 --> 00:40:11,146
You never give up.

906
00:40:12,216 --> 00:40:14,049
Good.

907
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,727
Quite a life you're leading.

908
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:34,569
Well, we've both probably had
enough excitement for a while.

909
00:40:34,571 --> 00:40:36,037
You ready to go?

910
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:38,139
Yeah.

911
00:40:38,976 --> 00:40:41,343
Um...

912
00:40:41,345 --> 00:40:43,311
Do you know how this box got here?

913
00:40:43,313 --> 00:40:45,013
No.

914
00:40:54,725 --> 00:40:58,326
Thank you for the last couple of days.

915
00:40:59,363 --> 00:41:01,529
I'll never forget it.

916
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,380
New car?

917
00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:18,446
No, no.

918
00:41:18,448 --> 00:41:20,315
It's, Paige's.

919
00:41:20,317 --> 00:41:22,550
Cabe's dropping her off from the airport.

920
00:41:24,354 --> 00:41:26,554
Mine keeps on breaking down.

921
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:30,625
You know, I'm pretty low on funds,

922
00:41:30,627 --> 00:41:33,128
what do you say to no
more bailouts for a while?

923
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:35,096
I'll behave, if...

924
00:41:35,098 --> 00:41:36,765
if you explain this.

925
00:41:36,767 --> 00:41:38,366
I don't know what that is.

926
00:41:38,368 --> 00:41:40,235
You kept this.

927
00:41:40,237 --> 00:41:41,903
All those years?

928
00:41:41,905 --> 00:41:43,338
No, I didn't.

929
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,607
Tokens, talismans,
they're a sign of weakness.

930
00:41:45,609 --> 00:41:46,775
Walter!

931
00:41:46,777 --> 00:41:49,911
I found it in that box.

932
00:41:51,748 --> 00:41:55,250
Okay, when you were 12,

933
00:41:55,252 --> 00:41:57,252
you had a fever.

934
00:41:57,254 --> 00:41:58,687
And there was no hope.

935
00:41:58,689 --> 00:41:59,988
And I just...

936
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:03,491
I wanted to have something to remember you.

937
00:42:03,493 --> 00:42:05,794
So...

938
00:42:05,796 --> 00:42:08,830
It bothers me that I
keep that stupid trinket.

939
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,600
It's superstition...

940
00:42:11,601 --> 00:42:13,101
No, it's normal.

941
00:42:13,103 --> 00:42:16,838
But, you know, you're gonna have to accept

942
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:20,075
that I'm gonna leave you someday.

943
00:42:20,077 --> 00:42:22,077
And that day is coming soon.

944
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,112
No, I refuse accept that premise.

945
00:42:24,114 --> 00:42:26,781
We've got to enjoy every
moment we can right now.

946
00:42:26,783 --> 00:42:28,950
You know what?

947
00:42:30,687 --> 00:42:32,120
Hey.

948
00:42:32,122 --> 00:42:34,022
We don't need it. Come on.

949
00:42:34,024 --> 00:42:36,458
I don't want you to keep
memories from when I was sick.

950
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:39,427
Let's make new ones
while we still can, okay?

951
00:42:41,264 --> 00:42:42,297
Okay.

952
00:42:42,299 --> 00:42:45,166
Good, now, take me back to the hospital.

953
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,773
Not yet.

954
00:42:56,179 --> 00:42:57,612
It's beautiful.

955
00:42:57,614 --> 00:42:59,314
Our first new memory.

956
00:43:00,165 --> 00:43:04,462
