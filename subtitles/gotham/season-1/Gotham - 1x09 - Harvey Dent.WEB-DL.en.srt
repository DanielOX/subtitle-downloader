1
00:00:01,133 --> 00:00:02,468
<i>Previously on</i> gotham...

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:04,670
Mooney:<i> Killing falcone</i>
<i>would only create chaos.</i>

3
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:06,005
<i>I need to siphon his strength.</i>

4
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:07,940
<i>So, when the time is right,</i>

5
00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:09,408
<i>Taking over his organization</i>

6
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,276
Will be like
slipping on a glove.

7
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:13,812
I'm so angry all the time.

8
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:15,481
Will that ever go away?

9
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:17,583
Alfred, can you teach me
how to fight?

10
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,852
You've been
through a lot.

11
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:21,320
I'm scared, jim.

12
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:22,454
Everywhere I go,

13
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:24,656
<i>I can feel that monster, zsasz.</i>

14
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:27,126
Alvarez:<i> Gordon,</i>
<i>some unis brought in a perp.</i>

15
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:28,627
<i>Claims to know you.</i>

16
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:29,928
Hey, detective.

17
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:32,865
Miss me?

18
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,538
Barbara?

19
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,409
Whoa.

20
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:45,244
Sweet crib.

21
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,614
You must be one rich cop.

22
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:50,482
It's my girlfriend's place.

23
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:51,750
Where is she?

24
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,886
I don't know.
Barbara?

25
00:00:57,757 --> 00:00:59,491
So... What?

26
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:00,826
I get to stay here alone?

27
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,664
I'm hungry.

28
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,599
Barbara:
<i>Dear jim,</i>

29
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:10,369
<i>I thought I could be strong</i>
<i>and brave for you, but I can't.</i>

30
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:14,173
<i>Every place I go,</i>
<i>I see falcone and zsasz.</i>

31
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:16,508
<i>I'm nervous and needy</i>
<i>and screwed up,</i>

32
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,577
<i>And I know that's not</i>
<i>what you need or want,</i>

33
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,846
<i>So I'm going away for a while,</i>
<i>to get myself together.</i>

34
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:22,948
(cell phone ringing)

35
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,587
This is gordon.

36
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,289
Uh... Uh, right.

37
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,423
Yeah.

38
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,792
We're in the penthouse.
Come on up.

39
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,734
Sounds like your girlfriend's
not coming back, huh?

40
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:44,636
Why's she worried
about falcone?

41
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,205
None of your business.

42
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:47,906
So what happens now?

43
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,708
You gonna get the charges
against me dropped?

44
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,711
I will, but you're my only
witness to the wayne murders.

45
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:54,880
You gonna cuff me
to a drainpipe again?

46
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:56,782
No, I'm not gonna hold you
against your will.

47
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,584
Gcpd, juvie--
you'd just break out.

48
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:00,552
So I do get to stay here.

49
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:02,554
No, I have someplace
else in mind.

50
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:04,223
(knocking on door)

51
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:06,291
That's the sketch artist.

52
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,327
I need you to describe
the man who shot the waynes.

53
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:11,597
Wait, where am I going to stay?

54
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,065
Wayne manor.

55
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,642
Do not speak
to the inmate.

56
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,245
Do not touch the inmate unless
in the service of your job.

57
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:28,914
Do not accept anything from the
inmate under any circumstances.

58
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,716
Who is this guy,
anyway?

59
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:33,018
<i>Name's ian hargrove,</i>
<i>some genius bomb maker.</i>

60
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,487
<i>Took out over a dozen buildings</i>
<i>in and around gotham.</i>

61
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,523
<i>He's the one that blew up</i>
<i>the commissary last month?</i>

62
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:39,291
Yeah, and he did it
with match shavings

63
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:40,459
And apple cider vinegar.

64
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,361
So no mistakes today, got it?

65
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,013
Put your hands up.

66
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,455
(latch slides, clicks)

67
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,932
She said this is the man
who killed your parents.

68
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:22,100
She said she saw his face.

69
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:24,570
Do you recognize him,
bruce?

70
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:27,005
No.

71
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:30,709
What's her name?

72
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,144
Selina kyle.

73
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:33,812
Do you believe her?

74
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:35,047
Yes, I do.

75
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,382
So, she saw...

76
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,051
Everything?

77
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:44,723
And you want her to live here
with us, do you?

78
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,191
A common street criminal.

79
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:47,492
She's hardly older than bruce.

80
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:50,362
She's just a kid
who's seen too much.

81
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:52,030
This is for her safety.

82
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,832
Gcpd is full of moles...

83
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,235
Right, and how long would you
have us put her up, then?

84
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:57,636
I don't know.

85
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:59,805
No.
The answer is no.

86
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:02,207
Her being here will put
master bruce in great danger.

87
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,909
Alfred.

88
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,812
She is the witness
to a murder, master bruce.

89
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:08,046
You do understand that,
don't you?

90
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,615
She's also
the best chance we have

91
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:10,849
Of finding
who killed my parents.

92
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,318
Isn't she?

93
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,286
Yes, she is.

94
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:16,955
Then she can stay.

95
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,259
As long as it takes.

96
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,164
I've made my decision.

97
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,568
Yes, master bruce.

98
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:35,340
Look, I know this is a lot.

99
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,342
But I'm doing
everything I can.

100
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,011
Montoya and allen
and I are meeting

101
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:40,979
With an ada they trust
this afternoon.

102
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,948
Oh...

103
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,783
A trustworthy lawyer.

104
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,785
In gotham.

105
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,788
Look, if we find this guy,
we'll need her.

106
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,989
She'll have to testify.

107
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:52,190
Go before a judge.

108
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:53,392
It won't be easy.

109
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:56,361
Witnesses back
out all the time.

110
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,963
The ones that stick it out do so

111
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,431
Because they care
about the victims.

112
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:03,201
We'll do our best to be nice
to her, then, won't we?

113
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,848
It's from the chinese
ming dynasty.

114
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,053
Five...

115
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,991
500 years old.

116
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:29,494
You can get one just like it
for five bucks, in chinatown.

117
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,073
I'm bruce wayne.

118
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,944
Selina kyle.

119
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,915
People call me cat.

120
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:52,150
Nice to meet you, cat.

121
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,830
What are you doing?

122
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:06,765
Nothing.

123
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,767
What's in your hand?

124
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,836
I said, what's in...

125
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,148
What the hell...?

126
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,351
(tires screeching,
horn honking)

127
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,643
Hargrove!

128
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,648
Ian hargrove, time to go.

129
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:08,293
Man:
<i>Kid, you screwed up, big-time.</i>

130
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:11,163
But you're still young,
you deserve a second chance.

131
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:12,564
So I have a
bet for you.

132
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,934
You call heads
or tails.

133
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,136
You lose, you go to jail.

134
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,572
You win, we let you go.

135
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:22,207
Bet.
Hold on.

136
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,975
There's a catch.

137
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,112
You have to make a promise
to god right now.

138
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,815
If you win, you're gonna
take this as a sign from him

139
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:31,817
Telling you that you need
to go back to school

140
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:32,884
And get your
life straight.

141
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:34,219
Can you promise that?

142
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,754
Do you promise that?

143
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:37,522
Yes, sir.

144
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,426
Okay then.

145
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,497
Call.
Heads.

146
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,502
Walk away, kid.

147
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,705
Somebody up there loves you.

148
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,574
Hey, harvey.

149
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,244
Go.

150
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:00,278
Remember your promise.

151
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,281
Jim gordon, gcpd.

152
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,950
I hear good things
about you, counselor.

153
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:07,219
Harvey dent, likewise
about you, detective.

154
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:09,120
That was some trick
with the coin.

155
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,455
What if the kid guesses wrong?

156
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:11,990
You gonna send him to jail?

157
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,825
Teenagers, they nearly
always call heads.

158
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:14,993
I don't know why.

159
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:19,030
Two-headed coin.

160
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,832
Whatever works, right?

161
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,734
Dent:
<i>So who is he, jim?</i>

162
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,769
Who really killed the waynes?

163
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:27,873
This is what we have.

164
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,441
No I.D.

165
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:31,009
But this is from an eyewitness?

166
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,410
That you have in safe custody.

167
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:35,981
It's not nearly enough
to go to the law with.

168
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,382
Even if we had I.D. On this guy,

169
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:38,984
It's the people who hired him
we really want.

170
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,318
I agree.

171
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,787
Your eyewitness is useless
in a courtroom.

172
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,623
But the idea
of your witness

173
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,525
Could be immensely valuable.

174
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,962
Ever hear the name
dick lovecraft?

175
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,831
Sure. Billionaire.

176
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,766
Property, construction,
chemicals.

177
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:55,967
And as corrupt
as they come.

178
00:08:55,969 --> 00:09:00,272
Falcone, maroni,
even wayne enterprises,

179
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:02,474
Lovecraft has dealings
with all of them.

180
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:04,209
Since the waynes' deaths,
he's doubled his fortune.

181
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,111
Including a huge piece
of the arkham deal.

182
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:08,280
Dent: Lovecraft had a long
feud with thomas wayne

183
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:10,115
Over deals
and politics.

184
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:12,150
They couldn't have had a more
different vision for gotham.

185
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,019
I'm willing to bet my career...

186
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:15,487
On his involvement
in the wayne murders.

187
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:16,621
That's a big bet.

188
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:17,656
I want to use your witness

189
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:19,391
To go after lovecraft.

190
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:22,427
How? My witness can't connect
lovecraft to the perp.

191
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:25,530
Lovecraft doesn't know that.

192
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:27,299
I'll let it leak out

193
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:29,067
That we have a
secret eyewitness

194
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,202
Who's going to blow
the case wide open

195
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:33,071
And connect lovecraft
to the wayne killings.

196
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,739
Lovecraft will get very nervous.

197
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,975
And the people around
him will get nervous.

198
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:39,377
And that's when people start
talking; you know how that goes.

199
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,546
Unless lovecraft wasn't involved
in the wayne murders.

200
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:43,181
If so, which I doubt,
we still win.

201
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:44,716
Whoever was involved
in the wayne killings

202
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,484
Will get their
cage rattled

203
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:47,485
Like the dickens, won't they?

204
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:48,520
I bet he makes a move.

205
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:50,422
You like to bet a lot.

206
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,691
Well, what do we got to lose?

207
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:54,225
My witness becomes a target.

208
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:55,226
No.

209
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:56,261
That's the beauty of it.

210
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,362
We never actually file papers.

211
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,531
We never name names.

212
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:01,666
It's just a
powerful story.

213
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,134
Your witness is perfectly safe.

214
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:04,502
And you're on board with this?

215
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:05,737
We've been on board, jim.

216
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,272
Harvey's one of us.

217
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,274
I want what you want, jim.

218
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,744
I want to make this city
a better place.

219
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,350
No names.

220
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:21,519
Not mine, not my witness,
nothing-- just a story.

221
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:24,289
Just a story.

222
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,491
All right.

223
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:27,759
Let's try something.

224
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,200
Hey, I thought I was gonna have
to work this case without you.

225
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:36,401
Where the hell have you been?

226
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:37,802
You know what?

227
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,471
On second thought, never mind,
I don't want to know.

228
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:40,705
What do we got?

229
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,507
A biggie.

230
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,409
Blackgate prisoner escaped
while in transit to st. Mark's

231
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:45,710
For psychiatric care.

232
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:48,346
His name's ian hargrove,
clinically insane,

233
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,515
With a compulsion for
blowing things up.

234
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:53,451
He exploded a bunch of
old buildings around gotham.

235
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,654
Last one,
two janitors were killed.

236
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,355
Says here he was busted out
by four gunmen?

237
00:10:57,357 --> 00:11:00,392
Yeah, which is odd--
hargrove never used accomplices.

238
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:03,161
All right, so who did hargrove
spend time with at blackgate?

239
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,230
Who did he communicate with
on the outside?

240
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:08,566
His entire stretch,
he was isolated from gen pop.

241
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:10,335
Never made
or received phone calls.

242
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,137
Only one visitor
in those two years--

243
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,138
His brother john.

244
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,807
Got an address?
We do.

245
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,742
Unis are bringing him
in right now for questioning.

246
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:20,245
We're lucky you deigned
to show up.

247
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:21,646
Yeah, sorry.

248
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:24,182
No problem.

249
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:26,818
Girl trouble?

250
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,453
Yeah.

251
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,088
I told you.

252
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,291
Those high society dames--
get you all twisted.

253
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,462
Keep your guard up.

254
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:38,496
Knock lumps out of ya.

255
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:39,798
Watch your feet.

256
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,266
Right...
Jab, jab, right.

257
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:42,500
(grunting)

258
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:43,501
Lead with the...
Hey!

259
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:44,736
Jab, jab, right.
Jab, jab, right.

260
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,037
(grunting)
jab, jab, right.

261
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,372
Keep that guard up--
jab, jab, right.

262
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,841
Lead...
Jab, jab, right.

263
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:50,975
Jab, jab, right.

264
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,744
Now keep that...

265
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,113
(grunts fiercely)
yes.

266
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:56,114
(laughing)
oi!

267
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,348
Sorry, alfred.

268
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,483
Hello.
Bruce.

269
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,554
That hurt.

270
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:03,755
Yeah, it's supposed to,
isn't it?

271
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:05,423
Taking a punch is

272
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,559
Just as important
as throwing one, master bruce.

273
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,160
What you doing?

274
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,829
Alfred's teaching
me to fight.

275
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,030
Why?

276
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:14,499
So I'll be prepared if
something bad happens.

277
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:19,137
Yeah, 'cause you live
in a pretty rough neighborhood.

278
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:20,739
Not here,
in gotham.

279
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,108
In gotham, people don't fight
with gloves on.

280
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:27,445
How's your room?

281
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:28,513
Everything good?

282
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,649
It'll do.

283
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,218
I'm hungry, though.

284
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,419
Right.

285
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,088
Well, breakfast was
served at 8:00, miss,

286
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,357
Which you slept through.

287
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,525
Lunch shall be
served at 12:00.

288
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:41,893
There's plenty to
eat in the kitchen.

289
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:43,294
And alfred will be happy
to fix you something.

290
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:44,496
No, he won't be, will he?

291
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:45,897
Because it's not
a bloody hotel.

292
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,601
Relax, old man.

293
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,102
I'll figure it out.

294
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,470
Yeah, you can mind
your manners as well,

295
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,205
You cheeky little minx.

296
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:56,508
Be nice to her, alfred,
she's our guest.

297
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,477
Well, I'm terribly sorry,
master bruce.

298
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,312
Didn't realize you fancied her.

299
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:02,614
What do you mean?

300
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,249
N-no.

301
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:05,650
Well, it's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

302
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:07,252
It's only natural, isn't it?

303
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:08,820
But you watch her.

304
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:12,023
She's a lairy one.

305
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,958
Right... Left, left, right.

306
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,428
(grunts)
keep your guard up, son.

307
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,430
You know about girls,
do you, alfred?

308
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,232
Fair sight more than you.

309
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,501
And she, mate,

310
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,203
Is trouble--
watch.

311
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:27,071
Oi! Oi, oi!

312
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,429
Liza, liza...

313
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,565
What are you up to?

314
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,065
(inhales deeply)

315
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,475
(inhaling)

00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,782
(quiet laugh)

317
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,718
Lilacs.

318
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,748
♪ ♪

319
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,562
I'm telling you, I don't know
anything about his escape.

320
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:32,597
I haven't talked to him.

321
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,631
Your own baby brother

322
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,733
Busts out of prison,
and doesn't call you,

323
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,535
The only person he's
talked to in two years?

324
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,203
What happened?

325
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:40,371
You two have a falling out?

326
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:41,906
No, ian and I are close.

327
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:43,107
Always have been.

328
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,143
Even after he bombed
those janitors?

329
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:46,411
That was an accident.

330
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:48,746
Bullock:
<i>That's what they all say.</i>

331
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,048
John hargrove:
<i>It's the truth.</i>

332
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,283
(timer dings)

333
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,818
My brother's not a killer.

334
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,186
He never was.

335
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:57,889
He blew up 12 buildings
in gotham.

336
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:00,892
Yes, munitions factories
and their offices.

337
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:03,461
<i>Places that made guns</i>
<i>and bullets and missiles.</i>

338
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,730
<i>I know he was wrong,</i>

339
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:08,599
<i>But ian thought that</i>
<i>what he was doing was good.</i>

340
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:13,471
<i>He didn't hurt a soul</i>
<i>until the last bombing.</i>

341
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,373
And he felt terrible about it.

342
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:19,010
He practically handed himself in
to the cops and pleaded guilty.

343
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,048
Ian has had mental problems
ever since he was a kid.

344
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,116
<i>My parents didn't</i>
<i>have the money</i>

345
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:26,851
<i>To get him the help he needed.</i>

346
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:29,120
And he sure as hell wasn't
getting it at blackgate.

347
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,424
<i>Look...</i>

348
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,960
My brother's not a bad man.

349
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:38,463
Then what is he?

350
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,367
He's sick.

351
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:44,435
<i>There's a difference.</i>

352
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,441
Gordon:<i> Okay...</i>

353
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,877
<i>So who would want</i>
<i>to bust him out?</i>

354
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,312
I don't know.

355
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,047
But my brother
needs help.

356
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,915
You have to find him.

357
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:02,053
(door opens)

358
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,890
It's done.

359
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,889
I have a delivery
for you.

360
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,893
I'll take that.

361
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,834
Oh.

362
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,836
Who sent this, anyway?

363
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:52,570
Who cares?

364
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,905
Hmm.

365
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,840
(timer ticking)

366
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:57,842
Wait a second.

367
00:17:57,844 --> 00:17:59,177
You hear that?

368
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:01,245
Sounds like ticking.

369
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,582
(timer dings)

370
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,651
(explosion booming,
men screaming)

371
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,700
Good morning.

372
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,769
Uh-huh.

373
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,539
How'd you sleep?
Your house makes noise.

374
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,974
It's old.

375
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:32,944
You didn't come here with much.

376
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,045
If you want, alfred can
buy you some clothes.

377
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:37,014
Pass.

378
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,621
Detective gordon told me
you live on the streets.

379
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,890
Yeah.

380
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:47,291
So?

381
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,926
What's it like?

382
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:51,362
Not as nice as here.

383
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,131
Do you live alone?

384
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:56,167
Are you going to ask me
questions all morning?

385
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,138
Aren't you supposed to be
in school or something?

386
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,173
I'm developing
my own curriculum.

387
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,176
It lets me move at my own speed

388
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:06,978
And focus on academic areas
that interest me.

389
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,980
Why?

390
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,448
You're a billionaire,
what's to learn?

391
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,883
That's a strange attitude.

392
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,290
So, where are your parents?

393
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,261
They alive?

394
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,263
Um...

395
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:27,231
Sure.

396
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:28,833
They're around.

397
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,868
Where?

398
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,370
What's that to you?

399
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:33,404
Nothing, I just thought...

400
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,239
Yeah, well, you thought wrong.

401
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,509
I'm not an orphan.

402
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,578
I got family all over.

403
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,790
This was bad enough when it
was just a prison escape.

404
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,458
Now we've got five
dead security guards,

405
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,361
And the press is calling
hargrove an urban terrorist.

406
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,363
Did you get anything
from the bombing site?

407
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,932
Bullock: Forensics is still
looking into it,

408
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:03,000
But the entire office
was destroyed.

409
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,902
Gordon:
Including all security footage.

410
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,204
Yeah.

411
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,306
We do know that hargrove
and his guys made off

412
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,341
With a compound
called hmx.

413
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:11,809
Gordon:
It's military grade.

414
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:13,511
Ten times more powerful
than c-4.

415
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:14,812
Nasty stuff.

416
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,314
Using explosives

417
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:17,515
To steal explosives.

418
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:18,683
What's that about?

419
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:20,618
Trading up?

420
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,886
He must have
another target in mind.

421
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:22,920
Some place difficult to crack.

422
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:24,255
You know what I'm gonna say.

423
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:26,390
So, go, do it.

424
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,459
(cell phone ringing)

425
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,164
This is gordon.

426
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,465
Alfred:
Yes, detective.

427
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,467
It's alfred.

428
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,169
Alfred, is everything all right?

429
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:39,403
Is selina okay?

430
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,805
Well, she's safe.

431
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,807
But?

432
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:46,143
But I'm afraid, detective,
this isn't gonna work out.

433
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:49,146
She's a... A tough nut,
this one.

434
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:50,848
Well, look, we need her help

435
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,850
If we have any chance
of catching the waynes' killer.

436
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:55,553
Just hold onto her for now,
and I'll be out to check on her

437
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:57,088
As soon as I can.

438
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,157
We shall patiently await
your arrival,

439
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,626
Detective.

440
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,064
Everything good?

441
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:10,067
Right as rain.

442
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:12,169
You sure you want to go
through with this?

443
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:15,239
Butch, don't you go getting
scared on me now.

444
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:16,841
Never, boss.

445
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:18,142
(door opens)

446
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,015
Oswald, you're back.

447
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:25,850
(chuckling)

448
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:28,452
I'm starting to think
you enjoy being hurt.

449
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,021
(chuckles)

450
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:31,455
I was passing by.

451
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,590
Thought I'd say hello.

452
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:35,126
Well, you said it.

453
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,560
Now why are you here?

454
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,598
Honestly, I'm just trying
to be friendly.

455
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,435
(inhales deeply)

456
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,205
(sighs with satisfaction)

457
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:49,540
Lilacs.

458
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:51,375
Mmm.

459
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:53,010
You smell good.

460
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:54,345
You don't.

461
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:58,549
(laughing)

462
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:00,284
Snappy as ever.

463
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:02,820
Oh! (chuckles)

464
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,256
Well, good-bye then.

465
00:22:05,258 --> 00:22:07,258
Sorry you're still
grumpy with me.

466
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,194
But, you know,

467
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:14,031
Reaching out in friendship
is never wrong.

468
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:21,939
Man, that dude's creepy.

469
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,876
Forget him.

470
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:27,945
He's nothing.

471
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,615
Hargrove's contacts
and phone records

472
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:32,850
From before he went
to blackgate.

473
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,418
Uh-huh. Yeah.

474
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:36,620
You all right?

475
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:37,855
Yeah, yeah.

476
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,395
Barbara left.

477
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:46,530
<i>Left</i> left?

478
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:47,732
Yeah.

479
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:49,200
Where'd she go?

480
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:50,534
I don't know.

481
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,437
It's a ploy.

482
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,207
She wants you to set a date.

483
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:57,241
It's a standard move.

484
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:58,309
She'll be back.

485
00:22:58,311 --> 00:22:59,610
Do you play video games?

486
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:03,247
Ed, don't<i> ever</i>
do that again.

487
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:04,648
My apologies, detective.

488
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,417
Do either of you
play video games?

489
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,485
I do, I...

490
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:09,220
(giggles)
I love video games.

491
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:12,356
I find that each one presents
a new challenge, a puzzle.

492
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:14,392
It's a lot like detective work
in that way.

493
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:15,359
Ed.

494
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:16,660
Oh, sorry.

495
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:18,562
Uh, I had a chance
to analyze the shrapnel

496
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:19,630
From the security office.

497
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:20,731
And I found something.

498
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:21,766
It's a nameplate.

499
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:23,567
It was damaged in the bombing,

500
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,269
But you can still
read the information.

501
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:26,904
It's from an abandoned
metal factory

502
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,673
Here in gotham.

503
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,576
That's really good work, ed.

504
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:33,577
Thanks.

505
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,079
Thank<i> you,</i> detective.

506
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:37,314
Let's go check this out.

507
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:05,876
Gcpd!

508
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:07,411
Freeze!

509
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:09,513
Don't shoot!

510
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:11,515
You found the nameplate,
thank god.

511
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:13,551
Bullock:
Is anyone else here?

512
00:24:13,553 --> 00:24:15,653
No, but they'll be back soon.
Please, you got to help me.

513
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:17,922
They broke me out of prison,
they kidnapped me, they told me

514
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:20,658
They'd kill my brother and his
family if I didn't help them.

515
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,726
Who's "they"?
Russians.

516
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:24,495
One of their names
is-is kasyanov.

517
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:25,996
They're planning something
against falcone.

518
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:27,565
Falcone?
Yeah.

519
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:29,533
It's a, it's a big job, a vault.

520
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:31,435
That's why they needed me
to build explosives.

521
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:32,670
(men shouting)

522
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:33,771
Behind you!

523
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:35,005
Get down, get down!

524
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:50,588
(man shouting)

525
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,393
(men shouting)
help me!

526
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,066
(men shouting)

527
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:27,324
Bruce: If you want
to go somewhere,

528
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:28,826
We can call you a taxi.

529
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:32,830
You move quiet.

530
00:25:32,832 --> 00:25:34,732
So do you.

531
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,904
Are you leaving?

532
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:42,940
Thinking about it.

533
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:46,477
I'm sorry if talking
about your family upset you.

534
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:47,912
I wasn't upset.

535
00:25:47,914 --> 00:25:50,014
You seemed kind of upset.

536
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:04,562
That's your mom, huh?

537
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,065
She looks nice.

538
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,833
She was.

539
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:13,804
You saw her...

540
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:16,507
The night she was killed?

541
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:19,977
Uh-huh.

542
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:21,779
And you saw me?

543
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,283
What I did?

544
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:27,751
What I didn't do?

545
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,119
What are you talking about?

546
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:30,688
What could you have done?

547
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,056
I don't know-- something.

548
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:35,659
You're dreaming, kid.

549
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:38,028
A gun's a gun.

550
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:45,102
My mom's in show business.

551
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,805
Oh?

552
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:50,207
Yeah.

553
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:53,243
She sings and dances
and does magic tricks.

554
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:57,281
Gets paid,
like, millions.

555
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:59,283
But that's just a cover.

556
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:01,385
Really, she's a secret agent
for the government.

557
00:27:01,387 --> 00:27:03,854
Wow.

558
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:06,123
Yeah.

559
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:09,126
She's on a secret mission.

560
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:13,330
But when she's done,
she's coming back to get me.

561
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:16,900
That's good.

562
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,639
Yeah.

563
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:24,375
Did you ever kiss a girl?

564
00:27:24,377 --> 00:27:26,844
No.

565
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:28,646
Do you want to?

566
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:30,414
Why-why do you ask?

567
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:33,017
Just curious.

568
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:40,057
Time for your studies,
master bruce.

569
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:44,762
Thank you, alfred.

570
00:27:44,764 --> 00:27:47,498
You're more than welcome
to join, miss kyle.

571
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,834
Right.

572
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:53,237
I'll see you later.

573
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:55,506
Do you have any idea
how many angry phone calls

574
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:57,041
We've been
getting this week?

575
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:58,442
Got a terrorist
out there.

576
00:27:58,444 --> 00:27:59,443
And that's our fault?

577
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:01,211
Jim!

578
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:04,915
No, no, please.

579
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,518
You tell me, detective--

580
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,852
How is this my fault?

581
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,421
Well, for starters,

582
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:12,322
You have the mentally ill
housed at blackgate,

583
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:14,324
A prison with
no facilities for them.

584
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:15,826
So, you send them
out for treatment,

585
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:17,161
Which was exactly where

586
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:18,495
Hargrove was headed
when he was broken out.

587
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,966
I want him found.

588
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:24,068
Yes, sir.

589
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,303
Today.
Yes, sir.

590
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,506
What is wrong with you?

591
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,944
By the way,
hargrove's brother john,

592
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:36,547
I went ahead and put him and his
family in protective custody.

593
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,082
That'll help.

594
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:39,416
Yeah, only problem is--

595
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:41,351
Hargrove doesn't know that.

596
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,955
All right, dent.

597
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:47,891
You dragged me
down here, now what?

598
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,832
I got the last piece
of the puzzle in place.

599
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:56,200
I'm bringing charges
against you.

600
00:28:56,202 --> 00:28:58,469
Oh, that old song again?

601
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:01,105
You will never prove fraud.

602
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:03,674
You know that, and I know that.

603
00:29:03,676 --> 00:29:05,576
Fraud charges are only
part of it.

604
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:08,045
Oh, really?
What, then? Jaywalking?

605
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:10,247
Conspiracy to commit
first-degree murder.

606
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,815
Murder?

607
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:13,383
So, tell me, dent--

608
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:14,818
Who did I kill?

609
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,987
Thomas and martha wayne.

610
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:18,922
(scoffs):
Oh, god...

611
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,358
I have an eyewitness who
can tie you to the crime,

612
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,927
You and all the
others involved.

613
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,929
That's absurd.

614
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,005
Help yourself
out here, dick.

615
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,543
Think about your options.

616
00:29:39,545 --> 00:29:41,411
This is gonna get ugly.

617
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:44,181
(scoffing laugh)

618
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:46,750
You're a fool.

619
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:51,488
And you have no idea who or
what you're even dealing with.

620
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,024
Don't you ever
threaten me!

621
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:57,060
I will rip you open.

622
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:13,043
It was good to see you, dick.

623
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:14,011
Bullock:
<i>Jim!</i>

624
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:15,345
Got it.

625
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:16,580
Yeah?

626
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:18,182
Meet gregor kasyanov.

627
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:19,416
Long rap sheet.

628
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:20,884
Worked for nikolai
before he died.

629
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:22,319
Who does he work for now?

630
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,320
Beats me.

631
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:24,655
All right.

632
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:26,657
Hargrove said it's a big
job, right? A vault.

633
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:28,325
Somebody's got to
be bankrolling it.

634
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,460
Yeah, someone with cash
and pull and beef with falcone.

635
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:32,129
Problem is-- in gotham,

636
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:34,264
Anyone with cash and pull
has beef with falcone.

637
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:35,232
Gordon:
Hmm.

638
00:30:35,234 --> 00:30:36,400
So, who is it?

639
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:54,251
(mooney clicks tongue)

640
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:56,086
You kept me waiting.

641
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:58,522
Ran into a little trouble.

642
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,157
Nothing to worry about.

643
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,793
Good, I've got a lot
riding on this job.

644
00:31:02,795 --> 00:31:04,294
You've said.

645
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:06,597
Mooney:
Your boss nikolai is dead

646
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:08,599
Because of falcone.

647
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:09,967
You want to get back at him,

648
00:31:09,969 --> 00:31:13,003
You hit him where it hurts--
his money.

649
00:31:13,005 --> 00:31:14,304
Ain't that right, butch?

650
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:15,639
Yep.

651
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:17,407
The root of all evil.

652
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:19,176
We'll take his money.

653
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:20,544
No problem.

654
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:23,113
As long as it's there,
like you said.

655
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:25,115
Oh, it's there.

656
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:27,951
I'm positive.

657
00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:29,653
The truck you needed.

658
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:33,490
And gregor...

659
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,760
...Break a leg.

660
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:50,874
(water burbling)

661
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,849
(heart beating)

662
00:31:58,851 --> 00:32:01,051
(heartbeat increases)

663
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,224
(selina scoffs)

664
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:10,727
You're the weirdest
kid I've ever met.

665
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:17,134
Why are you doing that?

666
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:19,503
Training.

667
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:21,138
Oh...

668
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,173
Like the boxing.

669
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:25,842
So, if anyone mugs you
with a diving board,

670
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:27,411
You'll be ready, huh?

671
00:32:27,413 --> 00:32:29,146
Yes.

672
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:31,148
I mean, no.

673
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,317
I'm developing
self-discipline and willpower.

674
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,551
Why?

675
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:36,620
So I can be strong.

676
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:39,790
I get you, but it won't work.

677
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:42,793
Not on the streets,
not in gotham.

678
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:43,894
Why's that?

679
00:32:43,896 --> 00:32:45,662
Out there on the streets,

680
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:46,863
It's not enough to be strong.

681
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:50,167
You gotta be mean.

682
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:52,502
Gotta be ruthless.

683
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:55,706
Do you know what ruthless means?

684
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:57,274
Of course I do.

685
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:58,809
Yeah?

686
00:32:58,811 --> 00:32:59,943
Well, you ain't.

687
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:02,112
You're a nice kid.

688
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:04,748
Five minutes on the street,
you'll be mincemeat.

689
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,317
And holding your breath
won't do a damn thing.

690
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,266
Host: The subject of today's
category is numbers.

691
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:24,267
Here we go.

692
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:26,136
How many bones in the human arm?

693
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:27,137
Thirty-two.

694
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:28,138
Woman:
Thirty-two.

695
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,139
(bell dings)

696
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:30,707
Host:
Correct.

697
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:34,811
Next, how many elements
in the periodic table?

698
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,046
118.

699
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:38,648
Woman:
Uh... 118.

700
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,883
(bell dings)

701
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:41,651
Host:
Yes, again.

702
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:42,886
Now for a tough one.

703
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:46,089
How many eyes are there
on cards in a deck?

704
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:47,090
Forty-two.

705
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:48,358
Woman:
21.

706
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,659
(buzzer sounds)

707
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:51,328
Host:
No, I'm sorry.

708
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:54,264
The number you were
looking for is 42.

709
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:56,099
You forgot to double it
for two eyes.

710
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:57,801
(lively music playing)

711
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,104
(whoops, laughs)

712
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:02,706
Host: Well, that concludes
our show for today.

713
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:03,940
We'd like to thank
all the contestants

714
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:05,842
That participated here in studio

715
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:07,644
And those of you
playing along at home.

716
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:09,646
We'll be back right after this.

717
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:11,148
Bullock:
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

718
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,315
What about the explosives?

719
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:14,651
It-it's a very
specific type.

720
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:16,186
It's highly volatile,

721
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:18,088
And it's very difficult
to manufacture.

722
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:21,124
It's for one use,
and one use only.

723
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:22,759
To penetrate iron.

724
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:24,161
Like a vault
in a bank.

725
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:25,629
Mm-mm, no, they're all steel.

726
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:27,264
No one makes anything
out of iron anymore.

727
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:29,266
Not for...
A hundred years, at least.

728
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:31,334
The gotham armory.

729
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:32,602
Yeah.

730
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:34,004
Yeah, they have
those iron vaults

731
00:34:34,006 --> 00:34:35,472
They used to keep
the gunpowder in.

732
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:36,873
A few years ago,

733
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:38,241
A private investment
group bought it.

734
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,043
Ten to one,
falcone's behind it.

735
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:43,113
Hmm...? Do you...?

736
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:53,323
How much longer?

737
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:55,592
It's ready.

738
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:17,647
It didn't work.

739
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,688
(laughter echoing)

740
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:28,825
Hey, hey...

741
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:30,460
Promise me nobody else
is gonna get hurt.

742
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:31,461
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

743
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:32,462
Sure, no problem.

744
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,597
Cross my heart.

745
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,081
You're surrounded!

746
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:51,915
(sirens approaching)

747
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:53,083
There's no way out!

748
00:35:53,085 --> 00:35:54,518
(sirens whooping)

749
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,753
Drop your weapons!

750
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:58,788
Kasyanov:
Don't do it! Get back!

751
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:01,291
Hargrove!

752
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,327
Ian hargrove!

753
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,163
Your brother
and his family are safe.

754
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:07,931
We have them in
protective custody.

755
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:10,700
Kasyanov:
If he runs, shoot him!

756
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:11,768
Don't shoot!

757
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:12,903
Man: You shoot him,
they shoot us!

758
00:36:12,905 --> 00:36:14,971
Drop your weapons!

759
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:24,281
(cell phone ringtone playing)

760
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,485
Get away from the truck!

761
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:29,486
Everybody down!

762
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,258
Why'd you do that?

763
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,859
Bet you can't hit me.

764
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:11,661
I could.

765
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:12,862
But why would I want to?

766
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:13,997
Try.

767
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:14,998
What for?

768
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,935
Hit me, and...

769
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:20,837
Hmm...

770
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,839
I'll let you kiss me.

771
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,714
Ha!

772
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,288
You didn't get me.

773
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,156
Ah, no!

774
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:48,298
Oh!
(laughing)

775
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,639
(bruce shouting playfully)

776
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,777
(cell phone ringing)

777
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,215
Gordon:
Morning, alfred.

778
00:38:05,217 --> 00:38:06,650
Ah, detective.

779
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:08,084
I've been trying
to get out there.

780
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:09,619
I'm sorry, uh...
Is everything okay?

781
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:10,987
Is she behaving herself?

782
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:13,323
Well, uh, not really, no.

783
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:14,524
That's all right.

784
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:15,825
It is?

785
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:17,060
Yes, well, she's...

786
00:38:17,062 --> 00:38:20,096
A breath of fresh air,
I might say.

787
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:22,532
Glad to hear it.

788
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:24,901
I'll be out there
as-as soon as I can.

789
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:27,537
Very good, sir.

790
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,946
(surprised gasp)

791
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:38,948
Oh...

792
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,317
Forgive me for the intrusion,

793
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:42,052
But it's urgent
that I speak with you.

794
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:44,954
(laughs)

795
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:46,356
You know who I am.

796
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:48,792
Yeah.

797
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:51,227
And falcone would kill you
if he knew you were here.

798
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:54,964
Perhaps.

799
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:56,966
What would he do if I told him

800
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:59,269
That you were spying
on him for fish mooney?

801
00:38:59,271 --> 00:39:01,538
You don't have any proof.

802
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,107
No.

803
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:10,413
But suspicion,
it's a funny thing.

804
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:12,082
Hmm?

805
00:39:12,084 --> 00:39:14,984
Falcone might not choose
to believe me at first,

806
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:17,087
But every time
he looked at you,

807
00:39:17,089 --> 00:39:21,057
He'd ask himself-- is she?

808
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:22,926
Could she?

809
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:24,427
Would she?

810
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:26,062
You're wrong.

811
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:27,364
He cares about me.

812
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:30,567
Let's call him and find out,
shall we?

813
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:35,305
(keypad beeping)

814
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:37,507
Stop!

815
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:50,854
Your secret is safe with me.

816
00:39:50,856 --> 00:39:53,957
I won't tell,

817
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:56,359
Because you...

818
00:39:56,361 --> 00:40:00,864
Are gonna keep working for fish.

819
00:40:00,866 --> 00:40:04,534
And you are not going
to tell anyone.

820
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:06,603
Or you'll die.

821
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:11,274
Gordon:
Messages for gordon.

822
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:13,343
Thanks.

823
00:40:13,345 --> 00:40:15,378
Jim.
You have a minute?

824
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,080
Uh, yeah.

825
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,085
I met with lovecraft.

826
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:23,119
How'd it go?

827
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:24,120
He was scared.

828
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:25,555
He's involved, all right.

829
00:40:25,557 --> 00:40:27,924
Scared isn't proof.
You didn't see him.

830
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,126
Told the same story
in a few other spots.

831
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:31,294
All the big players
will know by now,

832
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:32,295
Someone will start talking.

833
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:33,963
If and when they do,

834
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:35,665
Neither of us makes a move
without talking first.

835
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:36,966
We move together on this.

836
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:38,535
Absolutely.

837
00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:39,936
Hey, nice work
on the hargrove case.

838
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,137
You saved the poor
guy's life.

839
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:42,672
You're a regular saint.
Thanks.

840
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:44,140
Uh, we'll be talking
again soon, I hope.

841
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:45,608
You bet.

842
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,976
Thanks, counselor.

843
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,579
Finish up with hargrove?

844
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:51,581
Yeah.

845
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:53,082
He's on his way to arkham.

846
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:54,284
Arkham?

847
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:56,152
Mayor's directive.

848
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:58,054
He's taking all the criminally
insane inmates from blackgate,

849
00:40:58,056 --> 00:40:59,389
Sending them to arkham,

850
00:40:59,391 --> 00:41:01,090
So they can get
appropriate treatment.

851
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:02,559
That's nuts.

852
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:04,360
Appropriate tr...
The building's 200 years old.

853
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:06,162
Welcome to gotham.

854
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:08,064
Oh, and get this--
hargrove said that the bomb

855
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:09,566
That blew up the money
wasn't his.

856
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:12,268
Whose was it?
He didn't know.

857
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,610
How did it go?

858
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:22,111
Cops were everywhere.

859
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:24,314
Our guys had
no way out.

860
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,015
I had to make
the call.

861
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:27,283
Is everybody dead?

862
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:29,052
Gregor? All his men?

863
00:41:29,054 --> 00:41:30,987
Every last one.

864
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,956
Good.

865
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:34,958
I can't stand loose strings.

866
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,359
You're not mad?

867
00:41:36,361 --> 00:41:38,228
That's a hell of a lot
of money we just lost.

868
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,529
Mad?

869
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:41,498
I couldn't be happier.

870
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,733
The point wasn't to steal
that money, butch.

871
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:45,535
It was to hurt falcone.

872
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:50,006
Well, that you did, fish.

873
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,407
That you did.

874
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:52,642
Good afternoon, everyone.

875
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,744
Thank you all for coming.

876
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:56,980
As you well know,

877
00:41:56,982 --> 00:41:58,381
The people of gotham

878
00:41:58,383 --> 00:42:01,718
<i>Have been shaken</i>
<i>by tragedy in recent days,</i>

879
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:06,389
<i>Tragedy no citizen</i>
<i>should have to endure.</i>

880
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:09,592
<i>What has happened these past</i>
<i>few days is a direct result</i>

881
00:42:09,594 --> 00:42:13,162
<i>Of gotham's criminally</i>
<i>insane not getting</i>

882
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:17,600
<i>The appropriate treatment</i>
<i>and help that we owe them.</i>

883
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:20,036
<i>That is why I am moving</i>
<i>forward with plans</i>

884
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:23,940
<i>To turn the recently</i>
<i>renovated arkham asylum</i>

885
00:42:23,942 --> 00:42:25,842
<i>Into a remedial facility...</i>

886
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:27,410
All right, let's go,
here, man; let's go.

887
00:42:27,412 --> 00:42:29,546
<i>...For the criminally insane.</i>

888
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:33,650
Gordon:
<i>Barbara...</i>

889
00:42:33,652 --> 00:42:35,451
It's me.

890
00:42:35,453 --> 00:42:38,021
I got your letter, and I, um...

891
00:42:38,023 --> 00:42:42,859
I know you said you needed
some time away from gotham.

892
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:44,928
From me.

893
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,964
But I want you to come back.

894
00:42:47,966 --> 00:42:52,602
I need you... To come back.

895
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:55,972
I don't have anything
without you.

896
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:01,010
And I love you.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
