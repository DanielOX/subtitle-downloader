1
00:00:00,973 --> 00:00:03,913
There's a war coming, a terrible war.

2
00:00:03,947 --> 00:00:05,548
There will be chaos.

3
00:00:05,582 --> 00:00:06,683
Rivers of blood in the streets.

4
00:00:06,717 --> 00:00:07,884
I know it.

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:09,052
I-I can see it coming.

6
00:00:09,086 --> 00:00:10,687
It's time.

7
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:13,823
Somebody has to take over.
It might as well be me.

8
00:00:15,693 --> 00:00:18,261
I'm looking for a connection
between the Arkham plan

9
00:00:18,295 --> 00:00:19,495
and the murders of my parents.

10
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:20,530
If Maroni gets even

11
00:00:20,564 --> 00:00:22,598
a piece of Arkham,

12
00:00:22,633 --> 00:00:24,200
it will prove Falcone is weak.

13
00:00:24,234 --> 00:00:26,536
Don't ever come back to Gotham.

14
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,038
Hello, James, old friend.

15
00:00:29,073 --> 00:00:30,573
I told you never to come back here!

16
00:00:30,607 --> 00:00:32,375
Nobody looks for a dead man.

17
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:35,345
- So, you want the job or what?
- Yes.

18
00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:37,447
I ain't looking for no girl.

19
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:38,614
I'm looking for a weapon.

20
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:40,049
Falcone thinks he can hit me,

21
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:41,784
in my place of business,

22
00:00:41,819 --> 00:00:42,719
and get away with it?

23
00:00:42,753 --> 00:00:43,886
I want to hit him back.

24
00:00:53,664 --> 00:00:54,931
Fancy a stroll?

25
00:00:54,965 --> 00:00:57,800
It's a lovely day.

26
00:00:57,835 --> 00:01:00,336
Stretch the legs, breath of fresh air.

27
00:01:00,371 --> 00:01:01,704
Busy.

28
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,875
I've got a question for you, Master Bruce.

29
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,078
What if all this was a complete

30
00:01:09,113 --> 00:01:11,281
and utter bloody waste of time?

31
00:01:12,683 --> 00:01:15,285
What if you never discovered
who killed your mom and dad?

32
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:18,655
Hmm?

33
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,226
What if you never get to wreak revenge?

34
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,462
I don't want revenge.

35
00:01:26,497 --> 00:01:29,232
I want to understand how it all works.

36
00:01:29,266 --> 00:01:30,600
How Gotham works.

37
00:01:30,634 --> 00:01:32,035
Well, you'd have more chance

38
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:34,003
digging to China with a teaspoon.

39
00:01:34,038 --> 00:01:35,905
Take the Arkham project for instance.

40
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,974
How did the Falcone and Maroni

41
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:40,610
crime families get such
big shares in the deal?

42
00:01:40,644 --> 00:01:41,911
I mean,

43
00:01:41,946 --> 00:01:43,479
I know City Hall is corrupt,

44
00:01:43,514 --> 00:01:46,816
but why didn't Wayne
Enterprises do something?

45
00:01:48,152 --> 00:01:50,119
Can you pass me that
blue folder over there?

46
00:01:54,158 --> 00:01:57,026
Well, I suppose as hobbies go,

47
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:59,162
this is damn sight better

48
00:01:59,196 --> 00:02:02,999
than grilling yourself
like a bloody pork chop.

49
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:05,468
Still, not particularly healthy, is it?

50
00:02:05,502 --> 00:02:07,704
Thank you.

51
00:02:07,738 --> 00:02:11,040
Are you listening to me?

52
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:12,609
Y-Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

53
00:02:12,643 --> 00:02:15,144
I'll take a walk later. Thank you, Alfred.

54
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,686
I won a piece of Arkham.

55
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:25,388
I strong-armed the mayor.

56
00:02:25,422 --> 00:02:26,956
I made Falcone back down.

57
00:02:26,991 --> 00:02:30,159
And you're telling me that
I can't rob a lousy casino?

58
00:02:30,194 --> 00:02:33,963
Sal, the casino is Falcone's pride and joy.

59
00:02:33,998 --> 00:02:35,531
I mean, what's the point?

60
00:02:35,566 --> 00:02:37,433
For a few thousand bucks,
why mess with Falcone?

61
00:02:37,468 --> 00:02:39,135
That's the point.

62
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:40,803
Messing with Falcone.

63
00:02:40,838 --> 00:02:42,906
I want him and his people to
know we're not backing off.

64
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,008
Arkham was only the beginning.

65
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:46,676
We're taking over, Frankie.

66
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,177
Inch by inch.

67
00:02:48,212 --> 00:02:50,446
- Okay, but...
- But, but, but!

68
00:02:50,481 --> 00:02:53,449
- Make it happen.
- Okay, boss.

69
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:04,027
What are you looking at?
You got something to say?

70
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:07,096
No, sir. Nothing at all.

71
00:03:19,877 --> 00:03:22,212
Here you go, buddy.

72
00:03:46,003 --> 00:03:47,136
Hey!

73
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:49,038
Hey, man!

74
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:51,100
Hey!

75
00:04:53,237 --> 00:04:55,171
Hey! You got to pay for that!

76
00:04:57,608 --> 00:05:01,478
Do not vex me, mortal.

77
00:05:01,512 --> 00:05:02,846
Yeah?

78
00:05:04,582 --> 00:05:06,583
Suit yourself, Zeus.

79
00:05:18,062 --> 00:05:21,698
Hey, might look like the
heel of a hobo's shoe...

80
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:23,600
best burgers in Midtown. Huh, Ephraim?

81
00:05:23,634 --> 00:05:24,734
If you say so.

82
00:05:24,768 --> 00:05:26,836
All right, I want two cheeseburgers,

83
00:05:26,871 --> 00:05:29,339
uh, hold the sauce, extra
pickles, two malted shakes.

84
00:05:29,373 --> 00:05:30,707
No pickles on mine, please.

85
00:05:30,741 --> 00:05:32,509
Oh, you got to trust me on this one, Jim.

86
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,345
Yeah? All right. Pickles, bring 'em.

87
00:05:43,154 --> 00:05:45,188
All right, now,
you want to look good

88
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:46,523
in a swimsuit like me come summertime,

89
00:05:46,557 --> 00:05:48,925
you're gonna want a lot of
this and a lot of this, huh?

90
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,527
Is that right?

91
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:54,330
You!

92
00:05:54,365 --> 00:05:55,565
Hey!

93
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:06,409
Jim!

94
00:06:06,444 --> 00:06:08,111
Come on, it's lunchtime. Relax!

95
00:06:10,781 --> 00:06:12,415
It's lunchtime!

96
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:16,886
No, Jim. We're on our... It-it's lunch!

97
00:06:16,921 --> 00:06:18,555
Oh, brother.

98
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:22,025
Jim, can't just pop up and
jump every time you hear a bell.

99
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,865
GCPD! Anybody here?

100
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:30,767
Over... over here.

101
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,105
You all right, sir?

102
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:36,506
You okay?

103
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,209
- Thank God you're here.
- Anybody dead?

104
00:06:39,243 --> 00:06:40,510
I don't think so.

105
00:06:40,544 --> 00:06:42,779
Some guy, he was stealing milk.

106
00:06:42,813 --> 00:06:44,047
I try to stop him,

107
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:46,082
he hauls away my ATM machine.

108
00:06:46,117 --> 00:06:47,517
All right, nobody dead.

109
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,419
We're homicide, and it's lunch.

110
00:06:49,453 --> 00:06:51,154
So have a good day, sir.

111
00:06:51,188 --> 00:06:53,089
Call 911, and someone
will take good care of you.

112
00:06:53,124 --> 00:06:55,091
Wait a minute, wait a
minute. One guy did this?

113
00:06:55,126 --> 00:06:56,726
Stole your ATM over milk?

114
00:06:56,761 --> 00:06:59,129
Little skinny-ass dude. Guitar case.

115
00:06:59,163 --> 00:07:01,564
Drinking milk like there's no more cows.

116
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,800
"Don't vex me, mortal," he says.

117
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:05,335
Sorry, what?

118
00:07:05,369 --> 00:07:07,804
Listen, if I had a
dollar for every hobo skeez

119
00:07:07,838 --> 00:07:09,472
that walks through that
door, thinks they're God,

120
00:07:09,507 --> 00:07:11,441
I wouldn't be here.

121
00:07:11,475 --> 00:07:14,544
But this son of a bitch,
he wasn't fooling around.

122
00:07:14,578 --> 00:07:16,880
All right, you get a
description of the vehicle,

123
00:07:16,914 --> 00:07:18,014
license plate, something?

124
00:07:18,049 --> 00:07:19,816
He didn't have a vehicle.

125
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,085
Then how'd he pull your ATM from the wall?

126
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:23,286
How'd he take it away?

127
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,754
That's what I'm telling you, man.

128
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:26,823
He pulled it out of
here with his bare hands.

129
00:07:54,547 --> 00:07:55,981
I'm bored.

130
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,435
Poor little baby girl.

131
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:00,570
Cooped up in here all the time.

132
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:01,905
You want some excitement.

133
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,641
Yes, I do. Can we just go somewhere and...?

134
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,712
How's that? Excited now?

135
00:08:08,746 --> 00:08:10,514
What'd you do that for?

136
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:12,449
Why are you here with me?

137
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,819
I'm your secret weapon.

138
00:08:15,853 --> 00:08:17,387
Exactly.

139
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:20,123
But are you helping me help you?

140
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:21,525
No, you're not.

141
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:23,460
You won't even learn the damn tune.

142
00:08:23,494 --> 00:08:26,363
I told you this is important.

143
00:08:26,397 --> 00:08:28,331
I'm sorry, mama.

144
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:30,066
I'm not your mama.

145
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:34,671
Now, you might be my baby
girl, but I'm not your mama.

146
00:08:34,705 --> 00:08:36,273
Not yet.

147
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:39,276
You have to earn that.

148
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,135
How is that even possible?

149
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,737
- Who is this guy?
- No positive I.D.

150
00:09:07,772 --> 00:09:09,673
As of yet, he's a street guy.

151
00:09:09,707 --> 00:09:10,874
We think that

152
00:09:10,908 --> 00:09:13,710
this thing has something to do with his...

153
00:09:13,744 --> 00:09:15,812
excessive joi de vivre.

154
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,681
Yeah, we found it in the
suspect's guitar case.

155
00:09:17,715 --> 00:09:18,849
It's some kind of drug.

156
00:09:18,883 --> 00:09:21,184
A drug did that?

157
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:22,686
Wow.

158
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,554
Nygma found traces of the drug.

159
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:26,089
He'll have a read on what the hell

160
00:09:26,124 --> 00:09:27,290
this thing is by tomorrow morning.

161
00:09:27,325 --> 00:09:28,992
Meantime, we'll try
and I.D. the strong man.

162
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:29,860
Yeah.

163
00:09:47,145 --> 00:09:49,679
I know your families are upset.

164
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,981
But tell them

165
00:09:51,015 --> 00:09:53,183
everybody got a piece
of the Arkham project.

166
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,818
It was a business decision.

167
00:09:54,852 --> 00:09:56,787
We didn't lose, Maroni didn't win.

168
00:09:56,821 --> 00:09:58,722
Maroni thinks he won.

169
00:09:58,756 --> 00:10:01,057
He thinks he won a great battle.

170
00:10:01,092 --> 00:10:04,094
- We need to hurt him.
- No.

171
00:10:04,128 --> 00:10:06,930
If we don't push back
hard, he's going to think...

172
00:10:06,964 --> 00:10:09,833
Nikolai, that fool will think
what I want him to think.

173
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:11,635
No push back, not yet.

174
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:14,171
In my country, we say,

175
00:10:14,205 --> 00:10:18,842
"Even a fool may bite the
king, if he has teeth."

176
00:10:18,876 --> 00:10:21,178
Can the folklore, Niko.

177
00:10:21,212 --> 00:10:23,513
We're not in your godforsaken country.

178
00:10:23,548 --> 00:10:27,217
We are here in Gotham, where
we have plumbing, electricity,

179
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,352
and Don Falcone is the boss.

180
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:30,754
He's playing

181
00:10:30,788 --> 00:10:33,390
that cluck Maroni on a long line. Done!

182
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,525
Why so angry, Fish?

183
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,861
I speak my mind. Is no crime.

184
00:10:37,895 --> 00:10:40,597
And I assure you, in my country,

185
00:10:40,631 --> 00:10:42,699
we have all modern conveniences.

186
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:44,701
ladies.

187
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:46,236
Ladies are in kitchen or in bed,

188
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,305
depending on their talents.

189
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:50,574
I bet your mother was a lousy cook.

190
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,142
Don't speak of my mother.

191
00:10:52,176 --> 00:10:53,577
Or what?

192
00:10:55,012 --> 00:10:57,314
You gonna hit a lady?

193
00:10:57,348 --> 00:10:58,515
That's enough.

194
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:00,550
There'll be no bad blood here.

195
00:11:00,585 --> 00:11:02,986
My apologies, Don Falcone.

196
00:11:03,021 --> 00:11:04,755
We need each other.

197
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,957
We're family.

198
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,668
Hey.

199
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:22,439
Excuse me. You seen this guy by chance?

200
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,840
Nah.

201
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:24,975
Mm-mm.

202
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:26,476
You seen this guy?

203
00:11:28,012 --> 00:11:29,112
Excuse me.

204
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,516
Familiar to you, hmm?

205
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,484
Any chance you've seen this guy?

206
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:37,621
Yeah, I know him. That's, uh, Benny.

207
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:41,391
He's a guitar player.
Strung out like string.

208
00:11:41,426 --> 00:11:44,394
- What'd he do?
- Uh, nothing bad.

209
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:46,063
Uh, he came into an inheritance actually

210
00:11:46,097 --> 00:11:47,998
- no one knew about.
- That's right.

211
00:11:48,032 --> 00:11:50,767
Million dollars. Farm, horses, real nice.

212
00:11:50,802 --> 00:11:52,369
You know where can we find him?

213
00:11:52,403 --> 00:11:54,204
$20.

214
00:11:55,973 --> 00:11:57,874
Ten.

215
00:11:57,909 --> 00:11:59,743
Same as the bodega.

216
00:11:59,777 --> 00:12:03,180
Yeah, what's with all the dairy products?

217
00:12:08,586 --> 00:12:09,820
Sir?

218
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,456
GCPD. Let me see those hands.

219
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,591
Oh... help me.

220
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,026
I need...

221
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,694
more...

222
00:12:17,729 --> 00:12:19,529
More what? What'd you take?

223
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:22,597
- What is it?
- It's... it felt so good.

224
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,435
And now I-I don't feel so
good. Something's wrong.

225
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,237
I need more!

226
00:12:27,271 --> 00:12:29,706
Please, you have to find him.

227
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:30,774
Find who?

228
00:12:30,808 --> 00:12:32,676
The guy that gave you the stuff? Yeah!

229
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,178
The man with a mangled ear.

230
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,080
The mangled ear. I got him.

231
00:12:37,115 --> 00:12:39,216
Stay calm. We got it. Help me.

232
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,684
We're gonna help. Just put your...

233
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,886
- No, no, no, no!
- Hey, hey! Sir!

234
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,389
Sir, we need you to calm down.

235
00:12:45,423 --> 00:12:46,456
Calm down. Please...

236
00:12:46,491 --> 00:12:47,524
Put your hands behind your back!

237
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:58,302
I said no!

238
00:12:58,336 --> 00:12:59,736
Put it down!

239
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,227
What the hell?

240
00:13:26,297 --> 00:13:29,766
God help us if that drug gets out.

241
00:13:56,408 --> 00:13:58,510
Will you look at this shambles?

242
00:14:01,981 --> 00:14:04,849
What would your mother say?

243
00:14:04,884 --> 00:14:07,318
You know, I have a half a mind to

244
00:14:07,353 --> 00:14:10,488
stick all this lot straight
into the bloody fire.

245
00:14:10,523 --> 00:14:12,857
- No fire.
- We'll see about that.

246
00:14:12,892 --> 00:14:15,126
Come on, up you get.

247
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:17,295
Wayne Enterprises is hosting

248
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:20,131
a charitable luncheon tomorrow.

249
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,700
And I took the liberty of
accepting their kind invitation

250
00:14:22,735 --> 00:14:24,169
on your behalf, Master Bruce.

251
00:14:24,203 --> 00:14:25,770
Good.

252
00:14:25,804 --> 00:14:27,372
Is there breakfast?

253
00:14:27,406 --> 00:14:30,041
Yeah, I'll make you an egg.

254
00:14:30,075 --> 00:14:31,709
Does that mean you'll go?

255
00:14:31,744 --> 00:14:33,578
Yes.

256
00:14:33,612 --> 00:14:36,447
I have some questions I need
to ask the members of the board.

257
00:14:36,482 --> 00:14:39,717
- What kind of questions?
- About Arkham.

258
00:14:39,752 --> 00:14:41,352
It seems very likely those gangsters

259
00:14:41,387 --> 00:14:44,622
were actually given their shares
in Arkham by Wayne Enterprises.

260
00:14:44,657 --> 00:14:47,859
Well, that's how business
is done, isn't it?

261
00:14:47,893 --> 00:14:49,460
Is it?

262
00:14:51,464 --> 00:14:54,098
M-My parents didn't do business that way.

263
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:56,734
- Did they?
- No.

264
00:14:56,769 --> 00:14:58,369
No, they didn't, Master Bruce.

265
00:14:58,404 --> 00:15:00,338
The board might not know, of course.

266
00:15:00,372 --> 00:15:02,841
There's quite a bit of
clever camouflage used.

267
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:06,177
Shell companies, offshore
accounts and so forth.

268
00:15:06,212 --> 00:15:08,746
Right. So, you-you've...

269
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:11,749
learned all that from all this, did you?

270
00:15:13,118 --> 00:15:15,019
Fantastic detective work.

271
00:15:15,054 --> 00:15:17,055
I still, however, want to get the whole lot

272
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:18,890
and chuck it straight in the fire.

273
00:15:18,924 --> 00:15:20,992
Don't put anything in the fire, Alfred.

274
00:15:21,026 --> 00:15:23,428
That's an order.

275
00:15:23,462 --> 00:15:25,463
Right, Master Bruce.

276
00:15:27,466 --> 00:15:29,467
Nothing in the fire.

277
00:15:37,376 --> 00:15:39,544
We are
live in downtown Gotham

278
00:15:39,578 --> 00:15:42,380
where a deadly new drug
has hit the streets.

279
00:15:42,414 --> 00:15:45,750
Nicknamed "Viper," users
of this mystery drug

280
00:15:45,785 --> 00:15:48,386
acquire great strength and
a euphoric sense of power,

281
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,822
but only for a few brief hours.

282
00:15:50,856 --> 00:15:54,292
Then, without exception,
they die a horrible death.

283
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:01,699
Let me out!

284
00:16:05,471 --> 00:16:06,638
Get off me!

285
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:12,777
Let go of me!

286
00:16:16,315 --> 00:16:18,116
Get your crummy hands off me!

287
00:16:23,689 --> 00:16:25,490
It's really quite remarkable.

288
00:16:25,524 --> 00:16:28,827
Viper somehow activates unused DNA.

289
00:16:28,861 --> 00:16:30,395
The body starts to burn calcium

290
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:32,297
from the skeletal system as fuel.

291
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:35,133
Hence the victims' cravings
for milk and cheese.

292
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:38,236
They're desperately trying to
replace the missing calcium.

293
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,138
But they can't consume enough.

294
00:16:40,172 --> 00:16:43,241
Essentially, their bones crumble.

295
00:16:43,275 --> 00:16:44,976
Then they suffocate and die.

296
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,478
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

297
00:16:46,512 --> 00:16:48,446
No. Nobody has. Totally new.

298
00:16:48,481 --> 00:16:50,849
I cannot tell you how
thrilled I am to be...

299
00:16:50,883 --> 00:16:52,350
No new reports for a few hours now.

300
00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:54,719
Maybe they're done. Maybe
they ran out of the stuff.

301
00:16:54,754 --> 00:16:55,720
I doubt it.

302
00:16:55,755 --> 00:16:57,956
Who would put this on the street?

303
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,957
Why?

304
00:16:58,991 --> 00:17:01,159
Th-They're not even selling
it. They're giving it away.

305
00:17:01,193 --> 00:17:03,294
That's how you create demand.

306
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:04,996
For a drug that kills you that fast?

307
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,664
Well, first it makes you king of the world.

308
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:08,032
There'll be takers.

309
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:09,467
There'll be mayhem, that's for sure.

310
00:17:09,502 --> 00:17:10,935
But it's skell-on-skell mayhem.

311
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,370
If we keep the decent citizens indoors

312
00:17:12,405 --> 00:17:14,806
for a couple of weeks, let
the scumbags have at it,

313
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,608
voilà... the end of crime.

314
00:17:16,642 --> 00:17:19,444
Yeah, that's a nice thought. But no.

315
00:17:19,478 --> 00:17:22,047
This stuff seems hard to make, no?

316
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:24,015
Oh, it takes a high level
of technical sophistication.

317
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,717
A state-of-the-art lab made this stuff.

318
00:17:25,751 --> 00:17:28,286
Okay, so who has the biggest
and best lab in the city?

319
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,455
The best is WellZyn.

320
00:17:30,489 --> 00:17:32,123
But this is not them.

321
00:17:32,158 --> 00:17:34,125
They're a subsidiary of Wayne Enterprises.

322
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,061
Multibillion-dollar corporation.

323
00:17:36,095 --> 00:17:37,529
Why would they be doing this?

324
00:17:37,563 --> 00:17:39,998
I don't know, but we might
as well start at the top.

325
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:43,001
Grab her! Grab her!

326
00:17:43,035 --> 00:17:44,402
Come on, here! Let go of me!

327
00:17:44,437 --> 00:17:47,672
Get off me! Get off me!

328
00:17:59,385 --> 00:18:01,386
Fascinating.

329
00:18:02,388 --> 00:18:03,822
Fascinating!

330
00:18:03,856 --> 00:18:05,990
Breaking news. Continued mayhem...

331
00:18:06,025 --> 00:18:08,193
Maybe I should hire that
guy to take the casino.

332
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:10,295
Maybe you should snort
some Viper, grow a pair.

333
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:11,730
Either way, I want that casino taken.

334
00:18:11,764 --> 00:18:13,331
Sure, we'll take it.

335
00:18:13,366 --> 00:18:16,167
I mean, it's tight as
a nut... ten armed guards

336
00:18:16,202 --> 00:18:18,737
blast-proof doors, cameras.

337
00:18:18,771 --> 00:18:21,940
We're gonna lose a few
guys, but we'll take it.

338
00:18:21,974 --> 00:18:24,109
Excuse me, gentlemen.

339
00:18:24,143 --> 00:18:25,910
I couldn't help but
overhear your conversation

340
00:18:25,945 --> 00:18:27,178
regarding the casino.

341
00:18:27,213 --> 00:18:28,847
Go mind your business.

342
00:18:28,881 --> 00:18:30,648
I'm sorry. Of course. So sorry.

343
00:18:30,683 --> 00:18:34,219
No. Tell me, what about the casino?

344
00:18:35,621 --> 00:18:38,556
I know a janitor who runs
the boiler room of the casino.

345
00:18:38,591 --> 00:18:41,526
He could get you inside
quite easily, I believe.

346
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,461
There are access tunnels
that nobody knows about.

347
00:18:43,496 --> 00:18:45,297
Access tunnels?

348
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:47,399
Sit down. Come here.

349
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:50,702
Thank you, sir. A great honor indeed.

350
00:18:50,736 --> 00:18:52,637
What's your name again?

351
00:18:52,672 --> 00:18:54,773
Everyone here calls me Penguin, sir.

352
00:18:54,807 --> 00:18:56,775
You don't like that name, huh?

353
00:18:58,444 --> 00:19:01,112
Yeah, well, you're wrong. It's a good name.

354
00:19:01,147 --> 00:19:03,148
Works for you.

355
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:06,951
So how do you know this man?

356
00:19:06,986 --> 00:19:08,153
The janitor?

357
00:19:08,187 --> 00:19:11,556
- I have connections.
- Reliable, is he?

358
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,792
I think I can persuade him to be.

359
00:19:13,826 --> 00:19:15,927
Boss, this guy is a dishwasher in a suit.

360
00:19:15,962 --> 00:19:17,729
Relax.

361
00:19:17,763 --> 00:19:19,831
Is that right, Penguin?

362
00:19:19,865 --> 00:19:22,100
Are you just a dishwasher?

363
00:19:22,134 --> 00:19:23,802
'Cause I don't get that vibe.

364
00:19:23,836 --> 00:19:26,004
You come off as all humble, but...

365
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:28,239
you got a little player in you, huh?

366
00:19:28,274 --> 00:19:30,942
That's very perceptive
of you, sir.

367
00:19:30,977 --> 00:19:32,844
I guess that's why you're the don.

368
00:19:32,878 --> 00:19:34,846
Well...

369
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,282
I'm not a dishwasher.

370
00:19:37,316 --> 00:19:40,919
And this isn't my first rodeo, so to speak.

371
00:19:43,022 --> 00:19:44,422
So, you've rode some bulls, huh?

372
00:19:44,457 --> 00:19:46,358
- Well...
- I knew it.

373
00:19:46,392 --> 00:19:47,993
Well, tell all, cowboy.

374
00:19:48,027 --> 00:19:51,463
Well, my real name is Oswald Cobblepot.

375
00:19:51,497 --> 00:19:52,464
Mm-hmm.

376
00:19:52,498 --> 00:19:54,332
And I think that once you hear my story,

377
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,801
you'll agree that I could be
a great asset for you, sir.

378
00:19:56,836 --> 00:19:58,203
Hmm.

379
00:19:58,237 --> 00:20:00,171
It's a long, funny story really.

380
00:20:00,206 --> 00:20:03,108
But the headline, just
so you're not surprised...

381
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,710
I used to work for Fish Mooney.

382
00:20:05,745 --> 00:20:07,612
Fish Mooney?

383
00:20:07,647 --> 00:20:09,047
- Hey.
- Yes, sir.

384
00:20:09,081 --> 00:20:11,950
I was privy to many aspects
of the Falcone family business.

385
00:20:11,984 --> 00:20:14,286
Until they tried to kill me.

386
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,520
Yeah, well...

387
00:20:15,554 --> 00:20:17,289
Hello.

388
00:20:17,323 --> 00:20:18,657
Suffice it to say...

389
00:20:21,093 --> 00:20:22,627
That is a funny story.

390
00:20:22,662 --> 00:20:24,129
Mm.

391
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:38,376
I'm Taylor Reece,

392
00:20:38,411 --> 00:20:41,012
general counsel, public
relations for WellZyn.

393
00:20:41,047 --> 00:20:42,647
Good morning, gentlemen.

394
00:20:42,682 --> 00:20:45,350
Thank you for saving us a trip.

395
00:20:45,384 --> 00:20:48,186
We were en route as soon as we
were apprised of your inquiries.

396
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:51,523
WellZyn is committed to
good community relations.

397
00:20:51,557 --> 00:20:52,757
What do you know about Viper?

398
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:54,226
Only what we see on the news.

399
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,028
WellZyn has no connection to this tragedy.

400
00:20:57,063 --> 00:20:58,663
We will vigorously pursue

401
00:20:58,698 --> 00:21:00,498
legal action against any individuals

402
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:02,534
making assertions to the contrary.

403
00:21:02,568 --> 00:21:04,536
Do you think we push a button

404
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,538
or does she just rewind automatically?

405
00:21:06,572 --> 00:21:08,773
We're looking for
an employee of WellZyn's.

406
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:12,244
Male with a severely damaged ear.

407
00:21:13,312 --> 00:21:14,746
Y-Yes.

408
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,049
Full disclosure... that does raise a flag.

409
00:21:24,957 --> 00:21:27,926
That's Stan Potolsky.

410
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,529
He worked for us for several years

411
00:21:30,563 --> 00:21:32,163
as a biochemist.

412
00:21:32,198 --> 00:21:34,199
Uh, primarily personal care products.

413
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:36,301
Shampoos, toothpastes.

414
00:21:36,335 --> 00:21:37,969
So what happened?

415
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:39,771
Well, Stan was frustrated
that he wasn't doing

416
00:21:39,805 --> 00:21:41,106
more important work.

417
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,276
He grew disgruntled and unstable.

418
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,711
We tried to get him help, but he resisted.

419
00:21:46,746 --> 00:21:50,549
Last April, there was an incident.

420
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:54,085
He tried to cut off his own ear

421
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,422
during a disagreement with his supervisor.

422
00:21:58,457 --> 00:21:59,925
Guess it was harder than he thought.

423
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:02,127
We had to let him go.

424
00:22:02,161 --> 00:22:03,728
Last known address?

425
00:22:03,763 --> 00:22:05,497
Well, after he was terminated,

426
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:07,766
he didn't even clear off his desk.

427
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,734
Just disappeared, off the grid.

428
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:12,137
You knew, didn't you?

429
00:22:13,339 --> 00:22:14,639
You knew all along it was him.

430
00:22:14,674 --> 00:22:16,408
That's why you came to see us so fast.

431
00:22:16,442 --> 00:22:18,577
That's incorrect.

432
00:22:18,611 --> 00:22:21,146
Viper can only be produced
in a state-of-the-art lab,

433
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,347
like yours.

434
00:22:22,381 --> 00:22:25,917
Stan Potolsky is a brilliant man,

435
00:22:25,952 --> 00:22:28,987
perfectly capable of building his own lab.

436
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:30,956
But you are more than welcome to examine

437
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,257
our facilities.

438
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,759
With full and proper clearances, of course.

439
00:22:34,794 --> 00:22:36,027
Of course.

440
00:22:36,062 --> 00:22:38,296
We'll get the paperwork started.

441
00:22:40,466 --> 00:22:42,100
Lawyers.

442
00:22:42,135 --> 00:22:43,969
Scumbags, the lot of them.

443
00:22:44,003 --> 00:22:45,103
Yeah, some of them.

444
00:22:45,138 --> 00:22:46,538
Let's go find Stan Potolsky.

445
00:22:46,572 --> 00:22:48,340
What, drive around looking for him?

446
00:22:48,374 --> 00:22:51,443
No. I'll call dispatch,
have them put out an APB.

447
00:22:51,477 --> 00:22:53,078
All right, I'll check with the desk,

448
00:22:53,112 --> 00:22:55,614
see if his name's come up.

449
00:22:55,648 --> 00:22:58,617
- Gordon, right?
- Yeah. Who the hell are you?

450
00:22:58,651 --> 00:23:01,052
You got to come with me
now, nice and quiet like.

451
00:23:01,087 --> 00:23:02,187
What are you talking about?

452
00:23:02,221 --> 00:23:03,822
Relax. We got a mutual friend.

453
00:23:03,856 --> 00:23:07,225
- Oh, yeah, who's that?
- Oswald Cobblepot.

454
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,828
Yeah, him.

455
00:23:09,862 --> 00:23:11,363
And if you don't come with me now,

456
00:23:11,397 --> 00:23:12,931
we're gonna put his head in a bag

457
00:23:12,965 --> 00:23:14,666
and send it to Falcone,

458
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,902
which would be embarrassing for you, no?

459
00:23:18,905 --> 00:23:20,272
Or maybe we've been misinformed.

460
00:23:20,306 --> 00:23:22,474
I mean, if I'm not ringing any bells here,

461
00:23:22,508 --> 00:23:25,710
you can go on your merry way.

462
00:23:25,745 --> 00:23:28,346
No, I'll come.

463
00:23:36,622 --> 00:23:38,623
Come on, shove over.

464
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,626
Hey! Hey!

465
00:23:57,942 --> 00:23:59,276
Welcome.

466
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,178
I'm Salvatore Maroni.

467
00:24:01,212 --> 00:24:03,580
I know who you are.

468
00:24:03,614 --> 00:24:04,848
What do you want?

469
00:24:04,882 --> 00:24:05,849
Here's the thing...

470
00:24:05,883 --> 00:24:07,651
Jim, just tell the truth.

471
00:24:10,021 --> 00:24:11,788
You want a drink, Jim?

472
00:24:11,823 --> 00:24:13,190
I'm having a Negroni.

473
00:24:13,224 --> 00:24:14,624
So good with seafood.

474
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:16,827
Water.

475
00:24:21,732 --> 00:24:24,301
So, our friend here told
me a fascinating story.

476
00:24:24,335 --> 00:24:25,869
Never heard a story so good.

477
00:24:25,903 --> 00:24:27,471
It's hard to believe it's true.

478
00:24:27,505 --> 00:24:30,207
- It is, it's true.
- Shut up! Shut up!

479
00:24:30,241 --> 00:24:32,409
One more word,

480
00:24:32,443 --> 00:24:34,678
and I'll jam this down your throat.

481
00:24:34,712 --> 00:24:36,379
I try to be civil, Jim.

482
00:24:37,815 --> 00:24:41,418
But I'm not the kind of
man that likes to ask twice.

483
00:24:41,452 --> 00:24:43,186
So here's how it's gonna go.

484
00:24:43,221 --> 00:24:45,322
Slow down, Mr. Maroni. I don't know...

485
00:24:45,356 --> 00:24:46,990
No! No. No.

486
00:24:47,024 --> 00:24:50,360
You let me finish. You'll
have your turn to speak.

487
00:24:52,964 --> 00:24:55,665
Okay, then.

488
00:24:57,068 --> 00:25:00,036
I want you to tell me the same exact story

489
00:25:00,071 --> 00:25:01,772
that Penguin told me.

490
00:25:01,806 --> 00:25:03,240
What story is that?

491
00:25:03,274 --> 00:25:05,442
Oh, you better know what story, my friend.

492
00:25:05,476 --> 00:25:08,311
Because if you tell me
the same story he told me,

493
00:25:08,346 --> 00:25:10,247
then I could believe it's true.

494
00:25:10,281 --> 00:25:12,415
Then I'm happy.

495
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,418
But if you tell me another story, oh, mama.

496
00:25:15,453 --> 00:25:17,020
Then someone's lying to me.

497
00:25:17,922 --> 00:25:20,457
And I don't know which one,
and the both of youse will die.

498
00:25:20,491 --> 00:25:22,692
Understand?

499
00:25:22,727 --> 00:25:25,228
- Yes, I do.
- Good.

500
00:25:25,263 --> 00:25:26,363
So...

501
00:25:28,032 --> 00:25:30,634
Tell me a story, Jim.

502
00:25:33,604 --> 00:25:35,672
Somebody murdered Thomas and Martha Wayne.

503
00:25:35,706 --> 00:25:37,774
My partner and I caught the case.

504
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:38,909
We didn't even know each other then...

505
00:25:38,943 --> 00:25:39,943
What did I say?!

506
00:25:39,977 --> 00:25:42,078
Go put him on the slicer.

507
00:25:42,113 --> 00:25:44,548
No, no, no.

508
00:25:44,582 --> 00:25:47,818
If I don't like what I
hear, slice his face prejute.

509
00:25:49,153 --> 00:25:52,222
Oh, I'm sorry. Go on.

510
00:25:54,926 --> 00:25:58,161
I was a pawn...

511
00:25:58,196 --> 00:26:00,130
in a conspiracy

512
00:26:00,164 --> 00:26:03,767
between Falcone, the mayor and the GCPD

513
00:26:03,801 --> 00:26:06,970
to frame Mario Pepper
for the Wayne murders,

514
00:26:07,004 --> 00:26:08,538
with the help of Fish Mooney,

515
00:26:08,573 --> 00:26:11,775
Mr. Cobblepot's employer at the time.

516
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:15,679
Mr. Cobblepot then told
the whole story to the MCU.

517
00:26:17,982 --> 00:26:19,883
To prove that I wouldn't
betray the conspiracy,

518
00:26:19,917 --> 00:26:21,918
Falcone ordered me to kill Cobblepot.

519
00:26:24,422 --> 00:26:27,357
I didn't do it.

520
00:26:27,391 --> 00:26:29,860
I let him live.

521
00:26:29,894 --> 00:26:32,129
And here we are.

522
00:26:37,301 --> 00:26:39,603
Falcone, Mooney,

523
00:26:39,637 --> 00:26:42,139
the MCU cops...

524
00:26:42,173 --> 00:26:43,807
none of them know he's alive?

525
00:26:43,841 --> 00:26:45,709
If they did, I'd be dead already.

526
00:26:51,182 --> 00:26:52,749
It's delicious.

527
00:26:54,052 --> 00:26:57,320
Frankie! Bring the Penguin back out here.

528
00:26:57,355 --> 00:26:59,122
The little punk is telling the truth.

529
00:26:59,157 --> 00:27:00,557
Thank you, Jim.

530
00:27:00,591 --> 00:27:03,393
Good story. Told well.

531
00:27:03,428 --> 00:27:05,862
Lot of guys in your
situation, they freak out.

532
00:27:07,532 --> 00:27:08,665
There you are, you rat,

533
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,435
you snitch, you gorgeous
turncoat son of a bitch.

534
00:27:11,469 --> 00:27:13,036
Come here, I love you. Mwah!

535
00:27:13,071 --> 00:27:14,371
Be happy, Frankie.

536
00:27:14,405 --> 00:27:16,840
We just got a brand-new
weapon against the Falcones.

537
00:27:16,874 --> 00:27:18,041
It's Christmas!

538
00:27:18,076 --> 00:27:19,776
Happy holidays. Can I go now?

539
00:27:19,811 --> 00:27:21,978
Oh, yeah, Jim, you can go.

540
00:27:23,781 --> 00:27:25,882
You know, just so that we, uh,

541
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:27,384
understand each other,

542
00:27:27,418 --> 00:27:30,053
you know, keep all this hush-hush.

543
00:27:30,088 --> 00:27:32,289
Between us pals.

544
00:27:32,323 --> 00:27:35,425
And if I need you again, I'll call you.

545
00:27:38,196 --> 00:27:40,697
You do that.

546
00:27:44,135 --> 00:27:45,335
Look at you, come on.

547
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,370
Let's get you cleaned up.

548
00:27:46,404 --> 00:27:47,437
Look at you. Come on.

549
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:54,044
I love you, baby.

550
00:27:54,078 --> 00:27:56,413
I love you, baby.

551
00:27:56,447 --> 00:27:58,348
I love you, baby. Okay, now,

552
00:27:58,383 --> 00:28:00,450
you're still putting too much sex on it.

553
00:28:00,485 --> 00:28:02,452
Keep it clean.

554
00:28:02,487 --> 00:28:05,756
Like a mother.

555
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,858
I love you, baby.

556
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,261
I love you, baby.

557
00:28:11,295 --> 00:28:12,529
Good.

558
00:28:12,563 --> 00:28:14,031
Better.

559
00:28:14,065 --> 00:28:17,801
Now, act as if you've caught me in a lie.

560
00:28:19,237 --> 00:28:20,904
Not angry.

561
00:28:20,938 --> 00:28:24,207
No. Disappointment.

562
00:28:25,877 --> 00:28:27,911
Oh, honey.

563
00:28:28,913 --> 00:28:30,781
Oh, honey.

564
00:28:30,815 --> 00:28:32,916
There you go.

565
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:35,452
Now, about your hair.

566
00:28:37,855 --> 00:28:39,823
There you are.

567
00:28:41,893 --> 00:28:44,227
Where the hell have you been?

568
00:28:44,262 --> 00:28:45,862
Personal business.

569
00:28:45,897 --> 00:28:47,798
You disappear in the middle of a case,

570
00:28:47,832 --> 00:28:49,266
you can't even tell me why?

571
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,834
That's what "personal" means.

572
00:28:50,868 --> 00:28:53,003
You in some kind of trouble?

573
00:28:53,037 --> 00:28:54,905
Look, forget it. I don't
want to know your problems.

574
00:28:54,939 --> 00:28:56,473
WellZyn sent by Potolsky's stuff.

575
00:28:56,507 --> 00:28:58,909
- Grab a box.
- Anything useful yet?

576
00:28:58,943 --> 00:29:01,311
No. Classic geeky loner.

577
00:29:01,346 --> 00:29:02,679
Lived for his work.

578
00:29:02,714 --> 00:29:06,850
No wife, no family, no real friends.

579
00:29:06,884 --> 00:29:08,652
Is it Barbara?

580
00:29:09,621 --> 00:29:11,321
She get into something?

581
00:29:11,356 --> 00:29:12,889
Uh, yeah.

582
00:29:12,924 --> 00:29:14,458
Kind of.

583
00:29:14,492 --> 00:29:16,927
Figures. No offense.

584
00:29:16,961 --> 00:29:20,030
- Need any help?
- No, I'm all right, thanks.

585
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,034
Hey.

586
00:29:24,902 --> 00:29:26,403
What do you think about this?

587
00:29:26,437 --> 00:29:27,838
Looks like a friend, no?

588
00:29:32,176 --> 00:29:35,779
Judging by the books and the mascot,

589
00:29:35,813 --> 00:29:36,880
philosophy professor,

590
00:29:36,914 --> 00:29:39,216
Gotham U.

591
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,617
Worth a shot.

592
00:29:40,652 --> 00:29:42,619
Amen.

593
00:29:46,491 --> 00:29:49,026
I was just on my way to an appointment,

594
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,828
but yes, I know Stan Potolsky.

595
00:29:51,863 --> 00:29:53,563
He was a student of mine.

596
00:29:53,598 --> 00:29:56,333
A very brilliant student.

597
00:29:56,367 --> 00:29:58,435
And you've stayed
in touch over the years.

598
00:29:58,469 --> 00:30:01,171
We have. He may be a biochemist,

599
00:30:01,205 --> 00:30:03,640
but philosophy is a passion of his.

600
00:30:03,675 --> 00:30:06,543
What can you tell us
about WellZyn firing him?

601
00:30:06,577 --> 00:30:10,647
Research for WellZyn led him
into some dark moral corners.

602
00:30:10,682 --> 00:30:12,449
WellZyn said he made shampoo.

603
00:30:12,483 --> 00:30:14,217
Where are the dark moral corners in that?

604
00:30:14,252 --> 00:30:18,355
Shampoo?  They say that, do they?

605
00:30:18,389 --> 00:30:22,559
No, no, Stan designed
pharmaceutical weapons

606
00:30:22,594 --> 00:30:24,728
to be used by combat troops.

607
00:30:24,762 --> 00:30:27,164
Drugs that worked on an epigenetic level.

608
00:30:27,198 --> 00:30:28,632
Imagine an army

609
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:31,835
made up of soldiers so strong
that they can tear a man apart

610
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:33,537
with their bare hands.

611
00:30:33,571 --> 00:30:36,707
Of course, at the beginning,
there were side effects.

612
00:30:36,741 --> 00:30:38,242
Yeah, death.

613
00:30:38,276 --> 00:30:39,610
But Viper was the first batch.

614
00:30:39,644 --> 00:30:42,012
They worked out the kinks
in the second version.

615
00:30:42,046 --> 00:30:43,347
Called it Venom.

616
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:50,053
By then, Stan had acquired some clarity.

617
00:30:51,155 --> 00:30:55,058
He appealed to his
bosses to end the program.

618
00:30:55,093 --> 00:30:58,161
They refused, so he went over their heads

619
00:30:58,196 --> 00:31:00,197
to Thomas and Martha Wayne.

620
00:31:01,466 --> 00:31:04,067
He convinced them to shut it down.

621
00:31:04,102 --> 00:31:05,602
And when they died,

622
00:31:05,637 --> 00:31:07,838
WellZyn immediately revived the program

623
00:31:07,872 --> 00:31:10,173
with the blessings of Wayne Enterprises.

624
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:11,542
In the end, there was nothing

625
00:31:11,576 --> 00:31:15,312
for Stan to do but to resort
to more radical measures.

626
00:31:15,346 --> 00:31:16,647
Killing people.

627
00:31:16,681 --> 00:31:19,383
I'm not hearing a sense of
moral outrage, Professor.

628
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:22,286
If you don't mind, I'll
reserve my moral outrage

629
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,488
for the true villains of this piece.

630
00:31:24,522 --> 00:31:26,089
You mean WellZyn.

631
00:31:26,124 --> 00:31:29,393
You planned this with Potolsky.

632
00:31:29,427 --> 00:31:31,295
- Yes.
- Where is he?

633
00:31:31,329 --> 00:31:32,796
Talk fast, bub!

634
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,432
Oh, what are you gonna do to
me? I'm an old man! I'm dying.

635
00:31:35,466 --> 00:31:37,834
I'll help you die quicker, you terrorist.

636
00:31:37,869 --> 00:31:39,069
Soon, Stan will issue a statement

637
00:31:39,103 --> 00:31:40,571
the world won't be able to ignore.

638
00:31:40,605 --> 00:31:41,905
Soon?

639
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,807
- Today?
- You're already too late.

640
00:31:43,842 --> 00:31:45,309
- Now, you tell us where he is right now.
- Wait a minute!

641
00:31:45,343 --> 00:31:47,144
Wait a minute! You said you
had an appointment, right?

642
00:31:47,178 --> 00:31:48,145
Where were you going?

643
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:51,281
Bravo! You've asked the right question.

644
00:31:51,316 --> 00:31:54,184
The first step to enlightenment.

645
00:32:03,294 --> 00:32:05,262
No!

646
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,673
Where is he?!

647
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:18,542
- Where's Potolsky?!
- Those hypocrites.

648
00:32:18,576 --> 00:32:21,278
Empty altruism will not
erase what they've done.

649
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,547
They must pay.

650
00:32:23,581 --> 00:32:25,849
- Who? Who must pay?
- WellZyn.

651
00:32:25,884 --> 00:32:27,484
Wayne Enterprises.

652
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,020
Everyone will finally

653
00:32:30,054 --> 00:32:32,222
- see them for what they are.
- How?

654
00:32:32,257 --> 00:32:33,390
Where's Potolsky headed?

655
00:32:35,026 --> 00:32:37,027
What's altruism?!

656
00:32:39,063 --> 00:32:40,497
Charity.

657
00:32:42,467 --> 00:32:45,469
I know where he's going.

658
00:32:48,506 --> 00:32:51,208
- Name, please?
- He's, uh, Bruce Wayne.

659
00:32:51,242 --> 00:32:52,342
He's Bruce Wayne.

660
00:32:52,377 --> 00:32:54,645
- Just this way.
- Thank you. Thank you.

661
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:32,976
Enterprises is

662
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,611
a helping hand...

663
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:38,748
Oh, that's Miss Mathis.

664
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:40,717
She worked closely with your father.

665
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:43,753
Wayne Enterprises is a shelter for all.

666
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,789
And clean water...

667
00:34:03,874 --> 00:34:05,775
The smile of a child...

668
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,678
Please, sit, Bruce.

669
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,247
It is so good to see you out and about.

670
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:13,683
Glad to be here.

671
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:17,120
All of us at Wayne Enterprises
are so sorry for your loss.

672
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:21,024
So, are all you here on the board?

673
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:24,928
Oh, heavens no. We're middle management.

674
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:27,530
The board members don't
do this sort of thing.

675
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,165
No?

676
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,500
Why not?

677
00:34:30,534 --> 00:34:35,772
Well, they're very busy people, Bruce.

678
00:34:35,806 --> 00:34:37,674
Your family created a company

679
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,977
worth billions and billions of dollars.

680
00:34:41,011 --> 00:34:43,880
- How awesome is that?
- Awesome.

681
00:34:43,914 --> 00:34:46,116
I wanted to speak to
them because I've found

682
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,517
what looks like serious irregularities

683
00:34:47,551 --> 00:34:48,718
in the Arkham project.

684
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,187
Irregularities?

685
00:35:00,089 --> 00:35:04,034
I can assure you, Bruce,
that Wayne Enterprises

686
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:06,870
would never countenance
doing business with criminals.

687
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,671
- Just wouldn't happen.
- I hope so,

688
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:11,975
but I'd like to speak
directly with the board myself.

689
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:14,077
Can you make that happen?

690
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:17,080
I can certainly try.

691
00:35:19,683 --> 00:35:22,052
They prefer to communicate with minors

692
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:24,654
via the usual legal mediation, but...

693
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,022
Good evening, ladies and gentleman.

694
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,490
This is a public service announcement

695
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,993
on behalf of all living creatures.

696
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:32,929
You've heard of a drug called Viper?

697
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:37,233
That's me.

698
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,869
I made it for WellZyn,

699
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:43,106
a subsidiary of Wayne Enterprises.

700
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,575
- Is this true?
- Of course not, Bruce.

701
00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:47,944
I mean, this man is clearly insane.

702
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,822
The AC plant... where is it? On the roof?

703
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:00,690
Straight ahead, staircase
across the ballroom.

704
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:02,025
Clear the ballroom!

705
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:03,960
I hoped that a demonstration

706
00:36:03,994 --> 00:36:07,230
using street people would
suffice, but seems bad things

707
00:36:07,264 --> 00:36:12,302
only truly happen when they
happen to important people.

708
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,604
Like you!

709
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,611
GCPD! Everybody out!

710
00:36:21,645 --> 00:36:23,079
Now!

711
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:27,283
Turn it off!

712
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,320
Can't do that.

713
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,789
Turn it off or I'll shoot!

714
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,557
Go ahead.

715
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,059
My work is done.

716
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:52,642
Turn around! Put your
hands behind your head!

717
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:54,344
Interlock your fingers!

718
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,779
That's all right.

719
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:58,648
You're angry and confused.

720
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,150
I understand.

721
00:37:01,952 --> 00:37:03,787
There's no more need for violence.

722
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,323
Don't shoot!

723
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:08,258
That's considerate of you.

724
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:13,897
I'm leaving now.

725
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:16,433
Go look in warehouse 39.

726
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,767
You're not going anywhere!

727
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,370
I can go anywhere I want!

728
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:24,541
Don't do it!

729
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:35,552
You really can have too
much of a good thing.

730
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:17,707
Nothing.

731
00:38:17,742 --> 00:38:21,444
What'd you expect? It's Gotham.

732
00:38:31,246 --> 00:38:33,247
It's Mathis.

733
00:38:33,282 --> 00:38:35,983
I'm outside the site. They're here.

734
00:38:36,018 --> 00:38:38,219
No. I think we should leave them be.

735
00:38:38,253 --> 00:38:41,422
There's nothing here for them.

736
00:38:41,457 --> 00:38:44,459
We'll review that if they get close.

737
00:39:30,973 --> 00:39:32,373
It's been ten minutes.

738
00:39:32,408 --> 00:39:35,176
I-I assure you, my friend is reliable.

739
00:39:37,179 --> 00:39:38,679
You scared, Penguin?

740
00:39:39,915 --> 00:39:41,516
Your voice is doing that shaky thing.

741
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,484
No, sir.

742
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:45,353
I'm fine.

743
00:39:45,387 --> 00:39:46,988
You don't have to act tough.

744
00:39:47,022 --> 00:39:48,322
Nerves are a good thing.

745
00:39:48,357 --> 00:39:51,559
Perhaps I am a bit jittery, sir.

746
00:39:51,593 --> 00:39:53,161
Good.

747
00:39:53,195 --> 00:39:54,462
You should be.

748
00:39:55,764 --> 00:39:58,499
'Cause if my boys don't
make it, neither do you.

749
00:40:05,374 --> 00:40:06,941
Got 'em!

750
00:40:06,975 --> 00:40:07,975
Keep going!

751
00:40:09,111 --> 00:40:10,912
Ha!

752
00:40:10,946 --> 00:40:12,914
Take that, Falcone, you son of a bitch!

753
00:40:12,948 --> 00:40:16,184
Huh? I told you, Frankie,
the kid's a player.

754
00:40:16,218 --> 00:40:18,086
He's got a future.

755
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,189
What are you waiting
here like an old lady? Go!

756
00:40:30,065 --> 00:40:32,066
Untie me.

757
00:40:34,236 --> 00:40:36,237
Say "pretty please."

758
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,542
Please.

759
00:40:41,577 --> 00:40:43,678
Ah!

760
00:40:46,482 --> 00:40:51,319
Sometimes I think you really don't like me.

761
00:40:51,353 --> 00:40:53,721
Now, would I be backing your takeover

762
00:40:53,756 --> 00:40:55,723
if I didn't like you?

763
00:40:55,758 --> 00:40:58,226
And that stuff with Falcone...
well, we have to look good

764
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,394
for the old man.

765
00:40:59,428 --> 00:41:01,863
If he figures we're working together,

766
00:41:01,897 --> 00:41:05,299
we'd be cooked.

767
00:41:05,334 --> 00:41:08,569
- Patience.
- I have no more patience.

768
00:41:09,772 --> 00:41:11,773
The old man has to go.

769
00:41:11,807 --> 00:41:13,574
We must strike soon.

770
00:41:15,611 --> 00:41:19,380
Yes. Mm. But softly.

771
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,361
Excuse me.

772
00:42:07,863 --> 00:42:10,999
I couldn't help but overhear
that aria you were humming.

773
00:42:11,033 --> 00:42:13,201
Oh, yes. It's my favorite.

774
00:42:13,235 --> 00:42:14,502
Mine, too.

775
00:42:14,536 --> 00:42:18,139
Ah, well, there you go.

776
00:42:18,173 --> 00:42:20,575
I'm sorry, I-I just...

777
00:42:20,609 --> 00:42:23,578
I-I didn't mean to bother you.

778
00:42:23,612 --> 00:42:26,247
My mother sang that to me when I was young.

779
00:42:26,282 --> 00:42:28,216
Her whole life, she sang that to me.

780
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,718
I hadn't heard it in a while, and I...

781
00:42:30,753 --> 00:42:33,488
I had to smile because you look...

782
00:42:36,292 --> 00:42:39,227
Anyhow, sorry, I'm rambling on.

783
00:42:39,261 --> 00:42:41,796
No, that's okay.

784
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,331
Do you want to listen?

785
00:42:45,034 --> 00:42:46,434
Well, yeah.

786
00:42:46,468 --> 00:42:48,069
S-Sure, thank you.

787
00:42:48,103 --> 00:42:50,104
Let's sit down.

788
00:43:05,521 --> 00:43:07,422
Hmm.

789
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:19,788
