1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:02,969
<i>- Previously on</i> gotham...
- I've been sober for a year.

2
00:00:02,971 --> 00:00:05,171
That doesn't erase
the things that I did,

3
00:00:05,173 --> 00:00:06,773
But I still care about you.

4
00:00:06,775 --> 00:00:07,974
<i>"dear jim, I thought I could be</i>

5
00:00:07,976 --> 00:00:09,175

00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:10,810

00:00:10,812 --> 00:00:12,212
<i>"I'm going away for a while</i>

8
00:00:12,214 --> 00:00:13,546
<i>To get myself together."</i>

00:00:13,548 --> 00:00:15,448
<i>Trust me, and I'll trust you.</i>

10
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,549
In the meantime,

11
00:00:16,551 --> 00:00:19,953
Each of your tariffs
will increase 25%.

12
00:00:19,955 --> 00:00:21,454
Reach out to saviano
and turski.

13
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:23,356
They are worried about
ending up like bannion.

14
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:25,992
<i>The old man is herding
his sheep toward me.</i>

15
00:00:25,994 --> 00:00:27,394
Arrogant clown.

16
00:00:27,396 --> 00:00:28,728
Try to take
me down?

17
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,563
You do not know
where the edge is.

18
00:00:30,565 --> 00:00:31,731
<i>Arkham asylum?</i>

19
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:33,366
<i>Security guard for nut jobs?</i>

20
00:00:33,368 --> 00:00:34,634
It's that or quit.
So quit.

21
00:00:34,636 --> 00:00:36,069
That's what they want me to do.

22
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:37,737
<i>Falcone, the mayor...</i>

23
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,305
<i>I'm not gonna stop, harvey.</i>

24
00:00:39,307 --> 00:00:40,640
<i>I'm gonna get 'em.</i>

25

<i>If thou neglect'st
or dost unwillingly</i>

26
00:00:48,183 --> 00:00:50,417
What I command,

27
00:00:50,419 --> 00:00:53,553
I'll rack thee with old cramps.

28
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:56,189
Fill all thy bones

29
00:00:56,191 --> 00:00:58,224
With aches,

30
00:00:58,226 --> 00:00:59,592
Make thee roar

31
00:00:59,594 --> 00:01:02,495
That beasts shall

32
00:01:02,497 --> 00:01:04,931
Tremble at thy din.

33
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:05,933
Go, go.

34
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:06,934
No.

35
00:01:06,935 --> 00:01:08,501
Pray thee.

36
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:11,171
I must obey.

37
00:01:11,173 --> 00:01:15,108
His art is of such power...

38
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,111
Such power...

39
00:01:18,113 --> 00:01:21,514
"it will control my dam's god."

40
00:01:21,516 --> 00:01:23,616
It would control

41
00:01:23,618 --> 00:01:26,186
My dam's god setebos

42
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:29,422
And make a vassal of him.

43
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:32,692
So, slave, hence.

44
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,395

Get back.
Yah! Yah!

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,650
Ha!

58
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:32,152
Don't kill me!

59
00:02:37,626 --> 00:02:39,159
Stay down.

60
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:47,600
This is the fourth inmate
outburst in as many weeks

61
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:48,668
As you've been stationed here.

62
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,703
I understand
this is

63
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:52,672
Punishment duty for you,

64
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:55,141
But I expect professional
standards nonetheless.

65
00:02:55,143 --> 00:02:56,676
This is unacceptable,
gordon.

66
00:02:56,678 --> 00:02:58,545
Unacceptable.

67
00:02:58,547 --> 00:03:00,547
It's my fault,
mr. Lang.

68
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:02,215
The play was
too upsetting.

69
00:03:02,217 --> 00:03:04,617
We'll stick to comedies
from now on, I think.

70
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:05,785
Thank you,
nurse duncan.

71
00:03:05,787 --> 00:03:07,787
It's "director" or "dr. Lang,"

72
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:08,955
As you prefer.

73
00:03:08,957 --> 00:03:10,790
Recreational
activities

74
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:12,659
Are not pertinent
to this conversation.

75
00:03:12,661 --> 00:03:15,228
Officer gordon
is responsible

76
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,864
For security
on this wing,

77
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:20,800
A task which he seems
unable to manage.

78
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:24,470
What have you to say
about this, gordon?

79
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,540
This man needs
medical attention.

80
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,142
I'd see to him myself,

81
00:03:29,144 --> 00:03:30,710
But there's rules.

82
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:33,313
I dispense meds, not treatment.

83
00:03:33,315 --> 00:03:34,581
He needs a doctor.

84
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,583
Very well.

85
00:03:36,585 --> 00:03:39,719
I'll send one in.

86
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:43,489
Any more
incidents,

87
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:45,992
And I'll have you placed
on the remedial duty roster.

88
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:49,562
Think you can't fall
any farther?

89
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:51,631
Think again.

90
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,614
How is he?

91
00:04:10,352 --> 00:04:11,684
He's fine.

92
00:04:11,686 --> 00:04:13,453
Will be.

93
00:04:13,455 --> 00:04:15,088
And you?

94
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,090
I'm good.

95
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:17,824
Few bruises.

96
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,561
What?

97
00:04:21,563 --> 00:04:22,729
You're the famous

98
00:04:22,731 --> 00:04:24,731
Detective jim gordon,
aren't you?

99
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:25,932
That's my name.

100
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:27,300
I'm not sure about "famous."

101
00:04:27,302 --> 00:04:28,901
Notorious, then?

102
00:04:28,903 --> 00:04:30,370
Nearer the mark.

103
00:04:30,372 --> 00:04:31,571
Who are you?

104
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:33,706
Leslie thompkins.

105
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:34,974
Dr. Thompkins.

106
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,611
You work here?

107
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:40,747
I'm not an inmate.

108
00:04:40,749 --> 00:04:43,116
I haven't seen you
on infirmary duty before.

109
00:04:43,118 --> 00:04:44,584
I work in the female ward.

110
00:04:44,586 --> 00:04:46,653
I come over here
when they're short-handed.

111
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,856
All the girls
are talking about you.

112
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,825
Brave detective brought low

113
00:04:52,827 --> 00:04:54,127
By fighting city hall.

114
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:55,795
Ah.

115
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:57,430
They say that, do they?

116
00:04:57,432 --> 00:05:00,433
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to make light of your situation.

117
00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:03,269
It's okay.

118
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:05,505
Personally, I think
what you're doing is admirable.

119
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,274
I'm guarding lunatics.

120
00:05:08,276 --> 00:05:09,842
No. You're not quitting.

121
00:05:09,844 --> 00:05:11,744
Not yet.

122
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,348
Who are you?

123
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,683
Oh, sorry.

124
00:05:16,685 --> 00:05:18,084
I didn't mean to blurt
all that out like I did.

125
00:05:18,086 --> 00:05:19,485
It's none of my business.

126
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,687
Uh,
dr. Thompkins,

127
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:23,356
You sure this inmate's
gonna be okay?

128
00:05:23,358 --> 00:05:24,791
He's fine.

129
00:05:24,793 --> 00:05:26,326
He's just sleeping off his meds.

130
00:05:26,328 --> 00:05:27,760
I'm trying.

131
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,897
Get a room, you guys.

132
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:33,833
I should go.

133
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:34,834
It's nice to meet you, jim.

134
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:36,769
Likewise.

135
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:07,934
Ivy?

136
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,038
How you doing?

137
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,973
I... I'm good.

138
00:06:13,975 --> 00:06:15,408
I'm good.

139
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,709
You look sick.

140
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:18,177
Like you need a doctor.

141
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:19,512
No doctors.

142
00:06:19,514 --> 00:06:21,381
N... Never, ever again.

143
00:06:21,383 --> 00:06:23,916
I-I'm fine.

144
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:25,985
I-I was resting.

145
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,563
I got a place we can go, ivy.

146
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:38,898
Come on.

147
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,967
I-I-I, I'm
shivery is all.

148
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:45,773
Okay.

149
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:49,809
Come on.

150
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:28,347
They're gone.

151
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:30,783
It's safe.

152
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:32,885
Sure?

153
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:35,288
Sure as sure.

154
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,924
We'll only stay until
you feel better.

155
00:07:37,926 --> 00:07:40,793
Come and lay down
on the couch there.

156
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:43,930
Wh... What if the real
people come home?

157
00:07:43,932 --> 00:07:45,832
There's dust on
everything

158
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:47,800
And something
smells rotten.

159
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:50,136
Nobody's
coming.

160
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:51,471
Whose place is
this, anyways?

161
00:07:51,473 --> 00:07:52,972
How come you ask so
many questions, ivy?

162
00:07:52,974 --> 00:07:54,640
I'm trying
to help you.

163
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:56,576
Now lie down
and I'll get
you a blanket.

164
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,992
Morning, gentlemen.

165
00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:15,928
Have you considered
my proposition?

166
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:16,996
Uh, yeah.

167
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:17,998
No.

168
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:19,332
No?

169
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:20,334
We already pay enough.

170
00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:21,868
Don maroni set the rates
last year.

171
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,936
And now I'm raising
the prices.

172
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:25,838
Inflation is a bitch.

173
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,340
Maroni said...

174
00:08:27,342 --> 00:08:28,875
Maroni, maroni....

175
00:08:28,877 --> 00:08:30,643
You're beginning to irk me.

176
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:33,446
You're talking to me,
the penguin.

177
00:08:33,448 --> 00:08:34,514
So you're penguin.

178
00:08:34,516 --> 00:08:35,882
So what?

179
00:08:35,884 --> 00:08:37,183
I called the cops on you.

180
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:40,453
It's<i> the</i> penguin.

181
00:08:40,455 --> 00:08:42,154
And that was a very
naive call to make.

182
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:45,625
Hello, we own the cops
on the waterfront.

183
00:08:45,627 --> 00:08:46,993
Tell that to the cops, buddy.

184
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,031
Boys.

185
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:53,199
Why the frowns?

186
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:14,053
Jones?

187
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:18,291
Jones.

188
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,470
Hey, frogman.

189
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,143
Hey.

190
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:41,681
Hey.

191
00:09:58,029 --> 00:09:59,129
These are electrode wounds.

192
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,931
This man was
given a crude,

193
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,033
Invasive kind of
electroshock therapy.

194
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,102
Metal needles were
inserted into the brain

195
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,637
And electricity was applied
to his frontal lobes.

196
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,105
What for?

197
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,107
Surgically, it's used
to modify aberrant behavior,

198
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,976
But in this case, way
too much voltage was used

199
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,877
And his brain is
completely fried.

200
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,380
Another under your watch,
gordon?

201
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,781
How did this happen?

202
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,117
You rushed
into opening,

203
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,719
And now you're
running this place

204
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,754
With skeleton staff
and zero surveillance

205
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,390
In an unsafe and unsecure
200-year-old maze.

206
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,325
Excellent. Excuses.

207
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,327
That's that nature
of municipal operations.

208
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:33,063
You inherit problems

209
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,132
And you use the resources
at hand to do with you can.

210
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,134
Well, our resources don't
stretch nearly far enough

211
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,637
To cover a criminal
assault investigation.

212
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,005
We should call the gcpd.

213
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:44,208
No, this is
an in-house medical issue.

214
00:10:46,144 --> 00:10:48,012
He still breathing?

215
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,247
Well, yes, but he's
effectively brain dead.

216
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,348
What does...

217
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,683
He's still breathing.

218
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,284
Unaided.

219
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,953
For all official purposes, well,

220
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,455
He's still alive.

221
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,124
Keep him comfortable, doctor.

222
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:03,293
Officer gordon?

223
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,029
I want you
to find out which one

224
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,264
Of our charming inmates
did this.

225
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:11,268
I want a report
on my desk Friday.

226
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:22,012
Another day, another dollar.

227
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,014
Really? This is rather usual

228
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,616
And sinister, isn't it?

229
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,352
Yes.

230
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,621
So, who are we looking for?

231
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,890
What does it take
to pull this off?

232
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,191
Uh...

233
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,226
Some basic knowledge
of human anatomy.

234
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,128
Um, basic electrical skills.

235
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,697
A circuit board,

236
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,731
Some wiring.

237
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:41,899
Is that all?

238
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,667
And the door keys, of course.

239
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,069
"the door keys."

240
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,471
Right.

241
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:50,040
No, man, I got
my keys right here.

242
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,542
Look at me, steven.

243
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,077
Look at me.

244
00:11:55,013 --> 00:11:56,547
Tell me the truth.

245
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,182
Why you picking on me?

246
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,050
There's five other guards
with keys to this wing.

247
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,819
True, and you're
the only one who looks

248
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,353
And smells like a hunted animal.

249
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,889
Look, steven.

250
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,858
Whoever fried frogman had keys.

251
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,493
Now, we've searched
all the inmates' cells.

252
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,161
No keys.

253
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,396
But I know they're out there.

254
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,098
And I need to know where.

255
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,166
I'm backed up
against the wall here.

256
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,736
And I'm starting to lose my
patience... do you understand?

257
00:12:19,838 --> 00:12:23,373
That fight... During the play.

258
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,509
Right after, I noticed
my keys were gone.

259
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:28,112
You lose equipment,
that's a big deal.

260
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,581
They dock me a week's pay,
so I tracked done a spare set!

261
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,749
Who took the keys?

262
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,883
I don't know.

263
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,151
Anyone could've taken them.

264
00:12:36,855 --> 00:12:38,288
Walk away.

265
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,389
Sorry...

266
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,959
Walk away!

267
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,398
<i>And then he raises our taxes</i>

268
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,434
After his money blows up.

269
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,969
Killed bannion like
he was nobody.

270
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,403
I'll say it.

271
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,639
I wish something would happen
to old man falcone

272
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,941
Before he comes after one of us.

273
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,276
That's where this is going.

274
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,245
Slow down. Now, let's imagine

275
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,313
God forbid anything
happened to falcone.

276
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:04,915
Just for kicks...

277
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,750
Who would take over then?

278
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:07,951
Who would take over?

279
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,052
I do.

280
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,754
You?

281
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:13,624
Now, that never occurred to me.

282
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,292
What never occurred?

283
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,227
I'm next in line. Seniority.

284
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,429
That's the way the system works.

285
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:22,166
That's how the system used
to work back in the day.

286
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,967
It's a new dawn,
a new city.

287
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,402
I would believe we would need

288
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,504
Some fresh thinking at the top.

289
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,506
And who is the fresh thinker
that you got in mind?

290
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:30,974
Let me guess.

291
00:13:31,943 --> 00:13:32,976
Who?

292
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,244
Her.

293
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:35,345
She's talking about her.

294
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,980
Oh.

295
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,515
Really?

296
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:41,118
You don't think
I could run the family?

297
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,186
Hey, no, why not?

298
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,921
Woman's lib and all that.

299
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,924
But fair play,
jimmy is next in line.

300
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:49,693
Well, there's no need to argue.

301
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,095
It's all hypotheticals anyhow.

302
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:55,232
We're just talking, right?

303
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,840
Inmate 5075 jack gruber.

304
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,876
Inmate gruber?

305
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,612
Did you take
officer wenger's keys?

306
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,815
You're looking into
the sad demise of the frogman.

307
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,184
The frogman disrupted
your play last night.

308
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,686
Yeah.

309
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,654
You didn't like him
very much, did you?

310
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,356
Well, I had no
opinion of him.

311
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,358
He was called the frogman
because he believed

312
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,794
A giant bullfrog lived
inside his abdomen,

313
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,429
Controlling his thoughts.

314
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:28,465
He was already dead.

315
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,467
I don't waste psychic energy
on the dead.

316
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:35,239
Rape, murder...

317
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,841
You're no stranger
to violence, gruber.

318
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:41,311
Your psych evals say
you're a grade-a sociopath.

319
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,847
Why should I take your word
for anything?

320
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,416
You shouldn't believe
everything you read, jim.

321
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,652
May I call you jim?

322
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,320
Did you take the keys?
Please,

323
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,322
Search my cell if you do
not find me trustworthy,

324
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:57,794
But, no, jim, I did not
take anyone's keys.

325
00:15:01,032 --> 00:15:02,532
Thank you.

326
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,167
Guard?

327
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:07,404
Did you take
officer wenger's keys?

328
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,207
No.

329
00:15:13,711 --> 00:15:14,811
Hey. Hey!

330
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,283
Settle down.

331
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,352
S-settle down.
- Settle down.

332
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,354
Did you take off...

333
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,427
You have the keys?

334
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:40,070
Get the straps!
Need a restraint!

335
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,205
Keys?
Yes.

336
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,875
Keys. Did you take
the guard's keys?

337
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,644
No. Am I in trouble?

338
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,246
No, aaron,

339
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,448
Unless you're lying to me.

340
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,382
Lying?

341
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,784
Aaron never lies,

342
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,218
Mr. Gordon.

343
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,720
He doesn't have the concept,

344
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,189
Poor peaceful soul that he is.

345
00:16:00,158 --> 00:16:03,126
He killed his family
with an axe.

346
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,429
Isn't that
what you did, aaron?

347
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:09,366
Never harmed a fly before
or since.

348
00:16:10,335 --> 00:16:13,303
I said sorry.

349
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,138
Okay, aaron.

350
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,506
You're free to go.

351
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:19,176
Thank you. Guard?

352
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:36,593
You saw how that went.

353
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,428
Saviano's the problem.

354
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,164
Now, on his own, janacek,
I can turn him around.

355
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,166
And the junior capos
will follow him.

356
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,003
But that saviano,
we got to deal with him

357
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,804
Before we make our move
on maroni.

358
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,606
Why not let me talk
to saviano

359
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:52,542
On my own?
Me and jimmy go way back.

360
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:55,278
That's true. You do go way back.

361
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:57,881
What would you tell him?

362
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,616
I'd say you're
the best candidate.

363
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,018
He knows that.

364
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,953
He just can't admit it
to your face.

365
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,621
Too proud.

366
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:07,024
Okay then.

367
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,892
Talk to him.

368
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,327
Will do.

369
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,795
Butch,

370
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,398
You're not turning on me,
are you?

371
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,665
Ho!

372
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,235
What kind of question is that?

373
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,537
Why would you even joke
about something like that?

374
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,539
I'm just asking.

375
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,842
A girl gets insecure
once in a while.

376
00:18:18,129 --> 00:18:20,597
Royston, what are you doing
out of your cell?

377
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,566
Hey, cut it out!

378
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,968
Full fathom five
thy father lies.

379
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,971
Of his bones are coral made.

380
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,640
Aw, hell.

381
00:18:42,452 --> 00:18:44,753
Royston,
is that your name?

382
00:18:44,755 --> 00:18:47,556
Sea nymphs hourly ring
his knell.

383
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:49,258
Fascinating.

384
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,594
The poor man can walk and talk,
but all he remembers are lines

385
00:18:51,596 --> 00:18:52,728
From the play.

386
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,130
Same electroshock technique

387
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:57,133
As frogman but with slightly
less drastic results.

388
00:18:57,135 --> 00:18:59,635
It's like whoever's doing this
is improving their methods.

389
00:18:59,637 --> 00:19:01,637
Or maybe their process
is so haphazard, they don't know

390
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:03,973
What kind of outcome
they're gonna get.

391
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:06,175
One man ends up
a vegetable,

392
00:19:06,177 --> 00:19:09,178
While the other one
recites shakespeare on a loop.

393
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,914
I don't understand
what an inmate gains

394
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,316
From scrambling up
another inmate.

395
00:19:17,487 --> 00:19:19,488
You should stay
on the female wing for a while.

396
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,490
There's no reason
to put yourself in danger.

397
00:19:21,492 --> 00:19:23,492
I'm perfectly capable
of protecting myself.

398
00:19:23,494 --> 00:19:25,294
Besides, my patients need me.

399
00:19:25,296 --> 00:19:26,662
There's gonna be some drama
around here.

400
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:27,963
The missing keys

401
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:29,298
Made me focus on the inmates,

402
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,666
But I think it's a misdirection.

403
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:33,702
I think I should be focusing
on the staff.

404
00:19:33,704 --> 00:19:36,939
Oh. I see.

405
00:19:36,941 --> 00:19:39,775
There will be some drama.

406
00:19:39,777 --> 00:19:41,510
But, wait, I'm staff.

407
00:19:41,512 --> 00:19:43,012
What if it's me?

408
00:19:43,014 --> 00:19:44,680
It's not you.
How can you tell?

409
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:46,615
You're not the type.
Cop skills, huh?

410
00:19:46,617 --> 00:19:49,318
You can read people.

411
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,754
Some people.

412
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:57,193
A staff member?
That's absurd.

413
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:59,528
It was an inmate.
I don't think so.

414
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,530
Your job is to oversee
inmate security.

415
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:03,732
You're not authorized to
conduct an investigation

416
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:05,000
Of the staff.

417
00:20:05,002 --> 00:20:08,737
Whoa. You're trying
to force my hand.

418
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:10,339
You want me to
call the police.

419
00:20:10,341 --> 00:20:12,341
No.

420
00:20:12,343 --> 00:20:15,277
I already called 'em.

421
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,462
Barbara, you need to wake up.

422
00:20:34,665 --> 00:20:36,666
Morning.

423
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,102
I got you coffee.

424
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:42,505
Mmm, extra sweet.

425
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,608
You always remember.

426
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,109
Yeah.

427
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,445
Have you spoken to jim recently?

428
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,380
Why would I?

429
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:51,781
Renee, you don't

430
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,783
Have to be jealous of jim.

431
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,986
I'm over him.

432
00:20:56,954 --> 00:20:59,522
This was a mistake.

433
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,458
What was?

434
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,560
This. Us.

435
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,195
I should have never let it
go on for this long.

436
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,697
I'm s... I'm sorry.

437
00:21:10,368 --> 00:21:12,369
Oh, I-I see.

438
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,570
Look, barbara...

439
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:16,139
No. No. I mean, you're...

440
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:19,242
No, you are absolutely right.
This-this was a mistake.

441
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,611
This has been a really
long process for me,

442
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,281
And I've worked too hard
to get right with myself.

443
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:28,318
I-I wanted this to be good,
but I can't fall back now.

444
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,420
The drinking,
the drugs.

445
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,289
We're toxic together,
you and me.

446
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,757
Please, renee, stop.

447
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,125
There's no need
to say another word.

448
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,127
I am sorry that I interfered
with your process.

449
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,428
Barbara,
you need help

450
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,130
I can't give you right now.
Let me call jim

451
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,765
For you, please.
No.

452
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:44,668
Where's my purse?
You don't need
to go. Stay here.

453
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,736
Take time to get yourself
together. I'll go.

454
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:49,839
I am perfectly together,
thank you.

455
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:51,841
I am just toxic, that's all.

456
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:53,143
Now, where's my damn purse?!

457
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,411
Barbara, stop.

458
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,879
Calm down, please, all right?

459
00:21:57,481 --> 00:21:58,682
I'll go.

460
00:21:58,684 --> 00:21:59,816
Please.

461
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,819
Fine.

462
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,421
Do what you want. Go.

463
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,023
I'm sorry...

464
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:08,992
Just go.

465
00:22:30,314 --> 00:22:32,315
Hey, pal.

466
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,684
In a cow slip's
bell I lie,

467
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:38,121
There I crouch
when owls do cry.

468
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:39,322
All right.

469
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:40,523
I can dig that.

470
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,694
Detective...

471
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,528
Jim!

472
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,530
Partner. Mwah!

473
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,199
Let me take
a good look at you.

474
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,401
Lord have
mercy, a screw.

475
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:52,702
Excuse me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

476
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,737
Hey, you weren't exaggerating.

477
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:56,740
Freaky as advertised.

478
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,541
Nobody of authority
called on you, sir.

479
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,909
This is not a police matter.

480
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,711
You must be
director dr. Lang.

481
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,313
See, I beg to differ.

482
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:08,017
This is third degree assault,
at the very least.

483
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:11,221
A friend of yours,
is it?

484
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,022
Egregious insubordination.

485
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,358
Your job here was already
hanging on a thread.

486
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,560
This is the end of your career
in law enforcement.

487
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,928
Count on it.
Whoa!

488
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,663
Take it easy,
hot shot.

489
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:21,831
Officer gordon did
the right thing.

490
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:22,932
Why wouldn't he
call the police?

491
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,000
Anyone would
think you'd want

492
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:26,336
To keep
this business quiet.

493
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:27,937
Gerry... It is
gerry, isn't it?

494
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:30,840
Now, did you do
this terrible thing, gerry?

495
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:33,977
That doesn't even
merit a reply.

496
00:23:35,045 --> 00:23:37,547
No, I did not do
this terrible thing.

497
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,182
But you have the skill,
though, as a doctor.

498
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,583
I mean, you could do
it, lickety-split.

499
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,951
Now, why would I do this?

500
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:42,786
Why would anyone?

501
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,687
Exactly,
officer gordon.

502
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,122
Gerry, I think we're
gonna have to take you

503
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:47,891
Down to the precinct... you're
raising a lot of questions

504
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:50,927
That need clearing up in
a more formal setting.

505
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,695
Well, you can't
do this...
Sh-sh-sh-shush.

506
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:56,566
As of this moment, this is an
official gcpd investigation.

507
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:58,968
You, sir, will cooperate
or face arrest.

508
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,639
Would you mind going through
the, uh, staff records

509
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,774
While I take gerry, here,
downtown for a chat?

510
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:05,842
Will do, detective.

511
00:24:08,877 --> 00:24:10,545
Sir?

512
00:24:11,548 --> 00:24:12,948
Jimmy.

513
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:13,950
Butch.

514
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,553
Good to see you.

515
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:19,555
Come on.

516
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,960
Like old times, huh?

517
00:24:24,962 --> 00:24:26,562
All we need is
a bottle of applejack.

518
00:24:27,731 --> 00:24:30,732
What happened, man?

519
00:24:30,734 --> 00:24:31,900
In my head, it's...

520
00:24:31,902 --> 00:24:34,937
We're still kids, chasing
girls in harlow park.

521
00:24:34,939 --> 00:24:35,939
Yeah.

522
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,506
We caught a couple
of hot ones, huh?

523
00:24:37,508 --> 00:24:38,740
Especially me.

524
00:24:42,078 --> 00:24:45,180
Thanks for
meeting with me.

525
00:24:45,182 --> 00:24:47,516
What did you tell
your boss-lady?

526
00:24:47,518 --> 00:24:50,752
I suggested I reach out
to you. She agreed.

527
00:24:50,754 --> 00:24:53,956
Talk some
sense into me?

528
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:56,258
It's a new dawn.

529
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,693
Yeah, like that.

530
00:24:57,695 --> 00:25:00,028
She's not wrong, you know?

531
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,464
City's changing.

532
00:25:02,466 --> 00:25:05,100
You really want falcone's job?

533
00:25:06,836 --> 00:25:08,871
Since we were kids, I
love you like a brother.

534
00:25:08,873 --> 00:25:10,539
I love you, too.

535
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:11,940
Always. You know that.

536
00:25:11,942 --> 00:25:14,009
I do, I do.

537
00:25:14,011 --> 00:25:15,444
That's why
I trust you.

538
00:25:15,446 --> 00:25:17,346
And that's why I say
to you with love...

539
00:25:17,348 --> 00:25:19,214
Fish is doomed.

540
00:25:19,216 --> 00:25:22,050
There's no way she gets the
chair. It ain't gonna happen.

541
00:25:22,052 --> 00:25:23,552
She's a smart
cookie, but she's

542
00:25:23,554 --> 00:25:25,954
Overreaching. I mean,
come on, butch, without

543
00:25:25,956 --> 00:25:28,023
You and your crew,
what's she got?

544
00:25:28,025 --> 00:25:29,358
Very little.

545
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,561
Everybody knows it. You know it.

546
00:25:32,563 --> 00:25:35,697
Maybe.

547
00:25:36,966 --> 00:25:39,301
What's it gonna take
to make you make a move?

548
00:25:39,303 --> 00:25:40,736
What are you offering?

549
00:25:40,738 --> 00:25:42,004
Name it.

550
00:25:42,006 --> 00:25:44,239
Drop fish, come over to us.

551
00:25:44,241 --> 00:25:48,076
The club... all the businesses
attached... they're yours.

552
00:25:48,078 --> 00:25:50,979
That's day one.
A welcome bonus.

553
00:25:50,981 --> 00:25:53,882
What else you want?

554
00:25:55,652 --> 00:25:58,654
That's a good question.

555
00:25:58,656 --> 00:26:00,055
Let me think it over.

556
00:26:00,057 --> 00:26:02,057
Yeah.

557
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,827
Hey, brother.

558
00:26:07,664 --> 00:26:09,998
Don't think too long, huh?

559
00:26:21,044 --> 00:26:22,844
Detective bullock.

560
00:26:22,846 --> 00:26:25,213
Wait here.

561
00:26:25,215 --> 00:26:27,683
Penguin.

562
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:29,017
It's good to see you.

563
00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:30,085
What are you guys doing?

564
00:26:30,087 --> 00:26:32,120
Old friend.

565
00:26:32,122 --> 00:26:33,889
Thank goodness you're here.

566
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:35,257
There's been some silly mistake.

567
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:36,592
Looks like it.

568
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,360
Unless you irritated
someone important...

569
00:26:38,362 --> 00:26:39,795
You didn't do that, did you?

570
00:26:39,797 --> 00:26:40,929
Me?

571
00:26:40,931 --> 00:26:42,264
Of course not.

572
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:43,932
You sure?

573
00:26:43,934 --> 00:26:46,234
Examine your soul, penguin.

574
00:26:46,236 --> 00:26:47,536
Wait!

575
00:26:47,538 --> 00:26:51,206
Don't go. Please, sir,
I-I beg of you.

576
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:54,443
My patron, don maroni,
is obviously

577
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:56,144
Unaware of my predicament.

578
00:26:57,146 --> 00:26:59,147
A simple phone call would

579
00:26:59,149 --> 00:27:01,550
Resolve things, I'm sure.

580
00:27:01,552 --> 00:27:04,486
But, see, I like
having you here.

581
00:27:04,488 --> 00:27:07,389
'cause I can sit at my desk

582
00:27:07,391 --> 00:27:09,157
And look at you.

583
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:10,592
It's soothing.

584
00:27:10,594 --> 00:27:12,527
Like a bonsai tree.

585
00:27:18,635 --> 00:27:20,702
What's a
bonsai tree?

586
00:27:24,974 --> 00:27:27,409
♪ ♪

587
00:27:33,983 --> 00:27:35,183
So...

588
00:27:35,185 --> 00:27:37,786
Did you see our friend?

589
00:27:37,788 --> 00:27:39,021
I saw him.

590
00:27:39,023 --> 00:27:40,622
And?

591
00:27:40,624 --> 00:27:42,090
Eh.

592
00:27:42,092 --> 00:27:43,925
I'm working him.

593
00:27:43,927 --> 00:27:45,394
He's a stubborn cuss, that one.

594
00:27:46,996 --> 00:27:49,264
Just give him a little time.

595
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:52,768
Time, hmm?

596
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,369
Okay.

597
00:27:54,371 --> 00:27:55,771
He can have time.

598
00:27:56,773 --> 00:27:58,040
Yeah.

599
00:27:58,042 --> 00:28:00,776
I'm optimistic.

600
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:01,943
Good.

601
00:28:10,117 --> 00:28:11,351
<i>All right, doctor,</i>

602
00:28:11,353 --> 00:28:12,852
Pretend I'm an ignoramus.

603
00:28:12,854 --> 00:28:14,854
Shouldn't be too hard, hmm?

604
00:28:14,856 --> 00:28:17,057
Explain to me this whole crazy
electric needle business.

605
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:19,359
When a real doctor
like you does it,

606
00:28:19,361 --> 00:28:21,194
What's it supposed to do?

607
00:28:21,196 --> 00:28:23,863
Electroshock therapy
is a common procedure

608
00:28:23,865 --> 00:28:26,132
For mood and behavior
alteration.

609
00:28:26,134 --> 00:28:28,134
Like mind control?
Of a sort.

610
00:28:28,136 --> 00:28:30,136
Blue sky experimentation
on humans

611
00:28:30,138 --> 00:28:32,005
Is considered unethical,

612
00:28:32,007 --> 00:28:34,174
So we know very little
of the hard science.

613
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,508
Okay.
But skilled

614
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:38,912
Surgeons can elicit
very specific responses.

615
00:28:38,914 --> 00:28:40,580
Uh-huh.
But those inmates

616
00:28:40,582 --> 00:28:42,549
Weren't treated
by a skilled surgeon.

617
00:28:42,551 --> 00:28:44,350
You sure about that?
There are no

618
00:28:44,352 --> 00:28:46,219
Skilled surgeons
amongst the inmates.

619
00:28:46,221 --> 00:28:47,554
Or the staff.

620
00:28:47,556 --> 00:28:49,055
You're a skilled surgeon.

621
00:28:49,057 --> 00:28:51,825
What...
we've been over this.

622
00:28:51,827 --> 00:28:53,993
I haven't opened a body
since med school.

623
00:28:53,995 --> 00:28:56,162
I'm just messing with you.

624
00:28:56,164 --> 00:28:58,598
I don't think
you're the man behind this.

625
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,767
No, you're not the
type to break rules.

626
00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:02,769
Too scared of authority.

627
00:29:02,771 --> 00:29:04,671
But you're hiding something.
What is it?

628
00:29:04,673 --> 00:29:06,239
Well, everybody's
hiding something.

629
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:08,041
Don't play tag.

630
00:29:08,043 --> 00:29:10,376
You're right, detective.

631
00:29:10,378 --> 00:29:12,545
I am afraid of authority.

632
00:29:12,547 --> 00:29:13,947
And the things I'm hiding?

633
00:29:13,949 --> 00:29:15,081
I'll never tell you.

634
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:16,883
Sounds heavy.
Heavy?

635
00:29:16,885 --> 00:29:18,718
Yes. And if you know
what's good for you,

636
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,053
You won't dig any deeper.

637
00:29:20,055 --> 00:29:21,187
All right.

638
00:29:21,189 --> 00:29:23,590
I don't want to hit
any power lines.

639
00:29:23,592 --> 00:29:25,592
Don't have to
tell me twice.

640
00:29:25,594 --> 00:29:26,860
No digging. Unless, of course,

641
00:29:26,862 --> 00:29:29,129
It has something
to do with the case at hand.

642
00:29:29,131 --> 00:29:30,263
Nothing.

643
00:30:02,297 --> 00:30:06,133
Oh. Great, thank you.

644
00:30:08,236 --> 00:30:10,938
Oh, you poor thing.
You look so pale.

645
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,306
Any joy?

646
00:30:12,308 --> 00:30:14,842
Not so far.

647
00:30:14,844 --> 00:30:16,510
The files seem to be incomplete.

648
00:30:17,846 --> 00:30:19,646
I'm wondering if there's
more in the basement.

649
00:30:20,682 --> 00:30:23,150
Blueprint says there's
a records office down there.

650
00:30:23,152 --> 00:30:26,120
Oh, the basement's closed off.

651
00:30:26,122 --> 00:30:28,289
Unsafe chemicals.

652
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:29,924
Nobody's been down
there for ten years.

653
00:30:33,261 --> 00:30:35,329
Do you know the way down there?

654
00:30:40,201 --> 00:30:42,936
All right,
suppose you had to pick out

655
00:30:42,938 --> 00:30:45,171
One member of your staff
as the culprit.

656
00:30:45,173 --> 00:30:46,606
Who would it be?

657
00:30:46,608 --> 00:30:47,974
It wasn't a staff member.

658
00:30:47,976 --> 00:30:50,610
Whatever. Just the first face
that pops to your mind.

659
00:30:50,612 --> 00:30:51,845
Nobody.

660
00:30:51,847 --> 00:30:53,780
They're good people.
I know them well.

661
00:30:53,782 --> 00:30:56,216
They've all been with me
for more than five years.

662
00:30:56,218 --> 00:30:58,151
We all came to arkham together.

663
00:30:58,153 --> 00:31:00,220
Th...
Wait.

664
00:31:00,222 --> 00:31:02,889
Hold that. You just
saw someone. Who was it?

665
00:31:02,891 --> 00:31:04,724
Oh.
No, she couldn't..

666
00:31:04,726 --> 00:31:06,059
She?

667
00:31:06,061 --> 00:31:08,127
Who?

668
00:31:17,639 --> 00:31:19,839
What's that?

669
00:31:19,841 --> 00:31:22,475
Everybody's
in their cell.

670
00:31:23,477 --> 00:31:24,944
Dorothy.

671
00:31:26,046 --> 00:31:28,581
Jim, hi. What's up?

672
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:30,450
Hi, leslie.

673
00:31:32,553 --> 00:31:34,387
We're going
on an adventure

674
00:31:34,389 --> 00:31:36,656
To the basement.

675
00:31:36,658 --> 00:31:38,324
Oh. Well, that
sounds fun.

676
00:31:39,426 --> 00:31:40,960
Can I come?
No.

677
00:31:43,197 --> 00:31:45,932
But...
Dr. Thompkins,
what did I tell you earlier?

678
00:31:45,934 --> 00:31:47,400
You should go home.

679
00:31:47,402 --> 00:31:48,768
Why? What's wrong?

680
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,169
Nothing's wrong.

681
00:31:51,205 --> 00:31:53,039
Go home.

682
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:54,440
I don't understa...

683
00:31:54,442 --> 00:31:56,009
Oh.
Whoa!

684
00:31:56,011 --> 00:31:57,377
You okay?

685
00:31:57,379 --> 00:32:00,380
I need you to find
the main entry guard,

686
00:32:00,382 --> 00:32:01,447
Tell him to
hit lockdown,

687
00:32:01,449 --> 00:32:03,416
Then get out of the
building, quick.
Okay,

688
00:32:03,418 --> 00:32:04,951
Hit lockdown.
Get out. Will do.

689
00:32:07,422 --> 00:32:08,755
- Yeah.
- Jim, listen,

690
00:32:08,757 --> 00:32:10,523
Dorothy duncan isn't staff.
She's an inmate.

691
00:32:10,525 --> 00:32:11,958
I know. Get over here now.

692
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:45,959
Leslie!

693
00:33:22,863 --> 00:33:24,664
Guard!

694
00:33:24,666 --> 00:33:26,499
Guard! Help!

695
00:33:27,434 --> 00:33:28,968
Dr. Thompkins.

696
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,503
Jim, behind you.

697
00:33:34,141 --> 00:33:35,975
Men!

698
00:33:35,977 --> 00:33:37,944
Men! What the hell

699
00:33:37,946 --> 00:33:39,779
Do you think you're playing at?!

700
00:33:39,781 --> 00:33:41,714
Go back in your cells

701
00:33:41,716 --> 00:33:43,282
Right now!

702
00:33:43,284 --> 00:33:44,650
You hear me?

703
00:33:44,652 --> 00:33:46,352
That's an order!

704
00:34:07,807 --> 00:34:11,709
Remember, I'm a vegan...
no butter.

705
00:34:11,711 --> 00:34:14,579
Yeah, yeah.

706
00:34:18,717 --> 00:34:20,018
Hi.

707
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,520
Hi. I-is this...

708
00:34:22,522 --> 00:34:24,756
Is jim gordon there?

709
00:34:25,724 --> 00:34:27,191
Yes, he is.

710
00:34:27,193 --> 00:34:30,528
But I'm sorry,
jim is kind of busy right now.

711
00:34:32,165 --> 00:34:34,399
Can I take a message?

712
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:36,734
No.

713
00:34:36,736 --> 00:34:39,337
No, that's okay.

714
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:41,005
I...

715
00:34:41,007 --> 00:34:42,707
Who is this?

716
00:34:42,709 --> 00:34:44,876
I'm a friend of jim's.

717
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:46,110
Who's that?

718
00:34:46,112 --> 00:34:48,680
Go to hell!

719
00:34:52,452 --> 00:34:54,719
M.E.'s got her
in the morgue.

720
00:34:54,721 --> 00:34:57,221
When dorothy duncan was a
16-year-old nursing student,

721
00:34:57,223 --> 00:34:59,624
She killed five kids
with poison candy...

722
00:34:59,626 --> 00:35:01,125
For homework, she said.

723
00:35:01,127 --> 00:35:03,561
She's spent over half
her life at arkham.

724
00:35:03,563 --> 00:35:05,096
When the asylum closed,
there was chaos.

725
00:35:05,098 --> 00:35:06,931
She must have just
hunkered down in the basement

726
00:35:06,933 --> 00:35:09,434
Until it reopened.
Forensics is sweeping
the basement level

727
00:35:09,436 --> 00:35:10,735
Looking for her lair.

728
00:35:10,737 --> 00:35:11,970
Poor soul.

729
00:35:11,972 --> 00:35:14,038
- What was she trying to do?
- Who knows?

730
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,441
Maybe she was just
trying to find a cure
for her own madness.

731
00:35:16,443 --> 00:35:18,276
She was crazy.
Enough said.

732
00:35:18,278 --> 00:35:20,144
It's good
to see you, jim.

733
00:35:20,146 --> 00:35:22,080
And you got a win, huh?

734
00:35:22,082 --> 00:35:24,716
Still fightin'.
Nice work.

735
00:35:24,718 --> 00:35:26,784
Yeah, I don't think my boss
is gonna see it that way.

736
00:35:26,786 --> 00:35:29,087
He's working for the king
of all cheese grinders.

737
00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:32,056
It's a crying shame, cap...
we need to get him
back on the job.

738
00:35:32,058 --> 00:35:36,594
You know I'd bring you back here
in a second... If I could.

739
00:35:36,596 --> 00:35:37,829
I know.

740
00:35:37,831 --> 00:35:40,064
It's all good, captain.

741
00:35:40,066 --> 00:35:42,166
You do look spiffy
in the uniform.

742
00:35:42,168 --> 00:35:44,435
Yeah, if spiffy
means dorky.

743
00:35:44,437 --> 00:35:46,204
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

744
00:35:47,139 --> 00:35:49,807
How about a drink
for old times' sake?

745
00:35:49,809 --> 00:35:51,509
Sounds good.

746
00:35:53,346 --> 00:35:54,980
Penguin.

747
00:35:56,017 --> 00:35:58,584
Hi. Sir.

748
00:35:58,586 --> 00:36:01,020
Uh, don maroni.

749
00:36:01,022 --> 00:36:02,788
Thank heavens you're here.

750
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,857
You look kind of frowsty.

751
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:07,126
Uh... Forgive me.

752
00:36:07,128 --> 00:36:09,161
I've had nothing but
a moist towelette

753
00:36:09,163 --> 00:36:10,829
Since yesterday morning.

754
00:36:10,831 --> 00:36:13,198
A very sad picture.

755
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,167
You know why you're in there?

756
00:36:15,169 --> 00:36:18,604
I have no idea.
A rhetorical
question.

757
00:36:18,606 --> 00:36:21,373
You're in there
because I put you in there.

758
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:24,543
But, don maroni, wh-why?

759
00:36:24,545 --> 00:36:26,612
What did I do?

760
00:36:26,614 --> 00:36:28,947
Do you know what hubris is?

761
00:36:31,117 --> 00:36:31,817
Do you know?!

762
00:36:31,819 --> 00:36:33,318
Sorry.

763
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,155
I-I thought that was another...

764
00:36:36,157 --> 00:36:37,389
Rhetorical...

765
00:36:37,391 --> 00:36:38,857
Question.

766
00:36:38,859 --> 00:36:41,193
Yes, I do.
H-hubris. It's when...

767
00:36:41,195 --> 00:36:42,728
It's when
limping little

768
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:45,898
Chickenbutt second bananas
think they're hot stuff.

769
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,167
Sir...
When dumbass underlings

770
00:36:48,169 --> 00:36:50,969
Raise taxes
without asking me first.

771
00:36:50,971 --> 00:36:53,138
Yes, sir.
On<i> fishermen.</i>

772
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,974
You raised taxes on fishermen.

773
00:36:55,976 --> 00:36:58,310
They're out there
in the freakin' ocean

774
00:36:58,312 --> 00:37:00,345
Risking their lives
for us,

775
00:37:00,347 --> 00:37:03,649
And you raise their taxes
without asking me?

776
00:37:05,151 --> 00:37:08,053
That's hubris, my friend.

777
00:37:08,055 --> 00:37:10,089
I'm sorry, don maroni.

778
00:37:10,091 --> 00:37:13,092
Deeply... Sorry.

779
00:37:13,094 --> 00:37:15,961
I will never do it again.

780
00:37:19,099 --> 00:37:21,233
All right, then.

781
00:37:23,169 --> 00:37:25,237
Hey, you.

782
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:27,239
Let my friends out.

783
00:37:27,241 --> 00:37:29,007
Excuse me?
What, am I

784
00:37:29,009 --> 00:37:31,276
Talking hungarian?
Open the cage, mook.

785
00:37:42,523 --> 00:37:45,190
Come here.

786
00:37:45,192 --> 00:37:47,526
Holy mother, you stink!

787
00:37:49,129 --> 00:37:51,563
Let this be a lesson
to you, yes?

788
00:37:51,565 --> 00:37:53,232
Yes, sir.

789
00:37:53,234 --> 00:37:55,701
You're
a smart monkey...

790
00:37:55,703 --> 00:37:58,036
But you're a monkey.

791
00:37:58,038 --> 00:38:00,139
And I'm the zookeeper.

792
00:38:03,743 --> 00:38:05,778
Yeah, you're all right.

793
00:38:12,718 --> 00:38:15,520
Captain, you should see this.

794
00:38:15,522 --> 00:38:16,721
Look here.

795
00:38:16,723 --> 00:38:19,691
Dorothy duncan.
Electrode wounds,

796
00:38:19,693 --> 00:38:20,759
Both sides.

797
00:38:20,761 --> 00:38:22,260
Same gauge as the
other victims.

798
00:38:22,262 --> 00:38:25,397
About a month old.
They were hidden
by her hair.

799
00:38:25,399 --> 00:38:27,265
This is crazy...
how could she have done this

800
00:38:27,267 --> 00:38:28,500
To herself?
She couldn't.

801
00:38:28,502 --> 00:38:29,868
Not humanly possible.

802
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,770
Which means she
was just another victim.

803
00:38:31,772 --> 00:38:32,772
She couldn't.

804
00:38:32,773 --> 00:38:34,339
Aw, crap.

805
00:38:37,877 --> 00:38:39,778
Hey, aaron.

806
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,646
What's up?

807
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:45,717
Hey.

808
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:46,851
Where'd you get those...

809
00:38:46,853 --> 00:38:48,319
Hey!

810
00:38:56,762 --> 00:38:59,964
Well done, aaron.

811
00:39:01,233 --> 00:39:03,735
Exactly like I told you.

812
00:39:03,737 --> 00:39:08,473
Oh, now you are my
best work so far.

813
00:39:08,475 --> 00:39:10,442
Mm.

814
00:39:19,052 --> 00:39:21,853
Hello, dr. Lang.

815
00:39:28,292 --> 00:39:29,559
Lang?

816
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,795
Lang!
They're gone.

817
00:39:32,797 --> 00:39:34,197
Get an ambulance.

818
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:36,466
- Go!
- Not...

819
00:39:36,468 --> 00:39:38,167
Staff.
Don't speak.

820
00:39:38,169 --> 00:39:39,736
Just breathe.

821
00:39:39,738 --> 00:39:42,138
Breathe!
Gr... Gruber.

You remember
when we were 14,

We stole all that meat
from satriani's?

853
00:41:54,773 --> 00:41:56,239
Yeah, I do.
It was, like,

50 pounds of pork and whatnot.

Thing is, when
I was sharing it out,

858
00:42:04,749 --> 00:42:07,684
There was, like, 15 pounds of
prime angus beefsteaks in there.

00:42:07,686 --> 00:42:10,320
And I kept it all
for myself.

Yeah, it's been bugging me
ever since.
