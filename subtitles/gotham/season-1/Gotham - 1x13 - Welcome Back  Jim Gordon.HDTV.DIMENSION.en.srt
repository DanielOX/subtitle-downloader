1
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:03,034
<i>Previously on Gotham...</i>

2
00:00:03,068 --> 00:00:04,802
I'm sorry you had to
get mixed up in this.

3
00:00:04,837 --> 00:00:08,473
'Cause I'm sure you're a
good, honest girl, really.

4
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,711
- I'm gonna disappear.
- You can't do that.

5
00:00:13,746 --> 00:00:15,380
- I wasn't asking.
- You can't disappear.

6
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:16,648
You have to come back home with me.

7
00:00:16,682 --> 00:00:18,483
When Detective Gordon finds the man

8
00:00:18,517 --> 00:00:20,785
who killed my parents,
you have to testify.

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,420
I want these two alive for now.

10
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:24,389
You dare use my sainted
mother against me?

11
00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:26,424
You'll suffer for that.

12
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:27,892
Say your good-byes quickly.

13
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:29,294
Miss Mooney has places to go.

14
00:00:29,328 --> 00:00:31,329
Hello, Fish.

15
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:10,168
Well, you must be the B team.

16
00:01:10,202 --> 00:01:11,803
We just handle transpo.

17
00:01:11,837 --> 00:01:14,205
Bob will be taking care of you.

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,440
Bob?

19
00:01:15,474 --> 00:01:16,708
One of our top guys.

20
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:18,743
You're in good hands.

21
00:01:23,315 --> 00:01:24,816
Good morning.

22
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,453
You're up early.

23
00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:30,455
I haven't made it to bed yet.

24
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:32,557
Word is you got caught
with Doc Thompkins

25
00:01:32,591 --> 00:01:34,058
in the locker room.

26
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,793
Strictly business.

27
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:37,896
- Any word on Fish?
- No.

28
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,165
Club's all shot up, blood
everywhere, no sign of Fish.

29
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:41,633
It's her own damn fault.

30
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:44,169
She played the game,
she knew the risks.

31
00:01:44,203 --> 00:01:46,304
Sorry, Harv, I know you
have a thing for her.

32
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:47,505
I don't got a thing for nobody.

33
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,073
My thing is for me.

34
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:51,176
If anyone can make it
out of a scrape like that,

35
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,877
it's Fish...
The woman's nails.

36
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:54,412
Come on, we got a case.

37
00:01:54,446 --> 00:01:56,648
Yeah. What do we got?

38
00:01:56,682 --> 00:01:58,149
Public service homicide.

39
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:00,218
Vic's a douche.

40
00:02:00,252 --> 00:02:01,586
Flass. Gordon.

41
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,887
Gordon. Flass.

42
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,723
Flass works Narcotics.

43
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:08,593
Hence the bling and the,
no doubt expensive

44
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:10,195
yet somehow cheap-looking

45
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,563
Italian suit.

46
00:02:11,597 --> 00:02:13,364
Bullock, still
dressing in the dark

47
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,900
and smelling like a taphouse whore.

48
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:17,368
One of Flass's connections

49
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,437
tipped him off on the body.

50
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,372
Why don't you tell
Gordon about the kid.

51
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,208
Pinky Littlefield.

52
00:02:23,242 --> 00:02:26,010
Dealer from a crew known
as the Uptown Assassins.

53
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:28,079
He works this block. Well...

54
00:02:28,113 --> 00:02:29,247
least he did.

55
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:30,348
Any drugs on him?

56
00:02:30,382 --> 00:02:31,449
Didn't find any.

57
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,885
My big wild guess: Deal gone bad.

58
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,154
Kid like this, bound to
happen sooner or later.

59
00:02:36,188 --> 00:02:37,155
Like I said,

60
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:38,556
public service homicide.

61
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,925
Well, boys, I've got another
case I've got to attend to,

62
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,127
so if you don't need
any more hand-holding.

63
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:45,096
I'm gonna walk you out.

64
00:03:27,306 --> 00:03:29,607
Unis think
they may have found a witness.

65
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,509
Night janitor.

66
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,545
They're bringing him over.

67
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:41,019
Jim, Mr. Winkler.

68
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:42,320
Sir.

69
00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:44,022
No need for the formalities.

70
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:45,490
Call me Leon.

71
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:46,958
Leon.

72
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:49,127
We really appreciate
you stepping forward.

73
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:51,663
My wife Louisa always says,
if you don't step forward,

74
00:03:51,697 --> 00:03:52,964
you step back.

75
00:03:52,998 --> 00:03:54,799
She sounds like a smart lady.

76
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,501
Yes, she is.

77
00:03:56,535 --> 00:03:58,670
So, do I

78
00:03:58,704 --> 00:03:59,938
give a statement?

79
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:01,639
A description of the killer?

80
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,374
I'm not sure how this works.

81
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,076
Would you be willing to
come down to the precinct,

82
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,078
work with a sketch artist?

83
00:04:07,112 --> 00:04:09,781
That really is the best
way to catch the killer.

84
00:04:09,815 --> 00:04:12,183
It'd be a huge help.

85
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,085
Of course.

86
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,954
Thank you, sir.

87
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:22,327
Yes, sweetheart, I'm
still at the precinct.

88
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,563
I know.

89
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,032
Of course, yeah.

90
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,468
Well... okay.

91
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,203
They send in the sketch artist yet?

92
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,471
No, not yet.

93
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:35,240
Louisa, I have to go.

94
00:04:35,274 --> 00:04:37,041
Bye-bye.

95
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:40,078
But you did see the killer, right?

96
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:43,982
Yes, that's what I
told the detectives earlier.

97
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:45,950
I'm sorry, who are you?

98
00:04:51,957 --> 00:04:53,858
How the hell did this happen?

99
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,360
Security cameras inside
and outside the room

100
00:04:55,394 --> 00:04:56,528
were turned off.

101
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:57,829
Ed, you got any
thoughts on the weapon?

102
00:04:57,863 --> 00:04:59,431
What's strong enough to smash ships

103
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,932
but still fears the sun?

104
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:02,367
Can it with the riddles, Ed.

105
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:04,903
I don't have the patience
today or any day.

106
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,738
- Ice.
- Correct.

107
00:05:06,772 --> 00:05:08,339
Gauging by the small
circumference of the wounds,

108
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,108
I believe the weapon is an ice pick.

109
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:12,677
Carbon steel, six inches long.

110
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:14,979
Driven in deep enough that it
marked the surrounding tissue

111
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,849
with an imprint of a
distinctive hexagonal handle.

112
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:19,284
It's not your standard kitchen fare.

113
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:20,852
Fun fact, gentlemen:

114
00:05:20,886 --> 00:05:22,687
Mr. Winkler's wounds here

115
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:25,223
are the exact same as the wounds
on the victim from this morning.

116
00:05:25,257 --> 00:05:26,791
The drug dealer? Littlefield?

117
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,159
Him. Same weapon.

118
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:29,994
Same killer, one would suppose.

119
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:35,300
Damn it.

120
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:38,169
Right in our house.

121
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:41,206
Okay.

122
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,441
What is your name?

123
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,443
You know who I am.

124
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:48,313
It's just a formality.

125
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,747
I...

126
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,816
like to be sure.

127
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,253
Bob?

128
00:05:55,287 --> 00:05:57,555
Is that short for Robert?

129
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,557
You have any family, Robert?

130
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,893
Two lovely daughters.

131
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:05,296
I'm putting you down as Maria
Mercedes Mooney, aka Fish.

132
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:08,767
We'll be extracting a very
sincere apology from you today.

133
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,502
Shouldn't take too long.

134
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,104
How old are your girls, Robert?

135
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:17,442
I bet you they're some
ugly little creatures.

136
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:26,618
Now, come on, Fish.

137
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,920
No call for rudeness.

138
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,996
Only my friends call
me Fish, darling.

139
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,098
And you and I,

140
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:42,801
we're not friends..

141
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,269
Yet.

00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:12,167
You go get him.

145
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:14,636
I got to find the keys
to the incinerator.

146
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:33,422
Marco.

147
00:07:39,128 --> 00:07:43,498
Where's... Fish... Mooney?

148
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:46,034
How is anyone gonna trust
us to keep them safe?

149
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:48,637
We can't protect people
in our own house.

150
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:50,339
Upside is the place is
crawling with criminals,

151
00:07:50,373 --> 00:07:52,541
so we got beaucoup
suspects to choose from.

152
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,842
That's an upside?

153
00:07:53,877 --> 00:07:56,111
Security cameras were turned off.

154
00:07:56,145 --> 00:07:57,412
Could've been a cop.

155
00:07:57,447 --> 00:07:59,114
Probably was.

156
00:07:59,148 --> 00:08:01,016
You do not even think
something like that.

157
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,451
The second that those guys

158
00:08:02,485 --> 00:08:04,553
out there hear that
you're looking at a cop,

159
00:08:04,587 --> 00:08:06,788
they are gonna turn on you.

160
00:08:06,823 --> 00:08:08,757
Bullock's right;
You start pointing fingers,

161
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,352
you could jeopardize
your reinstatement.

162
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,294
You need concrete
evidence to even think

163
00:08:12,328 --> 00:08:14,663
of accusing another
officer of murder.

164
00:08:14,697 --> 00:08:16,398
I'll start with the
guard duty logbook.

165
00:08:16,432 --> 00:08:18,100
Jim... Winkler was my witness.

166
00:08:18,134 --> 00:08:19,801
No way I'm letting this ride.

167
00:08:19,836 --> 00:08:22,604
I asked him to come in here;
I'm gonna find his killer.

168
00:08:24,007 --> 00:08:26,675
No matter who it is.

169
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:28,844
Proceed with caution.

170
00:08:28,878 --> 00:08:30,646
Yes, ma'am.

171
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,814
No big moves without my say-so.

172
00:08:43,126 --> 00:08:45,460
I do believe

173
00:08:45,495 --> 00:08:48,130
this is the second time
we've been around this block,

174
00:08:48,164 --> 00:08:49,798
Master Bruce.

175
00:08:49,832 --> 00:08:51,200
Selina likes to hang out here.

176
00:08:51,234 --> 00:08:52,601
It's worth doubling back.

177
00:08:52,635 --> 00:08:54,803
Besides, you got what you wanted.

178
00:08:54,837 --> 00:08:56,705
I went out of town like you asked.

179
00:08:56,739 --> 00:08:58,140
For weeks.

180
00:08:58,174 --> 00:09:00,709
Yeah, well...

181
00:09:00,743 --> 00:09:04,279
it wasn't safe here, was it?

182
00:09:04,314 --> 00:09:06,481
The assassins weren't after me.

183
00:09:06,516 --> 00:09:08,784
<i>They were after her.</i>

184
00:09:08,818 --> 00:09:11,286
<i>Yeah, and we'll be back
on that plane straight back to</i>

185
00:09:11,321 --> 00:09:12,888
the bloody Alps the
first sign of trouble,

186
00:09:12,922 --> 00:09:14,857
I tell you.

187
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:16,291
Master Bruce.

188
00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:19,194
Master Bruce, get
back in the car now.

189
00:09:19,229 --> 00:09:20,662
Can we walk around
the block just once?

190
00:09:20,697 --> 00:09:21,997
Then I'll get back in the car.

191
00:09:22,031 --> 00:09:24,199
Please, Alfred.

192
00:09:24,234 --> 00:09:25,901
Once around the block and then home.

193
00:09:25,935 --> 00:09:28,003
Thank you.

194
00:09:28,037 --> 00:09:29,905
Got the rest of your life
like that to get whipped

195
00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:31,006
into a frenzy by the females.

196
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,574
I don't know why you
want to start now.

197
00:09:32,609 --> 00:09:33,642
It's not like that.

198
00:09:33,676 --> 00:09:35,043
Out of my way.

199
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:37,613
Ivy?

200
00:09:39,215 --> 00:09:40,415
Steady, Master Bruce.

201
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,750
Looks like she's got the mange.

202
00:09:41,784 --> 00:09:43,352
Look who it is.

203
00:09:43,386 --> 00:09:45,420
Billionaire Bruce Wayne.

204
00:09:45,455 --> 00:09:47,422
Who are you, his bodyguard?

205
00:09:47,457 --> 00:09:48,824
If needs be, miss, yes.

206
00:09:48,858 --> 00:09:50,058
What's in the bag?

207
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:52,728
It's for Selina.

208
00:09:52,762 --> 00:09:54,129
Have you seen her?

209
00:09:54,164 --> 00:09:56,365
Sure. I can give it
to her if you want.

210
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,434
Perhaps you could pass
on a message for me.

211
00:10:01,371 --> 00:10:02,531
Tell her I'm looking for her.

212
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:03,739
20 bucks.

213
00:10:03,773 --> 00:10:05,774
Alfred.

214
00:10:10,813 --> 00:10:12,381
20 bucks.

215
00:10:12,415 --> 00:10:14,550
There we are, miss.

216
00:10:17,987 --> 00:10:20,389
Delightful friends you
have, Master Bruce.

217
00:10:21,624 --> 00:10:23,725
Home.

218
00:10:36,105 --> 00:10:38,073
That's all you got?

219
00:10:38,107 --> 00:10:41,610
You are gonna bore
me to death, fella.

220
00:10:41,644 --> 00:10:43,946
That's impressive.

221
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,214
Different strokes?

222
00:10:45,248 --> 00:10:47,216
You know, me,

223
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,750
I can't stand hot spicy food,

224
00:10:48,785 --> 00:10:50,919
but my wife, you know, she loves it.

225
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:53,355
Hotter the better.

226
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:56,091
Now where, where
are we gonna begin?

227
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:04,666
Now, taking off a hand,
that's devastating.

228
00:11:07,337 --> 00:11:09,304
But I've found

229
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:12,441
that taking out a knee...

230
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,860
You okay, Fish?

231
00:11:40,703 --> 00:11:43,172
A page is missing from this logbook.

232
00:11:43,206 --> 00:11:44,840
Now, that in and of itself

233
00:11:44,874 --> 00:11:46,975
is grounds for dismissal

234
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,477
from the force.

235
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:49,845
So my question to you is

236
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,446
who was on guard duty

237
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:53,315
outside of interrogation
this morning?

238
00:11:55,985 --> 00:11:57,686
No idea, man.

239
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,055
<i>Nobody's talking.</i>

240
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:01,990
They're protecting their own.

241
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:03,458
Or they just don't like you.

242
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:05,093
Face it, Harvey.

243
00:12:05,128 --> 00:12:07,896
Leon Winkler's killer is a cop.

244
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:09,832
Not proven.

245
00:12:09,866 --> 00:12:11,300
Come on, you know these guys.

246
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:12,701
You've known them since way back.

247
00:12:12,735 --> 00:12:14,837
Give me some leverage.
Give me an angle.

248
00:12:16,573 --> 00:12:18,640
You really want to
work with a murderer?

249
00:12:22,378 --> 00:12:25,481
Somebody gets whacked in the GCPD.

250
00:12:25,515 --> 00:12:26,915
Somebody's gonna get fired for this.

251
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,050
Not me, pal.

252
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:29,818
Grover.

253
00:12:31,821 --> 00:12:33,822
We got a reliable guy

254
00:12:33,857 --> 00:12:35,624
says it was you pulled the page

255
00:12:35,658 --> 00:12:36,992
from the guard duty logbook.

256
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:39,328
No way.
Where did you get that?

257
00:12:39,362 --> 00:12:41,497
- Who said that?
- Alvarez.

258
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:44,333
If he said that, that
son of a bitch is lying.

259
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:45,701
Why would he lie?

260
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:47,002
Look, six years ago,

261
00:12:47,036 --> 00:12:48,737
I had a thing with his wife, okay?

262
00:12:48,771 --> 00:12:50,672
Six years ago.

263
00:12:50,707 --> 00:12:52,140
He is a vindictive bastard.

264
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:54,576
Well, look, that's none
of our business?

265
00:12:56,112 --> 00:12:58,213
Look at it from our point of view.

266
00:12:58,248 --> 00:13:01,183
We got to find the culprit.

267
00:13:01,217 --> 00:13:02,651
Brass demands one.

268
00:13:02,685 --> 00:13:04,253
But it wasn't me.

269
00:13:04,287 --> 00:13:06,221
Then who was it?

270
00:13:12,362 --> 00:13:14,563
Delaware? Anybody seen Delaware?

271
00:13:14,597 --> 00:13:17,266
Saw him go to the garage.

272
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:21,837
Delaware.

273
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:35,684
You're gonna regret that.

274
00:13:35,718 --> 00:13:37,052
You were guarding interrogation
this morning, weren't you?

275
00:13:37,086 --> 00:13:38,387
Screw off.

276
00:14:36,813 --> 00:14:38,147
Jim.

277
00:14:38,181 --> 00:14:39,615
What the hell are you doing?

278
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:41,283
You couldn't bring
him in here quietly,

279
00:14:41,317 --> 00:14:43,318
put him in some back room?

280
00:14:43,353 --> 00:14:44,953
You making some kind of statement?

281
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:48,390
Damn right I am.

282
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,322
I warned you and you didn't listen.

283
00:15:02,356 --> 00:15:04,357
I have evidence: The same drugs

284
00:15:04,391 --> 00:15:05,558
I found in Littlefield's shoe

285
00:15:05,593 --> 00:15:07,861
at the crime scene
yesterday morning.

286
00:15:07,895 --> 00:15:09,629
That evidence is part of an ongoing

287
00:15:09,663 --> 00:15:11,531
undercover narco investigation.

288
00:15:11,565 --> 00:15:13,032
You expect us to believe that?

289
00:15:13,067 --> 00:15:16,002
Jim, narco's been knee-deep
in the Uptown drug trade

290
00:15:16,036 --> 00:15:17,770
for months.

291
00:15:17,805 --> 00:15:19,706
I've got a matrix of undercovers
that have put their lives

292
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,040
at stake for this investigation.

293
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:23,510
Your little stunt
gets out, you unravel

294
00:15:23,544 --> 00:15:24,544
the whole operation.

295
00:15:24,578 --> 00:15:26,713
Not to mention, the
search was illegal.

296
00:15:26,747 --> 00:15:28,982
So we're ignoring Delaware's
involvement in Winkler's death?

297
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:30,550
Is that what we're doing, Cap?

298
00:15:30,584 --> 00:15:33,319
No. But this isn't the way, Jim.

299
00:15:33,354 --> 00:15:35,288
I'm turning over the
case to Internal Affairs.

300
00:15:35,322 --> 00:15:37,157
I.A.?

301
00:15:37,191 --> 00:15:38,791
Two old drunks in the basement.

302
00:15:38,826 --> 00:15:39,959
You and Bullock

303
00:15:39,994 --> 00:15:42,896
are no longer investigating
the Winkler murder.

304
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,291
What about the Littlefield murder?

305
00:15:44,298 --> 00:15:46,833
Or, wait, is that also
a part of an ongoing

306
00:15:46,867 --> 00:15:48,568
narco investigation?

307
00:15:48,602 --> 00:15:51,337
All you, buddy. Let me
know if you need any help.

308
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:55,575
I'm sorry about the confusion.

309
00:16:08,522 --> 00:16:10,523
Can I help you with something?

310
00:16:10,558 --> 00:16:13,226
Did you know, Miss Kringle,
that the earliest greeting cards

311
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,894
dated back to Germany in the 1400s?

312
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:17,597
I have a lot of work to do.

313
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:18,898
This is for you.

314
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:22,035
Doesn't say anything weird, does it?

315
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:23,102
No, ma'am.

316
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,069
Take it easy.

317
00:16:56,103 --> 00:16:58,271
I'm fine, Butch.

318
00:16:58,305 --> 00:17:00,440
Here, try this.

319
00:17:05,346 --> 00:17:06,579
You okay?

320
00:17:06,614 --> 00:17:08,114
I'm starving.

321
00:17:12,186 --> 00:17:14,521
You are one tough cookie.

322
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:21,961
Thank you, Butch.

323
00:17:25,466 --> 00:17:27,433
Listen, we should hit the road.

324
00:17:27,468 --> 00:17:28,935
I figure we've got about
an hour before Falcone...

325
00:17:28,969 --> 00:17:32,639
I'm not going anywhere
until I find Penguin.

326
00:17:32,673 --> 00:17:34,674
He's the one that told
Falcone about Liza.

327
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,776
Boss, I
don't know if you remember,

328
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:38,978
but as of last night,
we don't have any men.

329
00:17:39,013 --> 00:17:41,281
Falcone's gonna have the
whole city looking for us.

330
00:17:41,315 --> 00:17:47,387
I'm not going anywhere
until I cut Penguin's throat.

331
00:17:49,156 --> 00:17:54,194
One... two... three.

332
00:17:58,332 --> 00:18:01,301
What do you think, Mother?

333
00:18:01,335 --> 00:18:05,004
It's beautiful.

334
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,540
So classy.

335
00:18:09,543 --> 00:18:11,478
Like an opera house.

336
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,925
A chandelier.

337
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,160
Like home.

338
00:18:30,731 --> 00:18:35,068
Someone left a scarf.

339
00:18:37,304 --> 00:18:39,405
It's beautiful with my dress.

340
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,442
Finders keepers.

341
00:18:42,476 --> 00:18:47,180
And now you are in
charge of this club?

342
00:18:49,116 --> 00:18:51,551
Spoiled my surprise.

343
00:18:51,585 --> 00:18:53,586
<i>No. No, no, liebchen.</i>

344
00:18:53,621 --> 00:18:55,688
No, don't be angry. No.

345
00:18:55,723 --> 00:18:58,024
Such good news.

346
00:18:58,058 --> 00:19:00,426
My boy has a club.

347
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:02,595
<i>Will have a club.</i>

348
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,898
There's still a few
loose ends to tie up,

349
00:19:04,932 --> 00:19:08,134
but... soon it will be mine.

350
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:12,705
I am so proud of you...

351
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,442
I could spit.

352
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:21,147
<i>Listen, Jim, there's
something I got to tell you.</i>

353
00:19:21,182 --> 00:19:23,583
A few years ago,
Flass and his people

354
00:19:23,617 --> 00:19:27,887
started busting drug dealers,
taking over their stash houses,

355
00:19:27,922 --> 00:19:31,090
running them themselves.

356
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,959
Now?

357
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:34,961
You tell me this now?

358
00:19:34,995 --> 00:19:36,629
Look, I respond to
crises as they arise.

359
00:19:36,664 --> 00:19:38,731
I'm not a forward planner like
you. I didn't tell you then

360
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:40,767
because I didn't want to
get you all riled you up,

361
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:44,003
but I'm telling you now
because I want you to stop.

362
00:19:46,307 --> 00:19:49,642
Flass is protected.

363
00:19:49,677 --> 00:19:52,178
By who?

364
00:19:52,213 --> 00:19:54,013
Serious people.

365
00:19:54,048 --> 00:19:56,583
Really high up. Big money.

366
00:19:56,617 --> 00:19:58,685
For all I know, the
commissioner gets a piece, too.

367
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:01,321
You mess with Flass, you can
forget going back to Arkham.

368
00:20:01,355 --> 00:20:02,322
These guys

369
00:20:02,356 --> 00:20:03,623
do not play.

370
00:20:06,327 --> 00:20:08,294
These stash houses-

371
00:20:08,329 --> 00:20:10,296
think you can get me
a location on them?

372
00:20:10,331 --> 00:20:12,098
Did you not hear a word I just said?

373
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:14,300
The stash houses could give
us evidence linking Flass

374
00:20:14,335 --> 00:20:15,702
to Littlefield's murder.

375
00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:17,977
We nail him for Littlefield,
we can nail him for Winkler.

376
00:20:18,005 --> 00:20:19,806
I can't let it be, Harvey.

377
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:23,309
You should know that by now.

378
00:20:34,855 --> 00:20:36,823
Mick, it's Harv.

379
00:20:36,857 --> 00:20:39,025
You know that thing you
and Donnie were working on?

380
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:40,226
The Flass thing?

381
00:20:40,261 --> 00:20:43,063
I need your help.

382
00:20:55,843 --> 00:20:57,811
Prime spot for a stash house.

383
00:20:57,845 --> 00:20:59,846
Yeah.

384
00:21:14,395 --> 00:21:15,895
Delaware,

385
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,198
hand over the boxes.

386
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:22,168
You don't learn, do you?

387
00:21:22,203 --> 00:21:23,269
Get out of my face.

388
00:21:33,247 --> 00:21:34,781
No need to

389
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:36,282
rough each other up, gentlemen.

390
00:21:36,317 --> 00:21:37,917
I got a warrant.

391
00:21:37,952 --> 00:21:40,754
Giving us the legal right
to search and seizure.

392
00:21:40,788 --> 00:21:43,390
Seems this warehouse was
being used as a home base

393
00:21:43,424 --> 00:21:44,924
by the Uptown Assassins.

394
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:46,860
You expect us to believe you got

395
00:21:46,894 --> 00:21:49,029
a signed warrant to clear
your own stash house?

396
00:21:49,063 --> 00:21:51,631
On the commissioner's request.

397
00:21:51,665 --> 00:21:55,468
Signed by Judge Bam-Bam.

398
00:21:56,671 --> 00:22:00,507
Guess you don't have
a leg to stand on...

399
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,409
homicide.

400
00:22:16,696 --> 00:22:18,897
- So what's our next step?
- Next step?

401
00:22:18,931 --> 00:22:21,967
We got nothing to tie Flass
to the drugs or the murders.

402
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:23,969
Murder.

403
00:22:24,003 --> 00:22:25,637
Just one.

404
00:22:25,671 --> 00:22:29,441
Internal Affairs just ruled
Winkler's death as a suicide.

405
00:22:29,475 --> 00:22:31,143
They're releasing the body

406
00:22:31,177 --> 00:22:32,444
to his wife.

407
00:22:33,813 --> 00:22:36,281
Leon was so very happy.

408
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:40,152
This just can't
be right. Can't be...

409
00:22:44,123 --> 00:22:45,557
A suicide?

410
00:22:45,591 --> 00:22:47,726
He stabbed himself in
the back with an ice pick?

411
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,127
That's absurd!

412
00:22:49,162 --> 00:22:51,763
A ruling this quick means
the commissioner was involved.

413
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:53,098
Screw the commissioner.

414
00:22:53,132 --> 00:22:56,201
Going forward with this
puts all of our jobs at risk.

415
00:22:56,235 --> 00:22:58,036
Look,

416
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,371
I want to help you, Jim.

417
00:22:59,405 --> 00:23:01,940
There are people here in
GCPD who want to help you.

418
00:23:01,974 --> 00:23:03,842
- So why don't they?
- They have.

419
00:23:03,876 --> 00:23:05,811
I have.

420
00:23:05,845 --> 00:23:07,946
And we learned the hard way.

421
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,882
With men like Flass,
you need more than words.

422
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:12,117
You need results.

423
00:23:12,151 --> 00:23:13,785
And that's not gonna
happen this time around.

424
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,687
So do us all a favor and move on

425
00:23:15,721 --> 00:23:17,489
to the next vic.

426
00:23:17,523 --> 00:23:19,491
Please.

427
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:42,047
Where you going?

428
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:44,082
Back in an hour.

429
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:48,920
Listen to this. This is classic.

430
00:23:48,955 --> 00:23:50,088
Stop it. Come on.

431
00:23:50,123 --> 00:23:51,890
Come on.

432
00:23:51,924 --> 00:23:53,892
"Dear Miss Kringle,

433
00:23:53,926 --> 00:23:57,863
"your eyes are as green as a meadow.

434
00:23:57,897 --> 00:24:00,432
"Your smile is as bright as the sun.

435
00:24:00,466 --> 00:24:03,535
"Your skin is as white
as a snowflake.

436
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:06,104
It seems like your life is fun."

437
00:24:08,775 --> 00:24:11,042
Really?

438
00:24:11,077 --> 00:24:12,310
It's the writer himself.

439
00:24:14,714 --> 00:24:17,616
It's a real piece of
work you got there, perv.

440
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,451
I wouldn't quit your
day job if I were you.

441
00:24:19,485 --> 00:24:21,353
Roger, dodger.

442
00:24:21,387 --> 00:24:23,889
- Roger, dodger?
- Stop it.

443
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:26,958
What a creep.

444
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,569
One, two, three. One, two, three.

445
00:24:37,603 --> 00:24:39,604
One, two, three. One...

446
00:24:39,639 --> 00:24:43,108
Now... now you are getting it.

447
00:24:43,142 --> 00:24:48,814
You are so graceful
for such a big man.

448
00:24:48,848 --> 00:24:50,849
Isn't he graceful, Oswald?

449
00:24:50,883 --> 00:24:53,785
Yes, Mother.

450
00:24:56,489 --> 00:24:58,657
Jim.

451
00:24:58,691 --> 00:24:59,858
Welcome.

452
00:25:01,327 --> 00:25:02,494
Come in.

453
00:25:06,365 --> 00:25:09,768
Another handsome man at the party.

454
00:25:09,802 --> 00:25:11,870
I am so lucky.

455
00:25:11,904 --> 00:25:13,872
This is Jim Gordon,

456
00:25:13,906 --> 00:25:15,440
the detective friend

457
00:25:15,475 --> 00:25:16,942
I was telling you about.

458
00:25:16,976 --> 00:25:19,911
So nice to meet

459
00:25:19,946 --> 00:25:21,780
a friend of Oswald's.

460
00:25:21,814 --> 00:25:24,616
I am Gertrud Kapelput.

461
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,719
Nice to meet you,
too, Mrs. Kapelput.

462
00:25:29,122 --> 00:25:31,022
Mother,

463
00:25:31,057 --> 00:25:32,557
Jim and I have very important

464
00:25:32,592 --> 00:25:34,126
- business.
- No.

465
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,061
Sad. How sad.

466
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,830
A little soon

467
00:25:38,865 --> 00:25:40,499
to be celebrating, don't you think?

468
00:25:40,533 --> 00:25:42,601
Well, don't just stand there.

469
00:25:42,635 --> 00:25:43,535
Sit.

470
00:25:43,569 --> 00:25:45,137
This won't take long.

471
00:25:45,171 --> 00:25:47,172
I insist. Sit.

472
00:25:51,511 --> 00:25:54,079
I'm so very glad you
called, Jim Gordon.

473
00:25:54,113 --> 00:25:56,982
It's been far too long
since we've seen each other.

474
00:25:57,016 --> 00:25:59,084
I was beginning to think
you'd forgotten about me.

475
00:25:59,118 --> 00:26:01,186
I need a favor.

476
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,788
Do you know anything about

477
00:26:02,822 --> 00:26:05,056
a narcotics detective by
the name of Arnold Flass?

478
00:26:05,091 --> 00:26:07,192
I've heard the name.

479
00:26:07,226 --> 00:26:09,327
I'm investigating him
and his crew for murder,

480
00:26:09,362 --> 00:26:10,729
but I've hit a wall.

481
00:26:10,763 --> 00:26:12,998
He's too well-connected.
I figured since

482
00:26:13,032 --> 00:26:14,933
Maroni runs the drug trade,

483
00:26:14,967 --> 00:26:18,170
maybe you could find somebody
with the goods on Flass?

484
00:26:18,204 --> 00:26:19,371
But...

485
00:26:19,405 --> 00:26:22,808
Say no more.

486
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:24,676
Favor is done.

487
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,912
I'll make some calls.

488
00:26:26,946 --> 00:26:29,448
And what do I owe you in return?

489
00:26:29,482 --> 00:26:31,550
Friends don't owe friends, silly.

490
00:26:31,584 --> 00:26:35,053
They just do favors
because they want to.

491
00:26:35,088 --> 00:26:37,589
Because they're friends.

492
00:26:37,623 --> 00:26:39,925
- Nobody gets hurt.
- Of course.

493
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:41,626
No one gets hurt.

494
00:26:44,931 --> 00:26:47,799
Champagne.

495
00:27:10,189 --> 00:27:12,090
Dear me.

496
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:14,126
What happened here?

497
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,728
Call Falcone.

498
00:27:16,762 --> 00:27:17,729
No kidding.

499
00:27:23,402 --> 00:27:24,402
Thank you.

500
00:27:24,437 --> 00:27:26,204
Thank you, boys. Lovely.

501
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:28,907
No. I-I am dancing still.

502
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:32,410
- You may go.
- Why you make them go?

503
00:27:32,445 --> 00:27:36,381
Gabe, on your way to
help my dear friend Jim,

504
00:27:36,415 --> 00:27:40,485
could you be a gentleman
and take Mother home?

505
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,654
Sure thing, boss.

506
00:27:42,688 --> 00:27:44,389
Come on, Mrs. K.

507
00:27:44,423 --> 00:27:45,957
A palace.

508
00:27:45,992 --> 00:27:47,859
My boy has a palace.

509
00:27:47,894 --> 00:27:51,763
Such a good boy.

510
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:54,633
Don't worry.

511
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:57,035
I will be back.

512
00:28:45,051 --> 00:28:48,420
Ladies and gentlemen, friends,

513
00:28:48,454 --> 00:28:51,890
celebrities from around the world,

514
00:28:51,924 --> 00:28:55,527
my name is Oswald Cobblepot.

515
00:28:56,562 --> 00:28:58,296
Here we are at last.

516
00:28:58,331 --> 00:29:01,399
It is with deep and sincere pleasure

517
00:29:01,434 --> 00:29:04,703
that I bid you welcome to
the official grand opening

518
00:29:04,737 --> 00:29:06,805
of my newest night spot, the...

519
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:13,278
Not bad.

520
00:29:13,312 --> 00:29:15,881
I do believe you need
to project more.

521
00:29:15,915 --> 00:29:19,684
Just to create a bit more
excitement for the audience.

522
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:22,854
Ladies and gentlemen,

523
00:29:22,889 --> 00:29:27,492
welcome to Fish Mooney's!

524
00:29:29,095 --> 00:29:30,929
Like that.

525
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,973
What kind of

526
00:29:54,008 --> 00:29:56,409
weirdo plays chess with himself?

527
00:29:58,813 --> 00:30:02,615
Don't you have a butler to do
that kind of stuff with you?

528
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,551
He's making lunch.

529
00:30:04,585 --> 00:30:05,752
I got your message.

530
00:30:05,786 --> 00:30:07,387
I'm glad you're safe.

531
00:30:08,489 --> 00:30:10,890
Alfred made me go out of town.

532
00:30:10,925 --> 00:30:13,693
Switzerland. We have a house there.

533
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,261
Chalet, I guess.

534
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,629
A chalet?

535
00:30:16,664 --> 00:30:18,231
It's basically a house.

536
00:30:18,265 --> 00:30:19,733
Why did you want to see me?

537
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:22,002
We're friends, aren't we?

538
00:30:22,036 --> 00:30:24,504
You've been driving
around looking for me,

539
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:27,340
sending messages. What's up?

540
00:30:33,648 --> 00:30:35,649
I got you a present.

541
00:30:47,695 --> 00:30:49,362
It looks like the town we stayed in.

542
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:53,500
Thank you.

543
00:30:53,534 --> 00:30:57,604
Also, I wanted to know if,
if you wanted to stay here

544
00:30:57,638 --> 00:30:59,039
in my house.

545
00:30:59,073 --> 00:31:00,640
Why?

546
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:02,809
I figure we can help each other out.

547
00:31:02,843 --> 00:31:05,378
You can help me find the
man who killed my parents,

548
00:31:05,413 --> 00:31:08,515
and I can give you a
better place to live.

549
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:10,684
What's better about it?

550
00:31:15,389 --> 00:31:19,459
Listen kid... chill.

551
00:31:19,493 --> 00:31:21,595
I came here to tell
you to stop hassling me.

552
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:27,267
Hassling you?

553
00:31:27,301 --> 00:31:29,669
Yeah.

554
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:31,371
You're beginning to bug me.

555
00:31:33,407 --> 00:31:36,142
I thought we were friends.

556
00:31:37,178 --> 00:31:40,780
Listen, I lied.

557
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,083
I... didn't see who
killed your parents.

558
00:31:43,117 --> 00:31:45,118
I didn't see his face.

559
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,987
I don't understand.

560
00:31:47,021 --> 00:31:49,489
I lied so I wouldn't
get locked up in juvie.

561
00:31:49,523 --> 00:31:50,924
So it's no use

562
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:53,126
buying me presents or
sending me messages

563
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,394
or trying to hang out.

564
00:31:54,428 --> 00:31:56,429
There's no point because
I can't help you.

565
00:32:08,442 --> 00:32:10,877
Pinky Littlefield was
light two weeks running.

566
00:32:10,912 --> 00:32:12,679
If you don't pay up,
there's consequences.

567
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:14,447
Flass killed him to send a message.

568
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:16,516
But please, please! I
swear that's all I know.

569
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,350
You sure?

570
00:32:17,385 --> 00:32:19,119
I swear, man, I swear!

571
00:32:19,153 --> 00:32:21,087
I believe you.

572
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:26,526
But I think I'll need
something a bit more tangible.

573
00:32:26,561 --> 00:32:28,495
No, no, no! Please, no!

574
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:29,963
No! No! Please, no!

575
00:32:29,997 --> 00:32:32,732
I swear, man! I swear!

576
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:38,638
How are you liking
show business now?

577
00:32:38,673 --> 00:32:40,106
Please, Miss Mooney.

578
00:32:40,141 --> 00:32:41,775
You're making a mistake.

579
00:32:44,178 --> 00:32:46,746
I beg of you, let me speak.

580
00:32:46,781 --> 00:32:48,481
I know we've had our differences.

581
00:32:49,483 --> 00:32:52,819
We could combine our forces.

582
00:32:52,853 --> 00:32:54,888
Think how'd we fool everyone.

583
00:32:54,922 --> 00:32:57,424
Me... work with you?

584
00:32:58,793 --> 00:33:00,794
I found you.

585
00:33:00,828 --> 00:33:04,631
I made you.

586
00:33:04,665 --> 00:33:08,602
When you walked in here, you
were a sad little wannabe.

587
00:33:08,636 --> 00:33:10,470
Remember that, Butch?

588
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:13,640
You were so afraid.

589
00:33:13,674 --> 00:33:15,442
Shook like a leaf in fall.

590
00:33:15,476 --> 00:33:18,078
You're a servant.

591
00:33:18,112 --> 00:33:20,580
An umbrella boy.

592
00:33:20,615 --> 00:33:24,150
You're... a nobody.

593
00:33:26,153 --> 00:33:29,823
This nobody still
outfoxed you at every turn.

594
00:33:31,893 --> 00:33:34,961
I was working for
Falcone the whole time!

595
00:33:34,996 --> 00:33:37,697
And you didn't have
the sense to see it!

596
00:33:42,136 --> 00:33:43,370
Hello.

597
00:33:43,404 --> 00:33:46,773
Seems like Mooney's is
the place to be today.

598
00:34:01,556 --> 00:34:02,389
Come on, come on!

599
00:34:02,423 --> 00:34:04,357
No! Come on!

600
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:28,048
Go, go, go!

601
00:34:44,765 --> 00:34:46,266
Here.

602
00:34:54,442 --> 00:34:55,442
You got to go!

603
00:34:55,476 --> 00:34:56,910
I'll slow them down.

604
00:34:56,944 --> 00:34:58,845
- No, no!
- Go!

605
00:35:08,656 --> 00:35:10,624
Hello again.

606
00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:21,768
Where is she?

607
00:35:27,141 --> 00:35:28,809
What do you think, girls?

608
00:35:28,843 --> 00:35:31,344
Should we kill him...

609
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,747
or should we take him
home to play with?

610
00:36:01,413 --> 00:36:02,913
Mr. Nygma?

611
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:06,216
Miss Kringle.

612
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:07,651
Am I interrupting?

613
00:36:07,686 --> 00:36:09,620
Yes. I'm surgically
removing the onions

614
00:36:09,654 --> 00:36:11,889
from my takeout, so
if you don't mind...

615
00:36:11,923 --> 00:36:14,658
Mr. Nygma, I owe you an apology.

616
00:36:14,693 --> 00:36:16,927
I didn't give

617
00:36:16,961 --> 00:36:19,363
Arnold the card.

618
00:36:19,397 --> 00:36:21,298
He found it in my desk.

619
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,635
He has a strange sense of humor.

620
00:36:24,669 --> 00:36:27,271
I thought your card was...

621
00:36:27,305 --> 00:36:29,306
very...

622
00:36:31,509 --> 00:36:33,477
thoughtful.

623
00:36:33,511 --> 00:36:34,912
I guess.

624
00:36:34,946 --> 00:36:37,414
Anyway, I'm sorry.

625
00:36:39,451 --> 00:36:41,318
Miss Kringle, would you...

626
00:36:41,353 --> 00:36:43,420
No, no, no, no, no. Please,
don't say anything else.

627
00:36:43,455 --> 00:36:45,289
Just, please.

628
00:36:50,729 --> 00:36:53,297
There's hope.

629
00:36:58,136 --> 00:36:59,937
What's this?

630
00:36:59,971 --> 00:37:02,773
Murder weapon and a tape of
Delaware rolling on Flass.

631
00:37:02,807 --> 00:37:04,675
Smart cookie, that one.

632
00:37:04,709 --> 00:37:06,977
Flass gave him the ice
pick to throw away.

633
00:37:07,012 --> 00:37:09,513
Delaware kept it in case
he had to cover his own ass.

634
00:37:10,548 --> 00:37:12,516
Thank you.

635
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,551
You're welcome.

636
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,151
Master Bruce?

637
00:37:49,187 --> 00:37:50,754
She was lying.

638
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:55,959
I see.

639
00:37:57,962 --> 00:37:59,730
Shall I get a broom, then?

640
00:37:59,764 --> 00:38:01,899
Or would you rather continue crying

641
00:38:01,933 --> 00:38:05,703
over the shattered
fragments of your...

642
00:38:05,737 --> 00:38:07,705
young dreams?

643
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:16,547
Yes, Alfred.

644
00:38:16,581 --> 00:38:18,248
A broom.

645
00:38:18,283 --> 00:38:20,250
Very good, Master Bruce.

646
00:38:27,158 --> 00:38:29,293
I'll find other leads.

647
00:38:29,327 --> 00:38:30,894
No doubt.

648
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:39,370
I knew she was a wrong 'un.

649
00:38:44,242 --> 00:38:46,744
Arnold Flass.

650
00:38:48,913 --> 00:38:51,649
You're under arrest for
the murder of Leon Winkler.

651
00:38:51,683 --> 00:38:54,284
Keep walking, mutt. You got nothing.

652
00:39:01,826 --> 00:39:04,995
That's 20 years upstate right there.

653
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,298
Delaware gave you up.

654
00:39:07,332 --> 00:39:08,966
Jimbo...

655
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,436
you really think these guys
are gonna let you arrest me?

656
00:39:14,472 --> 00:39:15,839
<i>These are my friends.</i>

657
00:39:15,874 --> 00:39:17,408
<i>This is my house.</i>

658
00:39:17,442 --> 00:39:18,909
This is not your house.

659
00:39:18,944 --> 00:39:21,645
You're a drug dealer and a murderer.

660
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,980
You don't belong here.

661
00:39:23,014 --> 00:39:24,515
You don't deserve the badge.

662
00:39:26,117 --> 00:39:27,518
You believe this crap?

663
00:39:27,552 --> 00:39:29,320
How long you been here?

664
00:39:29,354 --> 00:39:31,288
A few months?

665
00:39:31,323 --> 00:39:32,923
Why don't you come preach to me

666
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:34,224
in five years?

667
00:39:40,665 --> 00:39:42,533
He murdered Leon Winkler,

668
00:39:42,567 --> 00:39:46,303
an innocent man who trusted us!

669
00:39:47,806 --> 00:39:49,640
Who trusted this.

670
00:39:54,312 --> 00:39:57,614
Enough to step forward
and help us solve a case.

671
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,818
A man who died so Detective Flass

672
00:40:00,852 --> 00:40:02,853
could protect himself.

673
00:40:02,887 --> 00:40:05,456
I.A. ruled it a suicide.

674
00:40:08,093 --> 00:40:09,393
I'm arresting this man.

675
00:40:09,427 --> 00:40:11,795
Get real, dumb-ass. I'm protected.

676
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,397
You can help me
or you can try and stop me.

677
00:40:13,431 --> 00:40:14,865
Either way,

678
00:40:14,899 --> 00:40:16,433
I'm doing my duty.

679
00:40:16,468 --> 00:40:17,835
Back off, all right?!

680
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:19,236
I'm protected! Get out of here.

681
00:40:19,271 --> 00:40:20,504
Shut up, Flass.

682
00:40:26,011 --> 00:40:29,546
Arnold Flass, you're
under arrest for murder.

683
00:40:34,352 --> 00:40:36,720
The hell do you think
you're doing? Are you crazy?

684
00:40:36,755 --> 00:40:38,455
Read him his rights.

685
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:40,391
You have the right to remain silent.

686
00:40:40,425 --> 00:40:42,092
Anything you say can and
will be used against you...

687
00:40:42,127 --> 00:40:44,028
You can't keep me in here!

688
00:40:44,062 --> 00:40:46,196
You know how many people I got?

689
00:40:51,636 --> 00:40:53,537
Thanks, Cap.

690
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,631
Here.

691
00:41:23,501 --> 00:41:26,203
So what's the plan?

692
00:41:26,237 --> 00:41:29,873
I'm gonna leave town,
lay low for a while.

693
00:41:29,908 --> 00:41:33,577
Then I'm gonna come
back and kill Penguin

694
00:41:33,611 --> 00:41:34,945
when the time is right.

695
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,413
Listen,

696
00:41:36,448 --> 00:41:40,250
you know I have your
best interests at heart.

697
00:41:40,285 --> 00:41:42,386
- Don't come back.
- No.

698
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:45,155
You will see me again.

699
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:48,158
And in the meantime, do me a favor.

700
00:41:48,193 --> 00:41:50,194
Find Butch.

701
00:41:52,364 --> 00:41:54,264
And if he's alive, help him.

702
00:41:54,299 --> 00:41:56,834
I will.

703
00:41:58,837 --> 00:42:01,138
See you soon.

704
00:42:01,172 --> 00:42:03,340
Be good.

705
00:42:10,281 --> 00:42:13,217
Always.

706
00:42:40,312 --> 00:42:42,446
Good night.

707
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,048
Night, Detective.

708
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:47,217
Yo.

709
00:42:47,252 --> 00:42:49,153
That big guy visit you?

710
00:42:49,187 --> 00:42:51,155
Give you the package I sent?

711
00:42:51,189 --> 00:42:52,990
Yeah. Thanks. That was...

712
00:42:53,024 --> 00:42:54,992
Yo, this... so this
means we're even?

713
00:42:55,026 --> 00:42:56,994
I ratted out Flass like you wanted.

714
00:42:57,028 --> 00:42:58,829
So now you back off, right?

715
00:42:58,863 --> 00:43:00,831
Nothing more is gonna
happen to my wife?

716
00:43:00,865 --> 00:43:02,533
She's safe? My family's safe?

717
00:43:02,567 --> 00:43:04,201
I don't understand what
you're talking about.

718
00:43:04,235 --> 00:43:06,470
Okay, okay, no worries.

719
00:43:06,504 --> 00:43:07,538
Look,

720
00:43:07,572 --> 00:43:09,173
never mind I pressed.

721
00:43:09,207 --> 00:43:11,241
I won't say nothing to no one.

722
00:43:11,276 --> 00:43:14,178
I'll-I'll pretend this
conversation never happened.

723
00:43:14,212 --> 00:43:16,080
Okay? Just...

724
00:43:16,114 --> 00:43:18,582
keep my wife and kids out of it.

725
00:43:18,617 --> 00:43:20,618
I'm-I'm begging you.

726
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:27,891
Please.

727
00:43:27,926 --> 00:43:31,180
Please! Please!

728
00:43:31,181 --> 00:43:38,992
