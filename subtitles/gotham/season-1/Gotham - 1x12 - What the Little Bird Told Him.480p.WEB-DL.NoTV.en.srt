1
00:00:01,019 --> 00:00:02,280
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:02,325 --> 00:00:04,826
I wish something would
happen to old man Falcone.

3
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:06,294
Who would take over then?

4
00:00:06,329 --> 00:00:08,130
Let me guess.

5
00:00:08,164 --> 00:00:09,998
Maroni had nothing to
do with the armory job.

6
00:00:10,032 --> 00:00:12,167
You have a mole, obviously.

7
00:00:12,201 --> 00:00:14,469
Someone close to you.

8
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:15,470
Arkham Asylum?

9
00:00:15,505 --> 00:00:17,205
Security guard for nut jobs?

10
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,540
Criminal nut jobs, yeah.

11
00:00:18,574 --> 00:00:20,976
Metal needles were
inserted into the brain,

12
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,311
and electricity was applied
to his frontal lobes.

13
00:00:23,346 --> 00:00:24,780
I want you to find out which one

14
00:00:24,814 --> 00:00:26,948
of our inmates did this.

15
00:00:26,983 --> 00:00:28,617
Well done, Aaron.

16
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:31,286
Exactly like I told you.

17
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,823
Now, you are my
best work so far.

18
00:01:24,407 --> 00:01:26,675
No. No, no.

19
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:28,744
The merchandise
has got to be mint,

20
00:01:28,778 --> 00:01:30,445
or you won't get a dime.

21
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:45,060
My God.

22
00:01:45,094 --> 00:01:46,862
Jack.

23
00:01:46,896 --> 00:01:48,730
Hi, Irwin.

24
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:51,533
Where's my stuff?

25
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:55,337
Aaron Danzig.

26
00:01:55,371 --> 00:01:56,905
Six-four, 225.

27
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,641
Mental age of a young child.

28
00:01:59,676 --> 00:02:02,878
We believe he's under
the control of this man,

29
00:02:02,912 --> 00:02:04,813
Jack Gruber.

30
00:02:04,847 --> 00:02:06,848
In Arkham off a
rape/murder beef.

31
00:02:06,883 --> 00:02:08,950
We can't find any
records on Gruber

32
00:02:08,985 --> 00:02:10,419
prior to his incarceration,

33
00:02:10,453 --> 00:02:12,487
so we're guessing
Gruber is an alias.

34
00:02:12,522 --> 00:02:13,622
We're sending his
prints nationwide,

35
00:02:13,656 --> 00:02:16,024
see if we can find
another name for him.

36
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:19,428
Whoever he is, he's
clever and angry

37
00:02:19,462 --> 00:02:21,797
and a grave public menace.

38
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:24,433
The commissioner
is deeply concerned,

39
00:02:24,467 --> 00:02:25,901
and he's on his way here

40
00:02:25,935 --> 00:02:28,236
to talk to all of you right now.

41
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:30,939
You know what that
means. And you know...

42
00:02:33,176 --> 00:02:34,543
Jim?

43
00:02:34,577 --> 00:02:35,644
Captain.

44
00:02:35,678 --> 00:02:36,979
Hey, partner.

45
00:02:37,013 --> 00:02:39,147
- Hi.
- You're out of your jurisdiction.

46
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:40,716
Captain, this is my case.

47
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,618
Jim, you need to
get out of here.

48
00:02:42,652 --> 00:02:44,586
- It's my case.
- No, no, no.

49
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,988
The captain is right.

50
00:02:46,022 --> 00:02:48,624
You need to leave before
the commissioner gets here.

51
00:02:48,658 --> 00:02:49,825
Why?

52
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:51,593
Because he holds you
responsible for all of this,

53
00:02:51,628 --> 00:02:52,794
and... oh, fudge.

54
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:54,262
He's here.

55
00:02:54,297 --> 00:02:55,364
And you're there. Sidestep.

56
00:02:58,968 --> 00:03:00,936
Captain Essen.

57
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,037
Good morning, Commissioner.

58
00:03:02,071 --> 00:03:04,072
Officer Gordon, isn't it?

59
00:03:08,211 --> 00:03:09,845
Yes, sir.

60
00:03:10,847 --> 00:03:14,516
- Why are you here?
- I have a better question.

61
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,485
Why are you here, Commissioner?

62
00:03:17,487 --> 00:03:19,721
- Excuse me?
- This is the first

63
00:03:19,756 --> 00:03:23,258
I've seen you down here
with the rank and file.

64
00:03:23,293 --> 00:03:25,294
You must be desperate.

65
00:03:26,496 --> 00:03:28,230
Follow me.

66
00:03:31,401 --> 00:03:32,668
Really nice knowing you.

67
00:03:32,702 --> 00:03:34,169
Bring you friend Bullock.

68
00:03:34,203 --> 00:03:35,871
: I hate you.

69
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,820
I hate you.

70
00:03:41,644 --> 00:03:43,645
It wasn't my idea;
it was your friend.

71
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,113
He came up with
the double-cross,

72
00:03:45,148 --> 00:03:46,581
made me go along.

73
00:03:46,616 --> 00:03:48,717
You have a mind of
your own, don't you?

74
00:03:48,751 --> 00:03:49,851
Hey, come on.

75
00:03:52,722 --> 00:03:54,589
See?

76
00:03:54,624 --> 00:03:57,059
I kept your gadgets safe.

77
00:03:58,061 --> 00:04:00,228
I know what it means to you,

78
00:04:00,263 --> 00:04:01,797
all your experiments.

79
00:04:01,831 --> 00:04:03,832
Oh, I appreciate that.

80
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:08,337
Please.

81
00:04:08,371 --> 00:04:10,305
You don't have to kill me.

82
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,240
I don't...

83
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:16,211
have to do anything.

84
00:04:16,245 --> 00:04:18,280
I'm free.

85
00:04:18,314 --> 00:04:20,215
You know the funny thing?

86
00:04:20,249 --> 00:04:23,151
I think it was my time
in Arkham that freed me.

87
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,072
I mean,

88
00:04:25,951 --> 00:04:26,957
in here.

89
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:30,092
Now I see

90
00:04:30,126 --> 00:04:32,694
the world for what it really is.

91
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:35,764
An abandoned factory
full of broken machines.

92
00:04:35,798 --> 00:04:37,766
Some...

93
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,068
Very few...

94
00:04:40,103 --> 00:04:42,738
Can be fixed.

95
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:45,374
Most...

96
00:04:45,408 --> 00:04:48,777
just have to be scrapped.

97
00:04:48,811 --> 00:04:51,747
Danzig, hold him, please.

98
00:04:54,584 --> 00:04:56,051
Please.

99
00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:58,453
Please, no, stop. Please.

100
00:04:58,488 --> 00:05:01,757
Please! Please!

101
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,126
Two maniacs on the loose
makes the whole Arkham Project

102
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,294
look kind of shady, huh?

103
00:05:05,328 --> 00:05:07,929
The moneymen want
results fast, I bet.

104
00:05:07,964 --> 00:05:10,065
You're strangely self-righteous,
given that it was you

105
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:11,700
that let these men escape.

106
00:05:11,734 --> 00:05:13,835
Blame me all you want.
My name's already mud.

107
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,004
Those two will
still be out there,

108
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:17,739
and that means you need me.

109
00:05:17,774 --> 00:05:21,243
James, why did you
become a policeman?

110
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:23,478
Your father was the
district attorney.

111
00:05:23,513 --> 00:05:24,913
A proud station for
a man of substance.

112
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:28,617
You would think that would
inspire a son to practice law.

113
00:05:28,651 --> 00:05:29,851
I'm enforcing the law.

114
00:05:29,886 --> 00:05:31,286
You want to talk about my dad

115
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:32,754
or do you want to
catch Gruber and Danzig?

116
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:35,023
Where do you get the
rebellious fire in your belly?

117
00:05:35,058 --> 00:05:36,191
Can I take
this opportunity

118
00:05:36,225 --> 00:05:39,494
to say that I have no
rebellious fire here, nada.

119
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:41,263
Jack Gruber is out there,

120
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:43,332
planning a catastrophe.

121
00:05:43,366 --> 00:05:44,533
I know the man.

122
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:45,934
I know how he thinks.

123
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:49,004
- I know what he'll do next.
- Which is what?

124
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:51,006
That I'll keep to myself.

125
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,075
I guarantee I'll
bring in these two men,

126
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:55,277
but first, I need
you to reinstate me

127
00:05:55,311 --> 00:05:57,779
as detective first
grade in the GCPD.

128
00:05:57,814 --> 00:06:00,816
Extortion, Officer Gordon.

129
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,618
24 hours?

130
00:06:02,652 --> 00:06:03,719
- What?
- You've got 24 hours

131
00:06:03,753 --> 00:06:05,621
to bring these men in.

132
00:06:05,655 --> 00:06:07,255
You don't, you can
both spend the rest

133
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,890
of your miserable
careers down at Arkham.

134
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:10,926
That will be all, Detectives.

135
00:06:15,698 --> 00:06:18,333
- What the hell just happened?
- It's okay, it's okay.

136
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:19,635
- Everything's gonna be fine, Harvey.
- Yeah?

137
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:21,536
Yeah, we just got to
catch the bad guys.

138
00:06:21,571 --> 00:06:23,272
- Okay, where are we going?
- I don't know.

139
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:27,943
What? You just told him you knew
what Gruber was gonna do next.

140
00:06:27,977 --> 00:06:29,878
I lied.

141
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:17,518
Please, Don Falcone,

142
00:07:17,552 --> 00:07:18,986
have mercy.

143
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,254
We're family.

144
00:07:20,288 --> 00:07:22,356
I know, son.

145
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,558
I know it's hard.

146
00:07:24,592 --> 00:07:26,460
A young man like you,

147
00:07:26,494 --> 00:07:28,295
it doesn't seem fair.

148
00:07:29,464 --> 00:07:31,632
: Please.

149
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,734
Don Falcone, please!

150
00:07:42,577 --> 00:07:46,613
This whole area used to
be slums when I was a boy.

151
00:07:46,648 --> 00:07:49,049
You've come a long way.

152
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:52,019
Some of your people are
looking for you, you know.

153
00:07:52,053 --> 00:07:54,688
But you're the one
I wanted to see.

154
00:07:56,991 --> 00:08:00,828
I've worked so long all
my life to get where I am.

155
00:08:00,862 --> 00:08:04,798
So long, I forget why
I wanted to be here.

156
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:07,000
Well, you wanted to be someone.

157
00:08:07,035 --> 00:08:08,202
And you are.

158
00:08:08,236 --> 00:08:11,138
Look at all the stuff you have.

159
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:16,877
You're a good girl, Liza.

160
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:19,646
You need to find a young
man and get married,

161
00:08:19,681 --> 00:08:21,348
have babies.

162
00:08:21,382 --> 00:08:24,017
It's not fair of me,
keeping you cooped up here,

163
00:08:24,052 --> 00:08:25,185
doing my housework.

164
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,288
You'll never find
a good husband here.

165
00:08:28,323 --> 00:08:31,892
Anyhow, if you'd like
to get out in the world,

166
00:08:31,926 --> 00:08:34,228
I was thinking I
could set you up

167
00:08:34,262 --> 00:08:38,065
with a bakery or some
type of business like that.

168
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:41,702
So you can be independent.

169
00:08:41,736 --> 00:08:43,604
That's really nice, Mr. F.

170
00:08:43,638 --> 00:08:45,105
Thank you.

171
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:47,441
But I would rather
be here with you.

172
00:08:47,475 --> 00:08:49,243
You would?

173
00:08:49,277 --> 00:08:50,644
I like it here.

174
00:08:52,413 --> 00:08:54,615
You make me feel safe.

175
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:56,450
Well, good.

176
00:08:56,484 --> 00:08:58,619
I like having you here.

177
00:08:58,653 --> 00:09:00,921
Yeah.

178
00:09:00,955 --> 00:09:03,657
Maybe I'll try to get a
little work done before dinner.

179
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,161
I'm making something
special tonight.

180
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,417
What are you laughing at?

181
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:31,718
Ah, it's good to be back.

182
00:09:31,753 --> 00:09:34,488
Only a man from a lunatic
asylum would say that.

183
00:09:34,522 --> 00:09:35,756
You're like a human
roller coaster,

184
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,157
except you only go down.

185
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:39,059
Wouldn't that make him
more of an elevator?

186
00:09:39,093 --> 00:09:40,194
You have anything useful, Ed?

187
00:09:40,228 --> 00:09:42,930
I got a little less than 20
hours before I lose my job.

188
00:09:42,964 --> 00:09:45,566
- I do... have something useful.
- And it is?

189
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,934
I cross-checked fingerprints.

190
00:09:46,968 --> 00:09:49,403
The clinically
insane Jack Gruber

191
00:09:49,437 --> 00:09:51,705
of Arkham is a
figment of the files.

192
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:53,407
The man himself is
really a career criminal

193
00:09:53,441 --> 00:09:55,609
by the name Jack Buchinsky.

194
00:09:55,643 --> 00:09:57,244
How is that even possible?

195
00:09:57,278 --> 00:09:58,946
Easy enough to bribe someone
to change the records.

196
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,948
Yep, apparently, he wanted
to be transferred to Arkham.

197
00:10:00,982 --> 00:10:03,150
That's really good work, Ed.

198
00:10:03,184 --> 00:10:04,585
What's this Buttinsky's deal?

199
00:10:04,619 --> 00:10:07,087
Uh, it's, uh,

200
00:10:07,121 --> 00:10:08,188
Buchinsky.

201
00:10:08,223 --> 00:10:10,224
It's all in the files.

202
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:12,826
Just make sure you sign it out.

203
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:14,695
It's classified information,
so just be careful.

204
00:10:14,729 --> 00:10:16,163
Miss Kringle?

205
00:10:18,132 --> 00:10:20,968
I believe you left
this on my desk.

206
00:10:21,002 --> 00:10:22,102
It's a riddle.

207
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:25,239
It's a cupcake

208
00:10:25,273 --> 00:10:27,641
with a live bullet
sticking out of it.

209
00:10:27,675 --> 00:10:28,775
It's a riddle.

210
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,513
It's menacing and
weird and inedible.

211
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,184
Thank you for the
files, Miss Kringle.

212
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:39,753
This Buchinsky
dude and his partners

213
00:10:39,787 --> 00:10:41,688
pulled four successful
bank robberies,

214
00:10:41,723 --> 00:10:44,725
killed six along the way
before the GCPD caught him

215
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:45,959
by accident.

216
00:10:45,994 --> 00:10:47,161
He never named his accomplices.

217
00:10:47,195 --> 00:10:48,295
He's in prison,

218
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:50,063
he hears Arkham is
opening its doors,

219
00:10:50,098 --> 00:10:52,065
so he uses his connections,

220
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,700
and he gets himself
a new identity

221
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:55,569
as the mental patient Gruber.

222
00:10:55,603 --> 00:10:56,904
He must have some
good connections.

223
00:10:56,938 --> 00:10:58,739
Right, and when the rest
of the nuts get transferred

224
00:10:58,773 --> 00:10:59,907
to Arkham... voilà.

225
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:01,909
So, he had partners, huh?

226
00:11:01,943 --> 00:11:03,310
Yeah, GCPD never
identified them.

227
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:04,478
They're still out there.

228
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:07,281
Yep, we find them,
we'll find him.

229
00:11:07,315 --> 00:11:09,683
Easy enough, huh?

230
00:11:09,717 --> 00:11:11,585
Detective.

231
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,555
A hit.

232
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,027
What do we got?

233
00:11:20,061 --> 00:11:22,362
Lead detectives dusted
for prints, two sets...

234
00:11:22,397 --> 00:11:24,398
Gruber and Danzig,
just like we thought.

235
00:11:24,432 --> 00:11:26,400
- Right. Thanks.
- All right.

236
00:11:27,735 --> 00:11:29,303
Van checks out.

237
00:11:29,337 --> 00:11:32,339
It was them.

238
00:11:32,373 --> 00:11:34,508
Our man's an
electronics freak, right?

239
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:36,543
Yeah.

240
00:11:38,813 --> 00:11:40,814
Think he went shopping?

241
00:11:59,868 --> 00:12:01,835
He's dead.

242
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,637
Fried like a doughnut.

243
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:18,485
GCPD.

244
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,521
Turn around slowly,
let me see those hands.

245
00:12:22,524 --> 00:12:24,491
Hey.

246
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:28,495
Hey, buddy.

247
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,531
Hey. Hey!

248
00:12:55,657 --> 00:12:56,957
Help, help! Please!

249
00:12:56,991 --> 00:12:58,959
Get back in the store.

250
00:12:58,993 --> 00:13:00,327
Okay. Take it easy. Okay.

251
00:13:03,164 --> 00:13:05,132
Please, there's been
a terrible mistake.

252
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,434
I am Don Falcone's housekeeper.

253
00:13:07,469 --> 00:13:09,136
Fish?

254
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,971
Thank God.

255
00:13:11,005 --> 00:13:12,973
Why'd you have to
pull me out like that?

256
00:13:13,007 --> 00:13:14,441
You scared the life out of me.

257
00:13:14,476 --> 00:13:16,109
It's time, Liza.

258
00:13:16,144 --> 00:13:18,412
I'm gonna make my
move on Falcone.

259
00:13:18,446 --> 00:13:20,547
And don't be scared, baby girl.

260
00:13:20,582 --> 00:13:22,282
I got this.

261
00:13:29,324 --> 00:13:31,158
SCRAMBLED MALE
Mr. Falcone,

262
00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:33,327
we have your girl, Liza.

263
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:36,830
- Would you like to see her again?
- Yes, I would.

264
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:38,732
She'll be glad to hear that.

265
00:13:38,766 --> 00:13:42,636
For a fit young woman, she
has a low pain threshold.

266
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,338
Please! No!

267
00:13:44,372 --> 00:13:46,006
Stop!

268
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,676
An intermediary will be
in contact with you soon.

269
00:13:49,711 --> 00:13:51,678
Don't hurt her.
She's a civilian.

270
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:55,048
Hello?

271
00:14:02,857 --> 00:14:05,092
What now?

272
00:14:05,126 --> 00:14:08,762
Now we let him sit and think
about his life for a while.

273
00:14:24,283 --> 00:14:26,818
"The Electrocutioner."

274
00:14:26,852 --> 00:14:27,952
Cute.

275
00:14:27,986 --> 00:14:29,120
No pressure.

276
00:14:29,154 --> 00:14:30,455
Don't worry, we'll get him.

277
00:14:30,489 --> 00:14:31,889
Yeah, and we got
17 hours to do so.

278
00:14:31,924 --> 00:14:32,890
I love the name.

279
00:14:32,925 --> 00:14:34,559
It's catchy, has drama.

280
00:14:34,593 --> 00:14:36,794
The Electro-cutioner.

281
00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:38,796
Speaking of which, given
the general mode of attack,

282
00:14:38,831 --> 00:14:41,833
may I suggest you
both wear your...

283
00:14:41,867 --> 00:14:43,701
department-issue galoshes
while you're out in the field.

284
00:14:43,735 --> 00:14:45,036
Galoshes?

285
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,672
In the event of
electrical misadventure,

286
00:14:47,706 --> 00:14:49,340
your footwear
should be insulated.

287
00:14:49,374 --> 00:14:50,508
No, Mom!

288
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:52,310
I'm not gonna wear my
rubbers on the case.

289
00:14:52,344 --> 00:14:54,345
Nygma, give 'em here.

290
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:56,714
Seriously?

291
00:15:02,087 --> 00:15:04,055
All right,
so what do we know?

292
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:06,891
Gruber wasn't too
happy with Irwin.

293
00:15:06,925 --> 00:15:09,227
Maybe they were partners in
crime, Irwin turned on him,

294
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:10,561
Gruber took the fall.

295
00:15:10,596 --> 00:15:11,596
Detective Gordon.

296
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,031
Dr. Thompkins.

297
00:15:14,066 --> 00:15:16,033
My friends call me Lee.

298
00:15:16,068 --> 00:15:18,436
Congratulations, you
got your job back.

299
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,437
Or not, depending.

300
00:15:19,471 --> 00:15:21,672
- It's good to see you.
- Is it?

301
00:15:23,575 --> 00:15:25,176
I-I know you're caught
up with the escape.

302
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,178
- That's why I'm here.
- Is everything okay?

303
00:15:27,212 --> 00:15:29,013
Must be chaos down there.

304
00:15:29,047 --> 00:15:30,748
We're getting by just
fine. Thanks for asking.

305
00:15:32,151 --> 00:15:35,019
Oh, right, this is my
partner, Harvey Bullock.

306
00:15:35,053 --> 00:15:36,354
Hola.

307
00:15:36,388 --> 00:15:37,789
Detective Bullock.

308
00:15:37,823 --> 00:15:39,123
Who's your little friend there?

309
00:15:39,158 --> 00:15:40,758
Oh, this is why I'm here.

310
00:15:40,793 --> 00:15:42,860
One of the women in my
wing is a pagan sorceress.

311
00:15:42,895 --> 00:15:43,861
Of course.

312
00:15:43,896 --> 00:15:45,496
She's very popular.

313
00:15:45,531 --> 00:15:47,165
The inmates make dolls
to look like people

314
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,466
that they want to curse.

315
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,568
And then they give it to
the sorceress to curse them.

316
00:15:50,602 --> 00:15:52,236
In exchange for
extra soda and candy.

317
00:15:52,271 --> 00:15:54,105
I curse you all the time.
You never give me candy.

318
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:55,506
I asked her if Gruber

319
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,175
had ever given her
a doll to curse,

320
00:15:57,209 --> 00:15:58,476
and she said yes.

321
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,644
This is the doll.

322
00:15:59,678 --> 00:16:01,245
His name is Mr. M.

323
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,248
You owe me for a double
six-pack of root beer.

324
00:16:04,283 --> 00:16:05,283
Mr. M.?

325
00:16:05,317 --> 00:16:06,617
Mr. M.

326
00:16:06,652 --> 00:16:07,919
Mr. M.

327
00:16:09,388 --> 00:16:11,022
Who does this look like to you?

328
00:16:11,056 --> 00:16:12,657
I tell this
guy, I said, "Maurice...

329
00:16:12,691 --> 00:16:14,325
"we've pulled out half
your freaking teeth.

330
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:15,827
"What the hell are
you waiting for?

331
00:16:15,861 --> 00:16:17,195
The tooth fairy?" Right?

332
00:16:25,537 --> 00:16:26,737
So, what he does...

333
00:16:26,772 --> 00:16:28,339
you know what Maurice
does? He smiles at me.

334
00:16:28,373 --> 00:16:29,607
So I say, "I'm gonna take out

335
00:16:29,641 --> 00:16:31,075
another one, man."
I go to his molar.

336
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,544
I got to get Mario and
Gabe to help me pull it out.

337
00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:34,746
Do excuse me.

338
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,280
Right. So, we're,
like, pulling it,

339
00:16:36,315 --> 00:16:37,415
we're pulling it, right?

340
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:38,750
And finally we get it out.

341
00:16:38,784 --> 00:16:40,418
The thing is this big...

342
00:16:40,452 --> 00:16:41,486
Yes.

343
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,553
Come see me.

344
00:16:42,588 --> 00:16:43,621
I need you.

345
00:16:43,655 --> 00:16:46,357
I'm on my way. What's wrong?

346
00:16:46,391 --> 00:16:48,960
Somebody took
Liza. Come, quickly.

347
00:16:56,335 --> 00:16:58,970
You sly devil.

348
00:16:59,004 --> 00:17:01,973
You took her.

349
00:17:02,007 --> 00:17:04,008
You're mine now.

350
00:17:07,012 --> 00:17:09,480
So I'm trying to tell
this guy, "Let him talk."

351
00:17:09,515 --> 00:17:12,016
Because now he's trying to talk,
but now I don't understand him

352
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,484
'cause he's got no teeth, right?

353
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:15,353
So I'm saying, "Let
him talk. Clean him out.

354
00:17:15,387 --> 00:17:16,954
He's gonna tell us something."

355
00:17:16,989 --> 00:17:20,625
Don Maroni, sir, forgive me.

356
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:22,627
Such fun we're having.

357
00:17:22,661 --> 00:17:24,896
But I regret that
I must run away.

358
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,964
If you'll let me.

359
00:17:26,999 --> 00:17:28,332
My mother is sick.

360
00:17:30,035 --> 00:17:31,736
Well, a sick mother's
a sick mother.

361
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,771
Go.

362
00:17:46,952 --> 00:17:48,586
Hey...

363
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,021
Penguin, you all right?

364
00:17:50,055 --> 00:17:51,689
Whoa.

365
00:17:51,723 --> 00:17:53,224
Hey, kid, what are you...?

366
00:17:53,258 --> 00:17:54,559
What's going on here?

367
00:17:57,262 --> 00:17:58,463
Get down!

368
00:18:15,781 --> 00:18:17,415
I don't
know what happened.

369
00:18:17,449 --> 00:18:19,083
It was like a silent bomb.

370
00:18:19,118 --> 00:18:20,685
You know who did this, right?

371
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:22,353
Who?

372
00:18:22,387 --> 00:18:23,888
A few years ago, Jack Buchinsky

373
00:18:23,922 --> 00:18:26,257
and partners unknown
knocked over four banks.

374
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,126
Killed six people.

375
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,627
Buchinsky went down for life.

376
00:18:29,661 --> 00:18:32,964
His partners were never caught.

377
00:18:32,998 --> 00:18:35,133
You're one of those partners.

378
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:38,269
The one that took his share and
sold him up the river, I expect.

379
00:18:38,303 --> 00:18:40,638
What guy was this?

380
00:18:40,672 --> 00:18:42,306
Bu... uh...

381
00:18:42,341 --> 00:18:44,308
Who?

382
00:18:44,343 --> 00:18:46,644
While he's out there
looking to hurt you,

383
00:18:46,678 --> 00:18:49,580
he doesn't care
who else he hurts.

384
00:18:49,615 --> 00:18:51,582
Women, kids.

385
00:18:51,617 --> 00:18:52,750
Hey.

386
00:18:52,785 --> 00:18:54,218
That's not my fault.

387
00:18:56,255 --> 00:18:58,256
Help me do the right
thing here, Don Maroni.

388
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:03,461
Let me place you in
protective custody.

389
00:19:03,495 --> 00:19:06,531
- Protective custody?
- Yes.

390
00:19:06,565 --> 00:19:07,665
Bait, you mean.

391
00:19:09,368 --> 00:19:11,135
We catch our bad guy,

392
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,637
you get rid of a
dangerous nuisance.

393
00:19:12,671 --> 00:19:13,805
We both come out ahead.

394
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:15,807
Excuse me.

395
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:17,475
Hello?

396
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:19,610
I... must be going.

397
00:19:19,645 --> 00:19:21,846
Very urgent business.

398
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,881
W-W-With Falcone.

399
00:19:38,697 --> 00:19:41,199
All right, make
yourself at home.

400
00:19:49,308 --> 00:19:50,675
Hey, sweetheart.

401
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:52,844
Get me a double
espresso. Extra sugar.

402
00:19:52,878 --> 00:19:53,878
Nah.

403
00:20:25,206 --> 00:20:27,007
I'm Barbara.

404
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:30,010
Barbara Kean.

405
00:20:30,044 --> 00:20:31,911
My parents, they live here.

406
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:45,258
It's very nice to
see you, Barbara.

407
00:20:45,293 --> 00:20:47,260
Isn't it, Everett?

408
00:20:48,296 --> 00:20:50,263
Yes, very nice.

409
00:20:50,298 --> 00:20:53,400
It's nice to see you, too.

410
00:20:53,434 --> 00:20:56,336
You've been well, I hope?

411
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,672
Yes.

412
00:20:58,706 --> 00:20:59,940
And you?

413
00:20:59,974 --> 00:21:01,541
Splendid.

414
00:21:03,077 --> 00:21:04,577
Are you staying the night?

415
00:21:05,947 --> 00:21:08,081
Uh, if that's all right.

416
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:10,417
In fact, um...

417
00:21:10,451 --> 00:21:12,419
I-I thought maybe I
could stay a few days.

418
00:21:12,453 --> 00:21:14,454
If that's...

419
00:21:16,457 --> 00:21:18,558
Oh, I see.

420
00:21:18,592 --> 00:21:20,560
Yes, of course.

421
00:21:20,594 --> 00:21:23,897
I'm sure you're going
to be frightfully bored.

422
00:21:23,931 --> 00:21:26,232
But stay until the weekend.

423
00:21:26,267 --> 00:21:28,401
By all means.

424
00:21:28,436 --> 00:21:30,437
Thank you.

425
00:21:30,471 --> 00:21:33,039
How's that young man of yours?

426
00:21:33,074 --> 00:21:34,708
James?

427
00:21:34,742 --> 00:21:36,710
The policeman?

428
00:21:36,744 --> 00:21:38,144
All well, I hope?

429
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:41,147
Yes.

430
00:21:41,182 --> 00:21:43,717
He's well, thank you.

431
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:46,620
Good.

432
00:21:46,654 --> 00:21:49,823
We're very happy.

433
00:21:49,857 --> 00:21:51,858
Very happy.

434
00:21:59,934 --> 00:22:01,334
You guys are, like,
hungry for this.

435
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:03,003
What do you guys do
here for excitement?

436
00:22:03,037 --> 00:22:04,938
Remember that joke about
the, uh, what is it?

437
00:22:04,972 --> 00:22:07,474
The two cops and the undertaker
that go on a fishing boat.

438
00:22:07,508 --> 00:22:09,342
When you use a
tethered goat as bait,

439
00:22:09,377 --> 00:22:12,612
shouldn't the goat be out in
the jungle and not in the house?

440
00:22:12,647 --> 00:22:16,249
This house is the
best-defended spot in Gotham.

441
00:22:16,284 --> 00:22:20,020
Buchinsky is crazy and
arrogant and resourceful.

442
00:22:20,054 --> 00:22:22,756
Wherever Maroni is,
he'll come after him.

443
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,891
He'll enjoy the challenge.

444
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,364
Hey, there.

445
00:22:31,399 --> 00:22:33,199
Hi... hi, boss.

446
00:22:33,234 --> 00:22:34,934
How long have I
been unconscious?

447
00:22:34,969 --> 00:22:36,236
Couple of hours.

448
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,904
Oh, my gosh.

449
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,272
I-I must go.

450
00:22:39,307 --> 00:22:40,640
My-my poor mother...

451
00:22:41,676 --> 00:22:43,576
Your mother can wait.

452
00:22:45,613 --> 00:22:47,847
It's her heart, poor thing.

453
00:22:47,882 --> 00:22:49,282
Valves.

454
00:22:49,317 --> 00:22:52,652
She-she might be
taken at any moment...

455
00:22:54,855 --> 00:22:57,057
But... but, by all means,

456
00:22:57,091 --> 00:22:59,726
of course, she can wait.

457
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,595
When you woke up before,

458
00:23:01,629 --> 00:23:04,798
you said you had
urgent business...

459
00:23:06,867 --> 00:23:08,835
with Falcone.

460
00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:11,404
I did?

461
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:13,406
I said that?

462
00:23:13,441 --> 00:23:15,909
Did I?

463
00:23:27,755 --> 00:23:29,889
Carmine?

464
00:23:29,924 --> 00:23:33,627
Some people have called
me about your girl Liza.

465
00:23:33,661 --> 00:23:35,962
They want me to
help make a deal.

466
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:41,034
I didn't think it
was going to be you.

467
00:23:41,068 --> 00:23:42,636
I'm sorry.

468
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,305
I'm just an intermediary.

469
00:23:45,339 --> 00:23:46,973
I just want to help.

470
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,208
Please, my dear.

471
00:23:48,242 --> 00:23:49,609
Stop.

472
00:23:49,644 --> 00:23:51,411
I know this is you.

473
00:23:51,445 --> 00:23:53,947
Be honest.

474
00:23:53,981 --> 00:23:55,415
It's me.

475
00:23:55,449 --> 00:23:57,417
Of course it is.

476
00:23:57,451 --> 00:24:00,420
How long have I known you?

477
00:24:00,454 --> 00:24:02,389
You're the smart
one in the family.

478
00:24:02,423 --> 00:24:04,090
Didn't I always say so?

479
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:06,092
She won't be hurt.

480
00:24:06,127 --> 00:24:07,427
Leave Gotham.

481
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:10,463
That's all... leave
Gotham, never come back.

482
00:24:10,498 --> 00:24:12,098
You can take her with you.

483
00:24:17,905 --> 00:24:19,673
Agreed.

484
00:24:19,707 --> 00:24:20,740
That's the right decision.

485
00:24:20,775 --> 00:24:23,643
I'll make the arrangements.

486
00:24:23,678 --> 00:24:26,579
You were always my favorite.

487
00:24:26,614 --> 00:24:29,950
Wait for my call.

488
00:24:29,984 --> 00:24:31,585
He's leaving?

489
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:33,653
You did it?

490
00:24:36,123 --> 00:24:37,557
Boss?

491
00:24:37,592 --> 00:24:40,160
The genius! The-the vision!

492
00:24:40,194 --> 00:24:43,863
You brought down the
old man... finally.

493
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:47,173
Let's celebrate.

494
00:24:48,948 --> 00:24:51,096
Butch, this is not
the time to celebrate.

495
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:54,666
He was a great man once.

496
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,569
You don't think somebody would
take him out if he stayed on?

497
00:24:57,603 --> 00:25:01,072
I am doing him a favor and
giving him an easy way out.

498
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:07,379
I owe him at least that.

499
00:25:07,413 --> 00:25:09,047
Of course.

500
00:25:09,081 --> 00:25:10,949
You're right.

501
00:25:10,983 --> 00:25:12,751
It's best for everyone.

502
00:25:14,086 --> 00:25:16,121
How did he sound?

503
00:25:19,425 --> 00:25:21,626
Sad.

504
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:25,096
Look at me.

505
00:25:25,131 --> 00:25:27,966
Is there something
you're not telling me?

506
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,768
No.

507
00:25:31,537 --> 00:25:33,371
You're going to have
to leave town with him,

508
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,939
string him along for a while.

509
00:25:34,974 --> 00:25:36,508
Do you think you can do that?

510
00:25:36,542 --> 00:25:37,942
Sure.

511
00:25:37,977 --> 00:25:39,110
Sure.

512
00:25:40,246 --> 00:25:42,447
But you like him,
though, don't you?

513
00:25:42,481 --> 00:25:45,116
Well, I can like him, can't I?

514
00:25:46,218 --> 00:25:48,887
He's been a perfect gentleman.

515
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:51,122
He could've done anything,

516
00:25:51,157 --> 00:25:53,858
and he never laid a hand on me.

517
00:25:53,893 --> 00:25:56,728
Liza, you can like
him all you want.

518
00:25:56,762 --> 00:26:00,432
But you can never
tell him the truth.

519
00:26:00,466 --> 00:26:03,001
I know that.

520
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:13,111
Sir?

521
00:26:13,145 --> 00:26:15,413
Let me go to work.

522
00:26:16,682 --> 00:26:18,683
No.

523
00:26:19,752 --> 00:26:21,519
"No"?

524
00:26:21,554 --> 00:26:23,254
If Fish and the others...

525
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:26,725
And there must be others...

526
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:28,960
If they all want me
to step away so badly,

527
00:26:28,995 --> 00:26:30,962
maybe it's time.

528
00:26:30,997 --> 00:26:34,532
Why not?

529
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:38,203
Why am I still here fighting?

530
00:26:38,237 --> 00:26:41,306
For what?

531
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,275
For respect.

532
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:48,046
You're Don Carmine Falcone.

533
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,314
"Respect"?

534
00:26:49,348 --> 00:26:53,251
Who cares?

535
00:26:53,286 --> 00:26:54,786
They all want me

536
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,722
to go live in the
country with Liza.

537
00:26:57,757 --> 00:26:59,958
I would like that.

538
00:26:59,992 --> 00:27:03,061
That's what I want, too.

539
00:27:03,095 --> 00:27:05,463
So, why not do it?

540
00:27:07,199 --> 00:27:09,701
Please...

541
00:27:09,735 --> 00:27:11,970
don't talk that way, sir.

542
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:17,075
And just me on my own?

543
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:19,878
I can take out Fish's crew easy.

544
00:27:19,912 --> 00:27:21,546
You're not listening, Victor.

545
00:27:22,581 --> 00:27:26,951
Your job is to keep
me and Liza safe

546
00:27:26,986 --> 00:27:29,054
through the coming transaction.

547
00:27:29,088 --> 00:27:31,056
That's all.

548
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,091
Yes, sir.

549
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:47,105
Miss Kringle?

550
00:27:47,139 --> 00:27:49,774
What?! What?

551
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:52,944
The cupcake is sweet,
the bullet is deadly.

552
00:27:52,979 --> 00:27:55,380
A beautiful woman's
a dangerous thing.

553
00:27:58,384 --> 00:28:00,785
Um, uh, listen, I, uh...

554
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,388
That is so...

555
00:28:03,422 --> 00:28:05,090
I don't...

556
00:28:05,124 --> 00:28:06,958
I don't even know
what to say to that.

557
00:28:06,993 --> 00:28:09,027
Nygma, you perv, back off.

558
00:28:09,061 --> 00:28:10,996
Can't you see the lady
doesn't want you bugging her?

559
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,697
I, um...

560
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,566
Hey, there. Hey, now.
Who's bugging who?

561
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,401
I'm just, I'm just...

562
00:28:16,435 --> 00:28:17,936
What's green and then red?

563
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,371
Frogs in a blender.

564
00:28:19,405 --> 00:28:21,773
Walk away, Nygma.

565
00:28:21,807 --> 00:28:23,942
Walk away.

566
00:28:25,711 --> 00:28:27,712
I'm very sorry if I've
offended you, Miss Kringle.

567
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,814
That was not my intention.

568
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,787
Do you hear that?

569
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:37,155
Go.

570
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,494
Thank you.

571
00:28:42,528 --> 00:28:45,263
He is so weird.

572
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:16,962
I have no
business with Falcone!

573
00:29:16,996 --> 00:29:18,630
I swear on my mother's life!

574
00:29:18,664 --> 00:29:21,266
May God strike her dead
with horrible torment

575
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,867
if I'm lying!

576
00:29:22,902 --> 00:29:24,803
Okay, then, my friend.

577
00:29:24,837 --> 00:29:27,539
I'm sorry I doubted you.

578
00:29:27,573 --> 00:29:29,174
Go see your mom.

579
00:29:29,208 --> 00:29:31,109
Give her a kiss for me.

580
00:29:31,143 --> 00:29:33,144
: Thank you.

581
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,784
Ah.

582
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:55,452
There's the one.

583
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:57,988
Under that funny-looking
fellow there.

584
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,059
Take him to the truck.

585
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:05,796
They didn't cook.

586
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,698
Just stunned.

587
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:10,100
I expected more...

588
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:11,935
oomph!

589
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:16,173
You want "oomph," Jack?

590
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,375
Ah.

591
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:21,845
Officer Gordon.

592
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:24,047
Nice shoes.

593
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:27,184
Detective Gordon.

594
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,052
Hands up, both of you.

595
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:32,456
Uh, you might want to drop that.

596
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,429
Aah!

597
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,905
Why fight me, Gordon?

598
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,641
Who here

599
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:53,110
deserves your protection?

600
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:54,578
Any of them? All of them.

601
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,313
Even Maroni?! Please!

602
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:59,750
Just let me kill
this false friend

603
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:02,486
and get on with my life.

604
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,729
All this fight.

605
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,765
And for what?

606
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,939
I'm putting you
back in Arkham, Jack.

607
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,974
That's closer to the
mark, now, isn't it, Jim?

608
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:25,676
You need to win.

609
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,245
Don't you? You pretend
to care about the law,

610
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,814
but in your heart,
it's all primitive ego.

611
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:34,551
And you lust for
blood and power.

612
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:38,355
You just hate to lose.

613
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,624
You know what? You're right.

614
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:50,000
I do hate to lose.

615
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,771
Hmm.

616
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:08,051
Congratulations, young man.

617
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,087
A new day.

618
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:12,489
New day.

619
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,893
Next man that tries to
take away my shield...

620
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,495
one way or another,

621
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,530
I'm gonna make him eat it.

622
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:23,800
Say again?

623
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,836
New day, Commissioner.

624
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:40,350
I hope you have some
nasty pictures of him,

625
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:41,551
because I bet

626
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,887
what you said was
very, very rude.

627
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:46,490
I'm done being careful.

628
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,558
You think you've
been careful so far?

629
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:50,827
Men like Commissioner Loeb
are never gonna trust me.

630
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,562
You think you've
been careful so far?

631
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:53,830
So why play nice?

632
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,867
You think... you've
been careful so far?

633
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:59,202
Don't worry. I
know what I'm doing.

634
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:00,671
Let's go grab a beer.

635
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,339
Now you're messing with my mind.

636
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,208
I need something
stronger than a beer.

637
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:16,620
Hush, young man.

638
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:19,189
I can hear you sigh.

639
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,859
Sorry, sir.

640
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:33,136
Let him be.

641
00:34:42,566 --> 00:34:44,815
It's good to see
you, old friend.

642
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:48,785
I am so sorry it took
me so long to get here.

643
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,721
Such a day I've had...

644
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,489
I won't even tell you.

645
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:54,791
But I'm here.

646
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:57,461
You were right about Fish.

647
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:59,396
It's her that's taken Liza.

648
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,966
Sir, allow me...

649
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:04,801
I must tell you
what I've discovered.

650
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:08,305
You're not gonna
want to hear this.

651
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:09,640
Speak.

652
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,509
Liza was planted on you by Fish.

653
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:16,680
She belongs to Fish.

654
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:19,616
This was a setup from the start.

655
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:22,019
She found a girl that
looked just like your mother,

656
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,587
and trained her up...

657
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,691
No.

658
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,493
I'm sorry.

659
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,328
- Prove that.
- How?

660
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:34,464
I-I can't.

661
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:35,799
I just know.

662
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:39,202
You're wrong.

663
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:42,339
When have I been wrong?

664
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:54,851
Hello, Fish.

665
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:56,553
Don Falcone.

666
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,422
We will meet at my place.

667
00:35:58,456 --> 00:35:59,890
Acceptable?

668
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:01,892
Yes.

669
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,694
Is she there? Is Liza there now?

670
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:04,828
Can I speak to her?

671
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:06,396
No.

672
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:08,598
What time?

673
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:10,634
In an hour.

674
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,971
I'll be there.

675
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:37,432
Fish.

676
00:36:37,467 --> 00:36:39,868
Don Falcone.

677
00:36:42,872 --> 00:36:44,539
How's this work?

678
00:36:44,574 --> 00:36:46,041
Liza is close by.

679
00:36:46,075 --> 00:36:48,844
All I need for you to
do is sign papers...

680
00:36:48,878 --> 00:36:51,280
Relinquish all control
of the family...

681
00:36:51,314 --> 00:36:53,548
And then you're
both free to leave.

682
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:55,350
Papers?

683
00:36:55,385 --> 00:36:57,286
You think papers make a don?

684
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:00,416
I'm offering you
a way out, Carmine.

685
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:01,851
I appreciate that.

686
00:37:01,885 --> 00:37:03,519
Thank you.

687
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,421
But I need to see her first.

688
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:07,223
Before I sign anything,

689
00:37:07,257 --> 00:37:08,891
I need to know she's all right.

690
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:10,026
She's fine.

691
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:13,262
I need to see her.

692
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:15,131
Or no deal.

693
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,553
Are you all right?

694
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,222
I'm okay.

695
00:37:40,724 --> 00:37:43,459
How long have you
known Fish Mooney?

696
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:46,062
Huh?

697
00:37:46,096 --> 00:37:47,263
I don't.

698
00:37:47,297 --> 00:37:50,166
I just met her now.

699
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:52,668
No.

700
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:55,071
A little bird
told me you and she

701
00:37:55,105 --> 00:37:57,273
have been friends for a while.

702
00:37:57,307 --> 00:37:59,675
No.

703
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,278
Told me that she told
you stuff about my mother

704
00:38:02,312 --> 00:38:05,148
so that I'd get all
caught up in you.

705
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:07,450
Because Fish knows.

706
00:38:07,484 --> 00:38:09,118
You know, about my mother.

707
00:38:10,487 --> 00:38:13,556
You know how much
I loved my mother,

708
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,924
because we talked about her

709
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:16,993
all the time, you and me.

710
00:38:17,027 --> 00:38:19,028
Remember, Fish? Back in the day?

711
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,630
I do.

712
00:38:20,664 --> 00:38:22,231
It seems as though a little bird

713
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,766
has been making
a bit of mischief.

714
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,635
Yes.

715
00:38:25,669 --> 00:38:28,204
That's what I had hoped.

716
00:38:28,238 --> 00:38:30,206
But the truth is plain to see.

717
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,009
I am very disappointed
at my own stupidity.

718
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:52,328
I'm sorry, Liza.

719
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:53,629
Is that your name?

720
00:38:55,432 --> 00:38:56,666
I'm sorry you had to get

721
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,068
mixed up in this,

722
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:00,903
because I'm sure you're a...

723
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:04,140
good, honest girl, really.

724
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,955
No.

725
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:54,190
I want these two alive for now.

726
00:39:54,224 --> 00:39:55,758
Lock them up someplace.

727
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:58,294
Don't bother yelling for help.

728
00:39:58,328 --> 00:39:59,762
All your people are dead.

729
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,097
Carmine...

730
00:40:01,131 --> 00:40:02,465
you have to under...

731
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:05,635
I can forgive

732
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:07,136
all kinds of betrayal

733
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:09,539
and dishonesty.

734
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,873
But my mother?

735
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,975
How dare you use

736
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,977
my sainted mother against me?

737
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:16,746
That's wrong!

738
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,781
You'll suffer for
that. I need you to...

739
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:23,986
Thank you, Fish.

740
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:26,489
For the first time
in a long time,

741
00:40:26,523 --> 00:40:28,591
I feel alive.

742
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:30,927
I remember who I am.

743
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:33,896
I remember why I'm here.

744
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,399
Just... You can come out now.

745
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:49,579
Right, as usual, my friend.

746
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:54,784
Say your good-byes quickly.

747
00:40:54,818 --> 00:40:56,819
Ms. Mooney has places to go.

748
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,567
Hello, Fish.

749
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:39,729
Hi.

750
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:42,065
Dr. Thompkins.

751
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:43,666
Lee.

752
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,503
Lee.

753
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,708
The desk sergeant said it
was okay to come back here.

754
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:53,142
I didn't mean to disturb you.

755
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,243
No, no.

756
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:55,311
It's okay. Something wrong?

757
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,312
No.

758
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,181
Um, I was in the area,

759
00:41:58,215 --> 00:42:01,150
and, um... my sorceress
wants her doll back.

760
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,953
Right, yeah.

761
00:42:03,987 --> 00:42:05,822
Is that why you're here?

762
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,324
Yes.

763
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:12,895
No.

764
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,698
She does want her
doll back, but, um...

765
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:17,900
Not entirely.

766
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,168
No.

767
00:42:24,007 --> 00:42:25,408
You live here?

768
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:28,945
Sort of between
places right now.

769
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:33,483
I don't know why I'm here.

770
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:34,650
Sorry.

771
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:37,020
A whim.

772
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,256
Wait.

773
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:11,087
Hey, Gordon, did you hear?

774
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:16,426
There's been a big shootout
at Fish Mooney's place.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
