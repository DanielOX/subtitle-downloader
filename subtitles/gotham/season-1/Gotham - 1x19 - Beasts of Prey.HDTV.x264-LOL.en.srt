1
00:00:00,722 --> 00:00:02,354
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:02,385 --> 00:00:04,566
I had a meeting with the
board of Wayne Enterprises.

3
00:00:04,817 --> 00:00:06,432
I told them I was investigating them.

4
00:00:06,467 --> 00:00:08,441
So they sent someone
we'd trust to spy on us.

5
00:00:08,504 --> 00:00:10,005
Alfred was stabbed.

6
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:11,640
It was a friend of his from the army.

7
00:00:11,674 --> 00:00:14,184
- What was he looking for?
- Some of my files are missing.

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,578
I could find out who hired
him. He's the key to everything.

9
00:00:16,613 --> 00:00:19,005
I have a plan. I promise you,

10
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,316
I will get some of us out of here alive.

11
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:24,753
- Who are you?
- Dr. Francis Dulmacher.

12
00:00:24,787 --> 00:00:26,955
The people in the basement trust me.

13
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,491
Put me in charge, and I promise you

14
00:00:29,526 --> 00:00:31,604
a dependable flow of healthy product.

15
00:00:31,617 --> 00:00:32,696
And if I fail?

16
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:35,264
Those who fail me still have their uses.

17
00:00:35,298 --> 00:00:36,965
What are they doing?

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,001
I'm sorry, honey, you're on the list.

19
00:00:39,035 --> 00:00:41,370
Half the cops on the GCPD have a Cobblepot,

20
00:00:41,404 --> 00:00:44,006
and Loeb has the goods on all of them.

21
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,675
- That is what Loeb does.
- Well, it ends now.

22
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:47,876
So what do you want?

23
00:00:47,911 --> 00:00:50,111
With the coming election for president

24
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:51,680
of the policeman's union,

25
00:00:51,714 --> 00:00:53,901
there's no man I'd rather support.

26
00:00:53,914 --> 00:00:56,218
It's a new day in the GCPD.

27
00:01:22,927 --> 00:01:25,295
- Hmm, looking good, Ms. Cavanaugh.
- Thank you.

28
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:27,030
- How's that swelling?
- Fine.

29
00:01:27,064 --> 00:01:30,066
If you need more ice
packs, I'll let Denise know.

30
00:01:30,697 --> 00:01:33,136
Mr. Douglas, I know you
don't like your view,

31
00:01:33,171 --> 00:01:35,172
and as soon as a recovery suite is open,

32
00:01:35,206 --> 00:01:37,700
- I'm going to move you.
- Oh.

33
00:02:15,688 --> 00:02:17,447
Is there a problem?

34
00:02:17,482 --> 00:02:20,246
- You're outside.
- You're observant.

35
00:02:20,484 --> 00:02:21,984
I'm the new assistant for the doctor.

36
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:24,453
I'm Fish. And you are?

37
00:02:24,488 --> 00:02:25,922
Inside you're free to roam...

38
00:02:25,956 --> 00:02:28,230
That's Dr. Dulmacher's prerogative...

39
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:32,161
But once you step outside,
you're in my world.

40
00:02:32,339 --> 00:02:35,942
I'm the man who catches the poor
souls brave enough to try to escape.

41
00:02:35,976 --> 00:02:37,877
Ah, you're The Catcher.

42
00:02:37,912 --> 00:02:40,513
I've heard a lot about you.

43
00:02:40,548 --> 00:02:42,916
So, have there been many?

44
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,485
Poor souls, I mean.

45
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,220
No.

46
00:02:47,254 --> 00:02:48,988
The water does most of the work,

47
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:53,059
but every so often, someone gets stupid

48
00:02:53,094 --> 00:02:55,195
and gives it a go.

49
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:57,864
I didn't know I wasn't
supposed to be outside.

50
00:02:57,898 --> 00:02:59,632
My mistake.

51
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:01,501
Make that mistake again,

52
00:03:01,535 --> 00:03:03,803
and it'll be your last.

53
00:03:14,682 --> 00:03:16,783
I saw the papers the other day.

54
00:03:16,817 --> 00:03:19,280
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

55
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,956
So what does president of the
policeman's union do, exactly?

56
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,458
Depends on the president.

57
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:27,727
- I see.
- How's Alfred?

58
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:31,131
W-Whinier than I thought. Mm.

59
00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:33,133
No, he-he's getting better.

60
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:35,301
Glad to hear it.

61
00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:41,574
You two lied about who
stabbed him, didn't you?

62
00:03:43,577 --> 00:03:45,645
That's why you're here?

63
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:48,320
- Is it?
- Yes.

64
00:03:49,617 --> 00:03:51,918
Did you?

65
00:03:52,953 --> 00:03:55,021
Lie to me?

66
00:03:56,424 --> 00:03:58,024
No.

67
00:03:58,059 --> 00:04:00,126
If we don't have a
description of the culprit,

68
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:02,328
we won't find him.

69
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,398
I wish I could help you, Detective.

70
00:04:07,835 --> 00:04:11,438
Alfred wants to go after him on his own.

71
00:04:11,472 --> 00:04:12,839
That's why you lied to me.

72
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:15,408
No.

73
00:04:15,443 --> 00:04:17,777
Bruce, look at me.

74
00:04:17,812 --> 00:04:20,613
Whatever Alfred is up to,
you have to stay out of it.

75
00:04:20,648 --> 00:04:24,150
It's dangerous, and it's not your fight.

76
00:04:24,185 --> 00:04:26,686
I cut this bread way too thick, didn't I?

77
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:28,788
Bruce...

78
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:32,625
I understand what you're saying.

79
00:04:37,231 --> 00:04:39,065
Okay, then.

80
00:04:51,278 --> 00:04:52,579
Detective Gordon,

81
00:04:52,613 --> 00:04:54,814
Len Moore.

82
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:56,816
Officer, what can I help you with?

83
00:04:56,851 --> 00:04:58,960
- You're a man with a reputation.
- Oh, yeah?

84
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,554
A Gotham detective who
actually closes cases.

85
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:03,189
I try.

86
00:05:06,861 --> 00:05:08,895
Uh, that's actually why I'm here.

87
00:05:08,929 --> 00:05:10,563
Oh, yeah?

88
00:05:10,598 --> 00:05:11,731
See, a few weeks ago,

89
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:13,133
I was a first responder to a homicide.

90
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:14,834
Victim's name was Grace Fairchild.

91
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,904
They found her body down by
the river, stabbed to death,

92
00:05:17,938 --> 00:05:19,639
and the detectives who caught the case,

93
00:05:19,674 --> 00:05:21,574
they got nowhere with it and moved on.

94
00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:24,110
I'm sorry to hear that, but it happens.

95
00:05:24,145 --> 00:05:26,579
I was wondering if you could
pick up where they left off.

96
00:05:26,614 --> 00:05:28,581
You want me to take over the case?

97
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:30,383
Yeah.

98
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:32,952
Look, Len, I got a full boat here.

99
00:05:32,987 --> 00:05:36,289
This victim's family, they deserve justice.

100
00:05:36,324 --> 00:05:38,158
- Well, yeah.
- Her killer deserves

101
00:05:38,192 --> 00:05:39,492
to pay for what he did.

102
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:41,561
This was a nasty one.

103
00:05:42,563 --> 00:05:45,031
They're all nasty.
What's your angle on this?

104
00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:48,568
No angle. It's just...

105
00:05:48,602 --> 00:05:50,303
Well, there's a few of us younger guys,

106
00:05:50,338 --> 00:05:52,305
and we've been watching
what you've been doing

107
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,140
to clean up Gotham and the GCPD.

108
00:05:54,175 --> 00:05:58,411
And I want to be a part of
it, and bringing you this case

109
00:05:58,446 --> 00:06:00,347
is my way of trying to do that.

110
00:06:04,585 --> 00:06:06,252
I'll look into it.

111
00:06:16,097 --> 00:06:17,964
Ready to go?

112
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:19,499
Ready?

113
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:20,834
I have been dreaming

114
00:06:20,868 --> 00:06:22,702
about the carbonara at Luccio's all day.

115
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:25,572
- New case?
- Uh, sort of.

116
00:06:25,606 --> 00:06:28,608
It's an unsolved homicide
a uni asked me to look into.

117
00:06:28,643 --> 00:06:31,244
- It's an odd one.
- Ooh, how so?

118
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:33,079
I thought you were hungry?

119
00:06:34,081 --> 00:06:36,816
What can I say? You had me at homicide.

120
00:06:36,851 --> 00:06:40,754
The victim, Grace Fairchild,
was found two weeks ago.

121
00:06:40,788 --> 00:06:42,922
She was reported missing
four months earlier.

122
00:06:42,957 --> 00:06:46,459
Last anyone heard, she,
uh, called her mother.

123
00:06:46,494 --> 00:06:48,361
Said she was having a drink
at a bar in the South Village.

124
00:06:48,396 --> 00:06:51,097
That's my neighborhood. What bar?

125
00:06:51,132 --> 00:06:54,334
Detectives canvassed
the area. Nobody knows.

126
00:06:54,368 --> 00:06:55,535
No leads, no tips.

127
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:57,570
I'm staring to see why
the case was dropped.

128
00:06:57,605 --> 00:06:59,739
God, we were almost the same age.

129
00:06:59,774 --> 00:07:02,475
We could've been friends.

130
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,978
You know, they have a few
speakeasies in the South Village.

131
00:07:05,012 --> 00:07:06,947
It's a new thing.

132
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:09,683
You walk in through a dry cleaners
or a shoe store to get inside.

133
00:07:09,717 --> 00:07:11,685
Easy to miss if you're not in the know.

134
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:13,286
Thanks, I'll check it out.

135
00:07:13,321 --> 00:07:14,888
Good.

136
00:07:14,922 --> 00:07:16,423
I'm glad you're looking into this.

137
00:07:16,457 --> 00:07:19,793
Whoever did this, he's a monster.

138
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,907
Kelly.

139
00:07:33,941 --> 00:07:35,642
Ow.

140
00:07:35,676 --> 00:07:36,876
Shh, shh, shh.

141
00:07:36,911 --> 00:07:37,978
God.

142
00:07:38,012 --> 00:07:39,579
Shh, shh.

143
00:07:39,614 --> 00:07:41,681
Still bad.

144
00:07:41,716 --> 00:07:43,817
What do you want?

145
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:47,053
I have a plan, but I need your help.

146
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:48,989
What plan?

147
00:07:52,693 --> 00:07:54,194
We're going to escape.

148
00:07:54,228 --> 00:07:57,697
I'm getting off of this hell of an island,

149
00:07:57,732 --> 00:07:59,733
or I'm gonna die trying.

150
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:08,200
- Sync and corrections by madhatters -
- www.addic7ed.com -

151
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,736
Alfred?

152
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,210
- Where are you going?
- Into the city, Master Bruce.

153
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:33,611
If I know Reggie,

154
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:36,180
he's probably drunk
himself half to death by now

155
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,984
and is moving swiftly
on to the harder stuff.

156
00:08:40,018 --> 00:08:41,752
I'll probably find him

157
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,722
- holed up in a shooting gallery,
- totally off his maracas.

158
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:46,757
Alfred, you can't go.

159
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:50,561
- You're not well.
- No choice, Master Bruce.

160
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,296
He'll only be here for a few days.

161
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:56,033
Enough time to get his
fix, then he'll be off.

162
00:08:57,669 --> 00:08:59,570
Well, then we better get going.

163
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,739
If you think I'm gonna take you, Master...

164
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,584
Oh, dear.

165
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,127
Good day, Lidia.

166
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,796
Have you thought about my offer?

167
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,266
I told you already, my
place is not for sale.

168
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,736
Please, I beg of you, think again.

169
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,372
I will serve strictly as a silent partner.

170
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,975
You will continue to run
the day-to-day operations.

171
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,512
Che pazzo, I told you already!

172
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,314
Madam, please, I-I meant no harm.

173
00:09:43,348 --> 00:09:45,983
Okay, Mama. You made your point.

174
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,086
Madam, I assure you,

175
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,788
I have a sincere interest
in your establishment.

176
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,825
If money is not what you seek,

177
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:56,828
surely there is something you want.

178
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:02,667
My granddaughter, Antonia,

179
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:04,168
she's beautiful,

180
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,537
virtuous,

181
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:09,340
an angel.

182
00:10:09,374 --> 00:10:12,009
And she has been seduced

183
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:15,179
by a silver-tongued guitar player.

184
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,482
Lucifer himself.

185
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,484
A tragedy.

186
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:22,253
You make her come home,

187
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:25,523
leave this... pappone...

188
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:31,095
then I'll consider your offer.

189
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,431
Madam,

190
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:35,733
she will be home for Sunday Mass.

191
00:10:37,035 --> 00:10:38,469
You have my word.

192
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:46,411
This place is a dump.
Real nickel-and-dime.

193
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,246
It's worth far more than that, Gabe.

194
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,281
You just don't see it yet.

195
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,351
No.

196
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:56,354
I'm not saying we officially take over the
investigation; just help me look into it.

197
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:57,755
No.

198
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,124
Harvey. The victim deserves justice.

199
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,427
Yeah, and I deserve a mute supermodel

200
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,595
who likes pasty Irish
guys and loves to cook.

201
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,797
It's not happening.

202
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,966
Besides, we both know that justice

203
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,135
isn't the real reason you want this one.

204
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,371
- Hello, Detectives.
- Ed, question:

205
00:11:13,405 --> 00:11:17,058
would you rather work more or less?

206
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,985
- Is this a riddle?
- Exactly.

207
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:21,620
You're helping. What's up?

208
00:11:21,654 --> 00:11:23,788
Uh, list of all establishments
in the South Village

209
00:11:23,823 --> 00:11:24,823
with a current liquor license.

210
00:11:24,857 --> 00:11:27,192
- Including speakeasies?
- Yes, siree...

211
00:11:27,226 --> 00:11:28,827
Four of which, you'll be pleased to know,

212
00:11:28,861 --> 00:11:30,729
were missed by the original detectives.

213
00:11:30,763 --> 00:11:31,963
Ah, that's great, Ed. Thanks.

214
00:11:31,998 --> 00:11:32,964
One more thing.

215
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:34,332
I was going through

216
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:36,134
the crime scene evidence
from the Fairchild murder

217
00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:39,137
and, uh, there's a piece
of evidence missing.

218
00:11:39,171 --> 00:11:41,706
- Any idea what it is?
- No,

219
00:11:41,741 --> 00:11:43,608
but it's labeled "3A."
Think you can find it?

220
00:11:43,643 --> 00:11:46,144
Detective, I will solve this puzzle.

221
00:11:52,618 --> 00:11:53,818
You coming?

222
00:11:53,853 --> 00:11:56,855
Let me say it in Spanish:

223
00:11:56,889 --> 00:11:57,889
No.

224
00:11:57,924 --> 00:12:00,358
Okay, look, you're right. I'm ambitious.

225
00:12:00,393 --> 00:12:01,993
I want to show people around here

226
00:12:02,028 --> 00:12:04,629
that things are gonna change.

227
00:12:04,664 --> 00:12:06,731
But, Harvey, I can't do
that without your help.

228
00:12:06,766 --> 00:12:08,099
Look, I know you're riding high,

229
00:12:08,134 --> 00:12:09,768
what with getting over on Loeb and all.

230
00:12:09,802 --> 00:12:13,238
But there's one thing you
should always remember.

231
00:12:13,272 --> 00:12:15,473
Fly too close to the sun,

232
00:12:15,508 --> 00:12:16,908
you're gonna get burned.

233
00:12:16,943 --> 00:12:18,109
You done?

234
00:12:18,144 --> 00:12:19,644
- Yeah.
- Good.

235
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,745
Then get your ass up.

236
00:12:25,218 --> 00:12:26,918
So that's it.

237
00:12:26,953 --> 00:12:29,855
So you're trying to tell me

238
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:31,923
you actually think we can get out of here.

239
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:35,227
That's what I said, didn't I?

240
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:39,097
- How?
- With cunning and guile.

241
00:12:39,131 --> 00:12:42,167
But it won't work without your help.

242
00:12:42,201 --> 00:12:43,602
Well, why us?

243
00:12:43,636 --> 00:12:45,704
Why not your friends?

244
00:12:45,738 --> 00:12:48,573
There's no telling how
this is all going to go down

245
00:12:48,608 --> 00:12:50,008
during the breakout.

246
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:52,143
Just in case it goes south,

247
00:12:52,178 --> 00:12:55,413
I need some stone cold killers by my side,

248
00:12:55,448 --> 00:12:57,015
not some whipped-ass victims.

249
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:58,216
That's fair.

250
00:12:58,251 --> 00:13:00,252
What's the plan?

251
00:13:00,286 --> 00:13:02,187
Outside, there's a boat down by the shore,

252
00:13:02,221 --> 00:13:04,923
big enough to carry the six
of us off of this island.

253
00:13:04,957 --> 00:13:06,424
A boat?

254
00:13:08,127 --> 00:13:09,694
You have a better idea?

255
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:11,796
I heard a chopper land the other day.

256
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:13,231
Thumped like a son of a bitch.

257
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:14,766
Why don't we fly out of here?

258
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,570
Do any of you know how to fly a helicopter?

259
00:13:22,475 --> 00:13:24,209
Mm-hmm. That's why.

260
00:13:24,243 --> 00:13:27,045
All right. This boat...

261
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:28,470
you got the keys to it?

262
00:13:29,135 --> 00:13:31,803
No. Not yet, but I will.

263
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:35,493
So are you in, or out?

264
00:13:38,624 --> 00:13:41,193
We're oh-for-three.
My dogs are barking.

265
00:13:41,227 --> 00:13:43,528
I'm hardly one to complain
about going to a bar,

266
00:13:43,563 --> 00:13:45,197
but this is getting ridiculous.

267
00:13:45,231 --> 00:13:47,199
It's grunt work, just like any other case.

268
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:49,801
Except it's not just like any other case;

269
00:13:49,836 --> 00:13:51,269
it's a hobby.

270
00:13:51,304 --> 00:13:53,305
Everybody needs a hobby.

271
00:13:55,341 --> 00:13:57,776
GCPD Homicide.

272
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,878
Yeah, she was in here.

273
00:13:59,912 --> 00:14:01,046
A while ago.

274
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,014
Maybe... three or four months?

275
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:05,150
You remember her.

276
00:14:05,184 --> 00:14:07,452
Yeah, she mentioned she went
to a rival college of mine.

277
00:14:07,487 --> 00:14:10,355
- Plus...
- Plus what?

278
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:12,224
To be honest with you, her date was hot.

279
00:14:12,258 --> 00:14:14,192
Her date?

280
00:14:14,227 --> 00:14:15,694
Remember what he looked like?

281
00:14:15,728 --> 00:14:18,563
Just that he was good-looking.

282
00:14:18,598 --> 00:14:20,632
But classy, you know?

283
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:25,937
Okay. Your turn.

284
00:14:25,972 --> 00:14:28,140
How is

285
00:14:28,174 --> 00:14:30,308
a successful, funny,

286
00:14:30,343 --> 00:14:33,779
mildly good-looking guy
like you still single?

287
00:14:33,813 --> 00:14:35,847
- "Mildly"?
- Maybe a little bit

288
00:14:35,882 --> 00:14:37,582
more than that. Come on.

289
00:14:37,617 --> 00:14:39,885
Something has to be wrong with you.

290
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:42,521
Maybe you're right. I've, uh...

291
00:14:42,555 --> 00:14:43,855
I've had plenty of relationships,

292
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,258
but in the end, they...

293
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:48,827
never seem to work out.

294
00:14:48,861 --> 00:14:50,896
Why not?

295
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,498
I think what I'm looking
for frightens people.

296
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:57,002
Uh... okay.

297
00:14:57,036 --> 00:14:58,904
No, it's...

298
00:14:58,938 --> 00:15:01,773
- It's nothing weird.
- What, then?

299
00:15:03,368 --> 00:15:05,077
It's gonna sound cheesy.

300
00:15:05,111 --> 00:15:08,947
I won't laugh. I promise.

301
00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:11,917
What I'm looking for...

302
00:15:11,951 --> 00:15:13,418
is unconditional love.

303
00:15:13,453 --> 00:15:15,687
Unconditional,

304
00:15:15,721 --> 00:15:20,225
real, intense love.

305
00:15:25,798 --> 00:15:27,232
Cheesy, right?

306
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:30,402
Totally.

307
00:15:40,913 --> 00:15:42,381
Wow.

308
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,785
- You like it?
- It'll do.

309
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:49,454
There's some wine in the kitchen.

310
00:15:49,489 --> 00:15:51,456
Open anything you like.

311
00:15:51,491 --> 00:15:52,791
May I take your jacket?

312
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:08,507
This place must work well.

313
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,976
What do you mean?

314
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,644
With the women that you bring back here.

315
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,180
Actually, it's...

316
00:16:15,214 --> 00:16:18,250
been a while since I've had anyone over.

317
00:16:18,284 --> 00:16:20,285
Hmm.

318
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:24,790
- Lucky me.
- I'm the lucky one.

319
00:16:24,824 --> 00:16:28,193
Thank you for taking a chance on me.

320
00:16:28,227 --> 00:16:29,995
Are you kidding me?

321
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:31,463
Look at this place.

322
00:16:31,497 --> 00:16:33,598
I could definitely stay here...

323
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:36,868
for a night.

324
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,342
Look, if he, uh, comes back in

325
00:16:44,377 --> 00:16:47,512
or you think of anything
else, give me a call.

326
00:16:47,547 --> 00:16:48,880
Sure.

327
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,652
He was right here, Harvey.

328
00:16:53,686 --> 00:16:55,487
Yeah.

329
00:16:55,521 --> 00:16:56,988
You're not dropping this one, are you?

330
00:16:58,524 --> 00:17:00,025
Not a chance.

331
00:17:23,246 --> 00:17:24,978
_

332
00:18:00,293 --> 00:18:01,961
So...

333
00:18:01,995 --> 00:18:03,662
are we in agreement?

334
00:18:03,697 --> 00:18:05,231
Not quite.

335
00:18:05,265 --> 00:18:07,066
Says he still loves the girl.

336
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,367
He won't leave her.

337
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:11,070
Antonia and I are destined to be together,

338
00:18:11,104 --> 00:18:13,606
and nothing you can do

339
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,441
will make me stop loving her.

340
00:18:15,475 --> 00:18:18,110
See what I mean? True love.

341
00:18:18,144 --> 00:18:19,378
You want me to put a slug in him,

342
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:20,646
see if that loosens him up?

343
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,182
No.

344
00:18:23,216 --> 00:18:24,550
He's a guitar player.

345
00:18:25,986 --> 00:18:27,353
Lose the fingers.

346
00:18:27,387 --> 00:18:28,888
You want me to shoot his fingers?

347
00:18:28,922 --> 00:18:30,623
Don't shoot them.

348
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,793
Lose them.

349
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,507
Just the man I wanted to see.

350
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:50,476
Oh, don't say that.

351
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,844
You're gonna make Jim jealous.

352
00:18:51,878 --> 00:18:54,346
I finished the Fairchild autopsy

353
00:18:54,381 --> 00:18:55,681
and the results were a little strange.

354
00:18:55,715 --> 00:18:56,849
Strange how?

355
00:18:56,883 --> 00:19:00,419
Grace Fairchild was missing
for over four months.

356
00:19:00,453 --> 00:19:01,887
Usually, with these kind of abductions,

357
00:19:01,922 --> 00:19:03,556
there's a lot of trauma
and abuse to the body,

358
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,857
but not this time.

359
00:19:04,891 --> 00:19:07,593
Other than the stab wounds
to her heart and her throat,

360
00:19:07,627 --> 00:19:09,195
her body was mostly pristine.

361
00:19:11,164 --> 00:19:12,731
That doesn't add up.

362
00:19:12,766 --> 00:19:14,066
Unless...

363
00:19:15,468 --> 00:19:16,702
Unless what?

364
00:19:16,736 --> 00:19:18,871
You ever consider she ran off on her own?

365
00:19:18,905 --> 00:19:20,673
That her going missing has nothing to do

366
00:19:20,707 --> 00:19:22,208
with her murder?

367
00:19:22,242 --> 00:19:24,844
The findings would certainly support that.

368
00:19:24,878 --> 00:19:26,478
Maybe.

369
00:19:30,383 --> 00:19:32,451
No.

370
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:34,620
No, Fairchild had a good job,

371
00:19:34,654 --> 00:19:35,955
a mortgage...

372
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:37,423
Hell, she called her mother

373
00:19:37,457 --> 00:19:39,091
the night she went missing.

374
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:42,361
No, she didn't run away. She was taken.

375
00:19:42,395 --> 00:19:46,765
And whoever took her kept her locked away

376
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,401
till he was good and ready...

377
00:19:49,436 --> 00:19:51,437
and then he killed her.

378
00:19:53,073 --> 00:19:54,573
I know it.

379
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:09,021
Morning.

380
00:20:09,055 --> 00:20:10,589
How'd you sleep?

381
00:20:10,624 --> 00:20:12,458
Like a baby.

382
00:20:16,363 --> 00:20:17,663
So I thought, after breakfast,

383
00:20:17,697 --> 00:20:19,732
we could go to the, uh, Palick exhibit.

384
00:20:19,766 --> 00:20:21,333
It's only in town another week.

385
00:20:21,368 --> 00:20:22,401
Oh...

386
00:20:22,435 --> 00:20:25,004
I would love to, really,
but I am already late,

387
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:27,173
and I've got a morning
meeting and a work lunch.

388
00:20:27,207 --> 00:20:29,608
- So reschedule it.
- I can't.

389
00:20:29,643 --> 00:20:32,478
I had a really good
time with you last night.

390
00:20:32,512 --> 00:20:34,980
And I hope that

391
00:20:35,015 --> 00:20:36,916
I get to see you again.

392
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,518
At least, uh... have some breakfast.

393
00:20:39,553 --> 00:20:41,687
Oh, I still have to go home and change

394
00:20:41,721 --> 00:20:42,988
and I am so late.

395
00:20:43,023 --> 00:20:44,156
Next time.

396
00:20:51,331 --> 00:20:53,399
Call me tonight.

397
00:20:53,433 --> 00:20:56,168
I can come over after work,

398
00:20:56,203 --> 00:20:59,038
if you want.

399
00:21:05,745 --> 00:21:07,913
Oh, Jason...

400
00:21:07,948 --> 00:21:09,548
please, I really have to go.

401
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,152
No.

402
00:21:14,821 --> 00:21:16,555
You don't.

403
00:22:25,892 --> 00:22:27,560
Miss Mooney.

404
00:22:31,431 --> 00:22:33,099
What a surprise.

405
00:22:41,949 --> 00:22:44,183
Is there something I can do for you?

406
00:22:44,218 --> 00:22:46,203
Well...

407
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:48,976
supplies were running low...

408
00:22:49,011 --> 00:22:50,645
for the inmates.

409
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:52,380
Those are in the storage room.

410
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:56,417
But then, of course, you already knew that.

411
00:22:58,087 --> 00:23:01,723
The one thing I won't tolerate...

412
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:03,424
is dishonesty.

413
00:23:06,528 --> 00:23:08,496
You were trying to escape, weren't you?

414
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,564
No.

415
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:12,900
I'll tell you what.

416
00:23:12,935 --> 00:23:14,902
I'm going to shoot you in the stomach.

417
00:23:14,937 --> 00:23:16,871
You'll feel pressure at first.

418
00:23:16,905 --> 00:23:19,107
Then you'll feel an intense burning

419
00:23:19,141 --> 00:23:21,109
like you've never felt in your life.

420
00:23:21,143 --> 00:23:23,111
Maybe that will properly motivate you

421
00:23:23,145 --> 00:23:24,946
to be honest with me.

422
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,281
I ask you again.

423
00:23:27,316 --> 00:23:29,450
Were you trying to escape?

424
00:23:32,221 --> 00:23:34,188
No.

425
00:23:34,223 --> 00:23:36,357
How disappointing.

426
00:23:36,392 --> 00:23:38,626
Wait, s-stop. Wait, wait.

427
00:23:38,661 --> 00:23:42,430
I was lying, but I... but
I wasn't trying to escape.

428
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,265
You were going to kill me?

429
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,933
Slit my throat, perhaps?

430
00:23:47,136 --> 00:23:49,103
No, I swear.

431
00:23:49,138 --> 00:23:51,105
Not yours...

432
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,141
Not yours.

433
00:23:56,512 --> 00:24:01,149
Every night when I close
my eyes, I pray to God

434
00:24:01,183 --> 00:24:05,153
that nightmare doesn't come.

435
00:24:05,187 --> 00:24:09,490
That... living, breathing man,

436
00:24:09,525 --> 00:24:14,095
stitched together with...
arms and legs that weren't his.

437
00:24:14,129 --> 00:24:17,665
That nightmare you created.

438
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,669
I've faced dangerous men,

439
00:24:21,704 --> 00:24:24,372
but none like you,

440
00:24:24,406 --> 00:24:27,075
Dollmaker.

441
00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:29,744
So you'd rather take your own life

442
00:24:29,778 --> 00:24:31,813
than end up one of my creations?

443
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:33,615
Yes.

444
00:24:36,485 --> 00:24:38,786
Well, Miss Mooney,

445
00:24:38,821 --> 00:24:41,456
try anything like this again,

446
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,958
and your nightmare will come true.

447
00:24:43,993 --> 00:24:46,794
I will bring you back from
the dead, if I have to...

448
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:51,799
and make you into something
the world has never seen.

449
00:24:58,172 --> 00:24:59,691
Was there something else?

450
00:25:02,845 --> 00:25:04,846
No.

451
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:27,368
Could've smashed your head
with a brick, you know?

452
00:25:27,403 --> 00:25:29,070
Why would you do that?

453
00:25:29,104 --> 00:25:31,072
Why'd you even say that?

454
00:25:31,106 --> 00:25:33,041
Just thought you should know. What's up?

455
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:35,043
Why're you looking for me?

456
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:37,045
Reggie Payne, the man who stabbed Alfred,

457
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,513
he's in Gotham.

458
00:25:38,547 --> 00:25:41,049
And you need my help to find him. Okay.

459
00:25:42,585 --> 00:25:45,219
Alfred said he'd be at a
gun range for a few days,

460
00:25:45,254 --> 00:25:46,888
but I checked every one in the city.

461
00:25:46,922 --> 00:25:48,523
Nothing.

462
00:25:48,557 --> 00:25:51,192
Who stays at a gun range for a few days?

463
00:25:51,226 --> 00:25:54,862
- Doesn't make any sense.
- That's what he said.

464
00:25:54,897 --> 00:25:56,864
Said Reggie'd be at a shooting gallery.

465
00:25:56,899 --> 00:26:00,101
That's not the same as a gun range, silly.

466
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,471
You really need to get out more.

467
00:26:12,381 --> 00:26:14,382
All right, all right, all right.

468
00:26:18,821 --> 00:26:20,655
Go get yourself cleaned up.

469
00:26:22,758 --> 00:26:24,425
Back in a minute.

470
00:26:32,635 --> 00:26:35,970
So shall we discuss terms?

471
00:26:39,775 --> 00:26:42,477
- So what is it?
- Well, to be clear,

472
00:26:42,511 --> 00:26:43,811
this isn't an actual piece
of crime scene evidence.

473
00:26:43,846 --> 00:26:45,246
It's long gone, as far as I can tell.

474
00:26:45,281 --> 00:26:47,582
What I was able to find is a photocopy,

475
00:26:47,616 --> 00:26:49,250
buried deep in a logbook.

476
00:26:49,285 --> 00:26:50,885
It's a broken heart.

477
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,487
Hand-painted, I'd guess.

478
00:26:55,858 --> 00:26:57,559
This was at the crime scene?

479
00:26:58,794 --> 00:27:00,261
You're sure?

480
00:27:00,296 --> 00:27:01,596
Well, not this, exactly.

481
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,498
You see, a photocopy is a replica...

482
00:27:03,532 --> 00:27:05,633
Damn it, no, Ed, not now.

483
00:27:05,668 --> 00:27:07,602
What's wrong? I warned you.

484
00:27:07,636 --> 00:27:11,105
But no, you had to go
and get both of us burned.

485
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,607
What are you talking about?

486
00:27:12,641 --> 00:27:15,810
This guy you're after,
this is not his first rodeo.

487
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:17,812
He's a serial killer.

488
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,984
This looks delicious.

489
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:24,419
Thank you.

490
00:27:25,788 --> 00:27:29,424
I, uh... I think I may have

491
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:32,293
overcooked the lamb... a little bit,

492
00:27:32,328 --> 00:27:33,962
but I-I, uh...

493
00:27:33,996 --> 00:27:35,330
I'm sure it's fine.

494
00:27:37,132 --> 00:27:38,433
How was your day?

495
00:27:38,467 --> 00:27:41,135
Wonderful, darling.

496
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,976
And how was yours?

497
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:51,679
Good.

498
00:27:51,714 --> 00:27:53,381
Thank you for asking.

499
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,153
Mmm.

500
00:28:13,936 --> 00:28:16,204
I think you might have been right...

501
00:28:16,238 --> 00:28:17,906
about the lamb.

502
00:28:19,742 --> 00:28:21,709
I'm so sorry.

503
00:28:21,744 --> 00:28:23,845
It's fine.

504
00:28:23,879 --> 00:28:25,947
I checked it twice when it was in the oven,

505
00:28:25,981 --> 00:28:28,483
and I think it might be
hotter than it says it is...

506
00:28:35,124 --> 00:28:37,759
You know...

507
00:28:40,462 --> 00:28:42,864
I don't think this is working out.

508
00:28:45,034 --> 00:28:47,035
It's not you.

509
00:28:50,372 --> 00:28:52,373
It's me.

510
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:10,925
Could have had something special.

511
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,261
Please. Please don't hurt me.

512
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:16,297
You know, I really
thought you were the one.

513
00:29:21,971 --> 00:29:23,938
Please.

514
00:29:23,973 --> 00:29:25,940
No, no.

515
00:29:25,975 --> 00:29:29,611
Don't worry. Sooner or
later, I'll find her.

516
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:42,843
I still don't get it.

517
00:29:42,877 --> 00:29:45,179
Why all that trouble
for this pile of bricks?

518
00:29:45,213 --> 00:29:47,514
This was never about money, Gabe.

519
00:29:47,549 --> 00:29:50,851
Not about money? What else is there?

520
00:29:50,885 --> 00:29:52,853
All kinds of things motivate people...

521
00:29:52,887 --> 00:29:56,523
Lust, ambition, envy.

522
00:29:56,558 --> 00:29:59,193
Okay, what motivated you?

523
00:29:59,227 --> 00:30:01,862
Why do you want this place so bad?

524
00:30:01,896 --> 00:30:03,230
It's simple.

525
00:30:05,567 --> 00:30:07,901
This is where I'm gonna kill Don Maroni.

526
00:30:17,379 --> 00:30:18,679
It's time.

527
00:30:18,713 --> 00:30:21,382
- Are you ready?
- Let's go.

528
00:30:35,263 --> 00:30:37,898
Now, as soon as this door
opens, an alarm will go off,

529
00:30:37,933 --> 00:30:39,567
and we will not have much time.

530
00:30:39,601 --> 00:30:41,902
- What about the gate?
- Unlocked last night.

531
00:30:41,937 --> 00:30:43,237
Take these.

532
00:30:43,271 --> 00:30:45,239
Get the boat started as
soon as you get there.

533
00:30:45,273 --> 00:30:46,774
You're not coming with us?

534
00:30:46,808 --> 00:30:49,310
I'm coming, I'll be right
back... I need to get Kelly.

535
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,245
He can barely walk. Let's go.

536
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,780
Call me sentimental,

537
00:30:52,814 --> 00:30:54,448
but I cannot leave him here.

538
00:30:58,286 --> 00:31:01,622
And you better not leave me.

539
00:31:27,983 --> 00:31:29,917
You lied to me, Fish.

540
00:31:33,221 --> 00:31:35,556
I warned you what would
happen if you lied to me.

541
00:31:37,225 --> 00:31:41,762
Oh, what wonders I'm
gonna make of your parts.

542
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:56,477
See you around, Doc.

543
00:31:56,511 --> 00:31:59,146
Leave him there. We don't have much time.

544
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,180
Let's go.

545
00:32:10,892 --> 00:32:12,192
This way.

546
00:32:12,227 --> 00:32:14,361
They're headed for the boat.

547
00:32:24,205 --> 00:32:26,006
What are you doing, man? Open up the gate.

548
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:28,142
I can't. It's locked.

549
00:32:28,176 --> 00:32:30,311
What? Fish said she unlocked it.

550
00:32:33,348 --> 00:32:36,016
- That bitch.
- What?

551
00:32:37,552 --> 00:32:39,186
Fish.

552
00:32:39,221 --> 00:32:41,188
She set us up.

553
00:32:53,802 --> 00:32:54,869
Kelly, other side!

554
00:32:58,907 --> 00:33:01,242
You told them you couldn't fly, didn't you?

555
00:33:01,276 --> 00:33:02,543
I lied.

556
00:33:20,495 --> 00:33:22,663
The chopper.

557
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,600
Hold on!

558
00:33:39,347 --> 00:33:41,315
- Aah!
- Fish!

559
00:34:01,819 --> 00:34:04,279
He abducts young, single, attractive women

560
00:34:04,305 --> 00:34:06,373
and he keeps them sometimes for a week,

561
00:34:06,408 --> 00:34:08,175
sometimes for months.

562
00:34:08,209 --> 00:34:10,978
Then he dumps their bodies around Gotham.

563
00:34:11,012 --> 00:34:14,248
- How many has he killed?
- A dozen, maybe more.

564
00:34:14,282 --> 00:34:15,649
Every time he makes a kill,

565
00:34:15,683 --> 00:34:17,651
he leaves one of these at the crime scene.

566
00:34:17,685 --> 00:34:18,919
It's his calling card.

567
00:34:18,953 --> 00:34:22,656
- So, who is he?
- No one knows.

568
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:25,292
Thinking is he's educated,
decent-looking, rich.

569
00:34:25,326 --> 00:34:27,294
But that's just a profile.

570
00:34:27,328 --> 00:34:29,430
Some of the guys call
him The Don Juan Killer.

571
00:34:29,464 --> 00:34:31,498
Most call him The Ogre.

572
00:34:31,533 --> 00:34:34,468
So, why haven't I heard
about this guy before?

573
00:34:34,502 --> 00:34:36,270
Why hasn't the public?

574
00:34:36,304 --> 00:34:38,105
- It's the GCPD's...
- Hey, fellas!

575
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:41,341
Dirty little secret.

576
00:34:41,376 --> 00:34:43,043
Only a handful of senior detectives

577
00:34:43,078 --> 00:34:44,511
know anything about this guy,

578
00:34:44,546 --> 00:34:46,347
and they sure as hell ain't
leaking it to the press.

579
00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:49,149
- Why not?
- Because The Ogre retaliates

580
00:34:49,184 --> 00:34:51,151
against any cop who investigates him.

581
00:34:51,186 --> 00:34:54,054
He kills the people they love.

582
00:34:54,089 --> 00:34:56,857
That's why this lunatic
hasn't been caught yet, Jim,

583
00:34:56,891 --> 00:34:59,827
because no one's been
stupid enough to investigate.

584
00:35:02,197 --> 00:35:03,897
Until I came along.

585
00:35:03,932 --> 00:35:06,533
Which makes me wonder
how did you catch this?

586
00:35:06,568 --> 00:35:09,203
I told you a fellow officer
asked me to look into it.

587
00:35:09,237 --> 00:35:11,905
Who? Which one?

588
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:35,929
Hey.

589
00:35:35,964 --> 00:35:37,965
That's him.

590
00:35:58,899 --> 00:36:02,122
Relax, old man. We're not gonna rob you.

591
00:36:02,157 --> 00:36:04,958
- What are you doing here?
- Came to talk to you.

592
00:36:04,993 --> 00:36:07,294
- Who's she?
- Never mind.

593
00:36:07,329 --> 00:36:10,831
- Who sent you to my house?
- Who sent me?

594
00:36:10,865 --> 00:36:14,201
Just go home... go on, Bruce.

595
00:36:14,235 --> 00:36:16,270
You'll be in more trouble
than you are already.

596
00:36:16,304 --> 00:36:19,340
Hey! That's my medicine! Give me that!

597
00:36:19,374 --> 00:36:21,942
My friend just asked you a question.

598
00:36:21,977 --> 00:36:25,946
- I said give me that.
- Or you'll what? Huh?

599
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:30,317
Hey!

600
00:36:30,352 --> 00:36:32,119
- Don't...
- Answer the question!

601
00:36:36,324 --> 00:36:38,993
I didn't mean any harm.

602
00:36:39,027 --> 00:36:42,296
I was just supposed to take some documents.

603
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:45,065
But Alfred walked in...

604
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,401
Is he all right?

605
00:36:49,204 --> 00:36:52,095
- Is he?
- You stabbed him.

606
00:36:53,642 --> 00:36:57,111
- What do you care?
- I care!

607
00:36:57,145 --> 00:36:58,545
He's all right, isn't he?

608
00:36:59,614 --> 00:37:01,515
Who sent you?

609
00:37:04,435 --> 00:37:06,720
Throw them out!

610
00:37:06,755 --> 00:37:09,023
- No!
- Tell me who sent you!

611
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:12,226
Who sent you?

612
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:15,763
You shouldn't be doing this, Bruce.

613
00:37:15,797 --> 00:37:19,433
Only Alfie can deal with these people.

614
00:37:19,467 --> 00:37:20,935
What people?

615
00:37:24,272 --> 00:37:26,340
There's a woman named Mathis

616
00:37:26,374 --> 00:37:29,176
and a guy called Bunderslaw.

617
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:32,112
Sid Bunderslaw... He's
the guy I dealt with.

618
00:37:32,147 --> 00:37:36,050
But you've got, you've got to
let Alfie take care of this.

619
00:37:36,084 --> 00:37:39,387
Not you, Bruce. It's
not business for a child.

620
00:37:39,487 --> 00:37:42,289
This man Bunderslaw...

621
00:37:42,324 --> 00:37:43,691
what did he want?

622
00:37:43,725 --> 00:37:46,193
Just to know what you knew.

623
00:37:46,227 --> 00:37:47,528
To see how far

624
00:37:47,562 --> 00:37:50,431
your investigation had gone.

625
00:37:50,465 --> 00:37:53,500
But he was scared.

626
00:37:53,535 --> 00:37:55,669
And that's why he sent me.

627
00:37:55,704 --> 00:37:58,238
Now, can I have my bag back, please?

628
00:37:58,273 --> 00:37:59,940
Please?

629
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:04,445
Give it back to him.

630
00:38:20,495 --> 00:38:21,662
You.

631
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:25,432
You're a sick man, Mr. Payne.

632
00:38:25,467 --> 00:38:27,101
You need help.

633
00:38:27,135 --> 00:38:30,604
Don't you patronize me.

634
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:33,207
I may have vices, yeah,

635
00:38:33,241 --> 00:38:35,242
but I'm a professional.

636
00:38:37,078 --> 00:38:40,247
You want me to tell Bunderslaw
that you're onto him?

637
00:38:40,282 --> 00:38:44,151
Because he'll come after you.

638
00:38:44,185 --> 00:38:46,654
And there's nothing that you can do

639
00:38:46,688 --> 00:38:48,322
to stop him!

640
00:38:48,356 --> 00:38:51,325
You're just silly

641
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,360
little children.

642
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:58,132
I'm gonna tell on you.

643
00:39:15,884 --> 00:39:17,651
No, you won't!

644
00:39:45,881 --> 00:39:47,615
It wa... it wa... it wasn't my idea!

645
00:39:47,649 --> 00:39:49,216
I swear!

646
00:39:49,251 --> 00:39:51,018
I-I was ordered to get
you to take the case.

647
00:39:51,052 --> 00:39:54,388
- Ordered by who?!
- Loeb!

648
00:39:54,422 --> 00:39:56,423
It was Commissioner Loeb.

649
00:40:01,229 --> 00:40:03,430
He told me to tell you that...

650
00:40:03,465 --> 00:40:05,666
I looked up to you.

651
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,701
That you inspired me.

652
00:40:07,736 --> 00:40:09,136
I mean, he-he told me to say

653
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:11,705
that I wanted to help clean up Gotham.

654
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:14,975
And, uh, the GCPD. And that this case...

655
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:18,112
this case was part of that.

656
00:40:18,146 --> 00:40:20,848
He knew you couldn't say no.

657
00:40:22,284 --> 00:40:25,419
And so you followed
orders like a good soldier.

658
00:40:25,453 --> 00:40:28,122
I-I didn't have a choice.

659
00:40:28,156 --> 00:40:31,292
You know what Loeb can do.

660
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,931
All too well.

661
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:40,868
Jim, listen! You're still
in the clear on this.

662
00:40:40,902 --> 00:40:42,703
"In the clear"? He could come after Lee!

663
00:40:42,737 --> 00:40:45,206
Only if he thinks you're investigating him.

664
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,273
Think about it.

665
00:40:46,308 --> 00:40:48,576
It's not on your docket.

666
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,044
There's been no press
linking you up to this case.

667
00:40:50,078 --> 00:40:51,378
Hell, all you've done is ask some questions

668
00:40:51,413 --> 00:40:52,980
so you got to drop it now!

669
00:40:53,014 --> 00:40:55,316
This is no time to be a hero.

670
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,251
If I drop it, I'm letting
a serial killer go free.

671
00:40:57,285 --> 00:40:59,453
The blood of his next
victim is on my hands!

672
00:40:59,487 --> 00:41:01,255
If you don't drop it,
that blood could be Lee's.

673
00:41:04,326 --> 00:41:05,860
Hi, you've reached Lee.

674
00:41:05,894 --> 00:41:07,161
Go ahead and leave a message.

675
00:41:08,263 --> 00:41:12,066
Lee, call me as soon as
you can. It's very import...

676
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:20,774
You! You son of a bitch!

677
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:22,822
- Excuse me!
- You set me up!

678
00:41:22,884 --> 00:41:24,084
Detective, I don't know what you think...

679
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:25,219
Don't talk. Listen.

680
00:41:25,253 --> 00:41:27,121
- Hey!
- Back off!

681
00:41:27,155 --> 00:41:29,423
Don't you...

682
00:41:29,457 --> 00:41:31,892
I tried to work with you.

683
00:41:31,926 --> 00:41:35,195
But now you crossed a line.

684
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:39,133
You come after the one I love.

685
00:41:39,167 --> 00:41:41,468
From here on, we're playing my way.

686
00:41:41,503 --> 00:41:44,305
No more games. No more deals.

687
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:47,041
I'm gonna find The Ogre and
I'm gonna put him behind bars.

688
00:41:47,075 --> 00:41:49,777
And when I've done that,
I'm coming after you.

689
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:51,745
I'm coming after you,

690
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,047
Commissioner.

691
00:41:53,081 --> 00:41:55,082
You're done.

692
00:42:01,551 --> 00:42:06,584
