1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:02,453
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:02,516 --> 00:00:04,281
This is Reginald Payne.

3
00:00:04,297 --> 00:00:05,864
- We served together, sir.
- Please feel free

4
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:07,132
to stay with us a few days.

5
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:08,967
You're stealing from us?

6
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:16,041
Arnold Flass, you're under arrest
for the murder of Leon Winkler.

7
00:00:16,075 --> 00:00:18,444
I.A. ruled it a suicide.

8
00:00:18,478 --> 00:00:19,745
Arnold Flass, you're under arrest.

9
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:21,413
I'm protected.

10
00:00:21,448 --> 00:00:24,249
So you're the one
causing all of the fuss.

11
00:00:24,284 --> 00:00:25,918
You will take

12
00:00:25,952 --> 00:00:28,620
- nothing from me.
- Really?

13
00:00:30,056 --> 00:00:32,224
No!

14
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,224
He has nothing concrete.

15
00:00:35,258 --> 00:00:38,093
Now's the time to make a move on the kid.

16
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,071
Slim pickings at the food court.

17
00:00:49,105 --> 00:00:51,707
- Brought you a bagel.
- Thanks.

18
00:00:51,741 --> 00:00:54,209
Nothing for the invalid?

19
00:00:54,244 --> 00:00:56,745
Sorry. Hospital food only.

20
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,148
- Doctor's orders. How you feeling?
- All right.

21
00:00:59,182 --> 00:01:01,150
Had a slight... puncture.

22
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:03,052
Leaked a bit.

23
00:01:03,086 --> 00:01:04,820
So I know last night
must be kind of a blur,

24
00:01:04,854 --> 00:01:06,388
but do you have any idea who did this?

25
00:01:06,423 --> 00:01:07,690
It-it was...

26
00:01:07,724 --> 00:01:08,824
It was dark. It was very dark.

27
00:01:08,858 --> 00:01:10,993
Saw a...

28
00:01:11,027 --> 00:01:14,363
shadow and... my savior Master Bruce

29
00:01:14,397 --> 00:01:16,365
was leaning over me.

30
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:17,900
Did you get a look at the guy?

31
00:01:17,934 --> 00:01:19,568
No.

32
00:01:21,905 --> 00:01:25,341
Sorry. My captain keeps calling.

33
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:26,875
It's fine, Detective.

34
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,178
- Just-just go.
- No, I can stay.

35
00:01:29,212 --> 00:01:31,247
I really appreciate you
sitting with Master Bruce,

36
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:34,016
but as you can see, I'm completely fine.

37
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,018
Go.

38
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:37,786
All right.

39
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:39,955
I'll try and stop by later.

40
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,391
Thank you again for coming, Detective.

41
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:51,734
Why not tell him the truth?

42
00:01:51,768 --> 00:01:53,969
Well, believe it or not,

43
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:55,304
Master Bruce, Reggie's a mate,

44
00:01:55,338 --> 00:01:57,273
and you don't set coppers
on your mates, do you?

45
00:01:57,307 --> 00:01:59,008
But he nearly killed you.

46
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:00,476
I served with that bastard.

47
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,645
Anyone sorts him out,
it's me... Nobody else.

48
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:03,946
It wouldn't be right.

49
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,948
Why would he stab you?

50
00:02:05,982 --> 00:02:08,217
That's a bloody good question.

51
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:10,619
And one...

52
00:02:10,654 --> 00:02:12,588
I mean to find out.

53
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,429
'Cause longer that bloody
lunatic's out on the loose...

54
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:24,099
the harder it's gonna be to find him.

55
00:02:24,134 --> 00:02:25,601
Now, you just...

56
00:02:27,203 --> 00:02:29,238
G-Get back in bed, Alfred.

57
00:02:29,272 --> 00:02:32,708
- Just pass me my robe.
- Get back in bed!

58
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:37,313
That's an order.

59
00:02:48,525 --> 00:02:51,160
Ah.

60
00:02:51,194 --> 00:02:53,429
You're awake.

61
00:02:53,463 --> 00:02:55,631
Wonderful.

62
00:02:55,665 --> 00:02:57,566
How long have I been...

63
00:02:57,601 --> 00:03:00,669
Asleep? Just since last night.

64
00:03:00,704 --> 00:03:03,272
How do you feel?

65
00:03:03,306 --> 00:03:06,675
- My head hurts.
- To be expected.

66
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,345
May I?

67
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:12,114
Who are you?

68
00:03:12,148 --> 00:03:14,850
Dr. Francis Dulmacher.

69
00:03:14,885 --> 00:03:17,353
Founder of this facility.

70
00:03:17,387 --> 00:03:19,688
A pleasure.

71
00:03:21,124 --> 00:03:23,859
I've gone to great lengths
to meet you, Doctor.

72
00:03:23,894 --> 00:03:25,628
Indeed you have.

73
00:03:25,662 --> 00:03:29,365
I must say you have a
remarkable constitution.

74
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:32,368
I wish I could say the
same of all my patients.

75
00:03:32,402 --> 00:03:36,138
Oh. So I'm a patient
now? No longer a prisoner?

76
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:38,574
I confess I don't know what you are.

77
00:03:38,608 --> 00:03:41,210
You seize control of the basement,

78
00:03:41,244 --> 00:03:43,812
take one of my guards hostage,

79
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:47,283
then scoop out your own eye.

80
00:03:47,317 --> 00:03:49,185
What am I to do with you?

81
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:52,454
Simple. Make me your right hand.

82
00:03:53,957 --> 00:03:56,325
I'm glad to see you've
retained your sense of humor.

83
00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:58,327
I'm not joking.

84
00:03:58,361 --> 00:04:02,164
For the past ten years,
I've been Carmine Falcone's

85
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,532
top lieutenant.

86
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:05,468
I'm afraid the name means nothing to me.

87
00:04:07,504 --> 00:04:11,240
I woke up hungry and alone
in an underground cell.

88
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:15,211
In less than a week, I brought
this place to a standstill.

89
00:04:15,245 --> 00:04:17,213
Now, you've had me as your enemy.

90
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:20,015
Wouldn't you rather have me as your friend?

91
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,051
Such vim.

92
00:04:22,085 --> 00:04:24,620
Such... panache.

93
00:04:24,654 --> 00:04:26,889
Bravo.

94
00:04:26,923 --> 00:04:29,258
And now you should eat.

95
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:31,227
I'll have a nurse come in with some food.

96
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:33,362
We'll talk more later.

97
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:35,865
Tricky things, eyes.

98
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:38,868
Our stock is frightfully low at the moment.

99
00:04:38,902 --> 00:04:40,536
Oh, and apologies.

100
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,106
We couldn't match your original color.

101
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:46,142
We'll talk soon.

102
00:05:21,945 --> 00:05:23,412
This can't be true.

103
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:24,980
I was prepping the case for the D.A.

104
00:05:25,015 --> 00:05:26,649
when word came down this morning.

105
00:05:26,683 --> 00:05:28,484
Press got it last night, of course.

106
00:05:28,518 --> 00:05:30,653
We had the murder weapon.

107
00:05:30,687 --> 00:05:32,188
With Flass's prints.

108
00:05:32,222 --> 00:05:33,322
There's no way.

109
00:05:33,356 --> 00:05:34,990
Apparently, the defense dug up a witness,

110
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:36,859
cleared Flass of all charges.

111
00:05:36,893 --> 00:05:38,627
- What witness?
- No idea.

112
00:05:38,662 --> 00:05:40,329
Only the judge and the
lead attorneys were privy,

113
00:05:40,364 --> 00:05:43,466
and our honorable D.A. is staying mum.

114
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,867
What about a subpoena?

115
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:46,202
We don't have sufficient grounds.

116
00:05:46,236 --> 00:05:48,471
But I did a little snooping around.

117
00:05:48,505 --> 00:05:50,172
- And?
- The mystery witness

118
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,575
was provided by Commissioner Loeb.

119
00:05:54,578 --> 00:05:56,779
Let me guess.

120
00:05:56,813 --> 00:05:59,115
Loeb's reinstating Flass as head of Narco.

121
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:00,349
Worse.

122
00:06:00,384 --> 00:06:02,351
He announced he's backing
Flass for president

123
00:06:02,386 --> 00:06:04,987
of the policemen's union
in the upcoming election.

124
00:06:05,022 --> 00:06:07,223
So you're telling me a man
we know is a drug dealer

125
00:06:07,257 --> 00:06:09,392
and a murderer is gonna potentially hold

126
00:06:09,426 --> 00:06:10,860
a major position in the GCPD?

127
00:06:10,894 --> 00:06:12,828
Clearly, Loeb's sending a message.

128
00:06:12,863 --> 00:06:15,031
This is not gonna stand.

129
00:06:15,065 --> 00:06:16,832
Look, I'm just as upset
about this as you are, Jim,

130
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:18,134
but it's the commissioner.

131
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:21,037
Which is what makes it worse.

132
00:06:21,071 --> 00:06:23,572
Jim! Jim!

133
00:06:29,913 --> 00:06:31,580
Jimbo.

134
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:34,383
You heard the good news?

135
00:06:34,418 --> 00:06:37,386
Hey, the boys are throwing me a
welcome back down at O'Donnelys.

136
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:39,889
Figure you want to stop by.

137
00:06:39,923 --> 00:06:43,592
Show support for your
soon-to-be new president.

138
00:06:43,627 --> 00:06:45,561
I wouldn't celebrate just yet.

139
00:06:45,595 --> 00:06:47,930
You just don't learn.

140
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:50,866
Still want to take me down.

141
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:53,603
I'm like the phoenix.

142
00:06:53,637 --> 00:06:55,004
I'll just rise

143
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:59,208
again and again and again.

144
00:07:05,282 --> 00:07:06,716
Ah, Detective Gordon.

145
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,386
I had a presentiment I might be seeing you.

146
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,455
Arnold Flass is a murderer.

147
00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:13,756
He belongs in jail.

148
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,925
Detective Flass was legally exonerated.

149
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:19,729
The judge heard testimony.
The case is closed.

150
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:25,034
You used your connections
to orchestrate his release.

151
00:07:25,068 --> 00:07:27,403
You perverted the system.

152
00:07:27,437 --> 00:07:30,139
Petulance and naiveté
are a bad combination.

153
00:07:30,173 --> 00:07:32,775
Know when you're beaten.

154
00:07:32,809 --> 00:07:35,778
I was knee-deep in the
Flass investigation.

155
00:07:35,812 --> 00:07:37,947
There is no one with enough credibility

156
00:07:37,981 --> 00:07:40,750
to trump our evidence.

157
00:07:40,784 --> 00:07:43,920
I do enjoy when unwavering certainty

158
00:07:43,954 --> 00:07:46,923
is undermined by the truth.

159
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,493
Look into the camera, state your name

160
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,794
and why you're here.

161
00:07:51,828 --> 00:07:54,564
My name is
Detective Harvey Bullock,

162
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:57,333
and I presented false
evidence against my fellow

163
00:07:57,367 --> 00:08:00,369
GCPD detective, Arnold Flass.

164
00:08:09,413 --> 00:08:11,400
Hey, there you are. Aw, dude.

165
00:08:11,438 --> 00:08:13,906
Feel like a herd of cattle had a
dance party in my head last night.

166
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,141
What's up?

167
00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:17,491
Why the hell would you
lie to exonerate Flass?

168
00:08:19,704 --> 00:08:21,871
Don't deny it. I saw the tape.

169
00:08:21,906 --> 00:08:23,640
I'm not denying anything.

170
00:08:23,674 --> 00:08:25,875
I did what I had to do.

171
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:29,579
If I didn't do what Loeb told
me to do, I would've lost my job.

172
00:08:29,614 --> 00:08:31,548
Probably gone to prison.

173
00:08:31,582 --> 00:08:33,850
What does he have on you?

174
00:08:33,884 --> 00:08:35,318
Harvey.

175
00:08:35,353 --> 00:08:37,420
Do you honestly think you're
the only one who had the orders

176
00:08:37,455 --> 00:08:39,356
to take a punk down to the end of a pier

177
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,925
and put a bullet in his head? Huh?

178
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:47,264
The difference is my
Cobblepot didn't come back.

179
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:51,434
Who'd you kill?

180
00:08:51,469 --> 00:08:53,570
Some scumbag mobster.

181
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:55,605
Caught him coming out of a club one night.

182
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,375
My sergeant put a gun in my
hand, held another to my head,

183
00:08:58,409 --> 00:09:00,043
and said, "Make a choice."

184
00:09:00,077 --> 00:09:02,612
I decided to keep breathing.

185
00:09:02,647 --> 00:09:04,714
Damn it, Harvey.

186
00:09:04,749 --> 00:09:06,216
So what?

187
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,218
What are you gonna do? Arrest
me? Go ahead. Arrest me.

188
00:09:08,252 --> 00:09:09,686
But don't stop there.

189
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,688
Half the cops in the GCPD have a Cobblepot,

190
00:09:11,722 --> 00:09:14,758
and Loeb has the goods on all of them.

191
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:16,293
That is what Loeb does.

192
00:09:16,327 --> 00:09:18,728
Well, it ends now.

193
00:09:18,763 --> 00:09:20,697
Jim, hey.

194
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:22,933
Going after Flass was bad enough.

195
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:25,502
Going after Loeb is
suicide, plain and simple.

196
00:09:25,536 --> 00:09:26,703
So what?

197
00:09:26,737 --> 00:09:27,804
Am I supposed to stay quiet?

198
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:29,239
Fall in line like the rest of you?

199
00:09:29,273 --> 00:09:31,474
That would be a good idea.

200
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:34,945
Day I do that is the
day I quit being a cop.

201
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,258
Oh, my.

202
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:49,993
Fun fact.

203
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:52,395
The human species attracts
members of the opposite sex

204
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,630
via pheromones

205
00:09:53,664 --> 00:09:55,465
secreted through saliva, sweat and urine.

206
00:09:55,499 --> 00:09:56,933
Gross.

207
00:09:56,968 --> 00:10:00,437
But... one can't always trust
such an animalistic method

208
00:10:00,471 --> 00:10:02,272
to find a suitable partner.

209
00:10:02,306 --> 00:10:04,241
What are you trying to tell me?

210
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:06,676
Arnold Flass was released.

211
00:10:06,711 --> 00:10:08,645
I know that you two were dating,

212
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,413
and if the attraction
wasn't intellectual...

213
00:10:10,448 --> 00:10:11,982
How could it be with that gorilla?...

214
00:10:12,016 --> 00:10:13,683
Then it must be physical.

215
00:10:13,718 --> 00:10:17,254
He's just... he's such a bad,

216
00:10:17,288 --> 00:10:19,823
- bad, bad...
- I appreciate your concern.

217
00:10:19,857 --> 00:10:21,658
But it won't be necessary.

218
00:10:21,692 --> 00:10:25,862
I've realized there are
far better men in the world

219
00:10:25,896 --> 00:10:27,397
than Arnold Flass.

220
00:10:35,806 --> 00:10:39,509
So Loeb's been collecting
dirt on cops for years

221
00:10:39,543 --> 00:10:41,711
and using it to
control the department.

222
00:10:41,746 --> 00:10:43,546
I doubt it stops there.

223
00:10:43,581 --> 00:10:48,051
He's probably got leverage
on businessmen, politicians.

224
00:10:48,085 --> 00:10:51,388
He's got nothing on me.

225
00:10:51,422 --> 00:10:53,023
Just checking.

226
00:10:53,057 --> 00:10:56,359
Anyway, yeah, that's the
source of all his power.

227
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:59,462
And you want to steal the dragon's gold.

228
00:10:59,497 --> 00:11:02,165
If we find his cache of
evidence and destroy it,

229
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:03,967
he'll be toothless.

230
00:11:04,001 --> 00:11:06,870
Oh, I know Loeb.

231
00:11:06,904 --> 00:11:09,306
He won't keep it anywhere obvious.

232
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,007
We could watch him, hope he leads us to it.

233
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:12,409
We don't have that kind of time.

234
00:11:12,443 --> 00:11:15,210
Isn't there someone
Loeb might have trusted?

235
00:11:16,714 --> 00:11:19,482
Ex-friends? An estranged wife?

236
00:11:19,517 --> 00:11:21,484
Well, he was married.

237
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,887
She died 20 years ago.

238
00:11:23,921 --> 00:11:25,689
Fell down the stairs.

239
00:11:25,723 --> 00:11:27,591
Well, there were rumors Loeb killed her,

240
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,694
but nothing ever happened with it.

241
00:11:30,728 --> 00:11:33,430
Still can't believe about your partner.

242
00:11:33,464 --> 00:11:36,333
Why'd he do it? What's Loeb have on him?

243
00:11:36,367 --> 00:11:39,703
I don't know.

244
00:11:39,737 --> 00:11:41,338
Well, it's got to be rough.

245
00:11:41,372 --> 00:11:44,374
I know how it is with
cops and their partners.

246
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:49,746
What is it?

247
00:11:53,618 --> 00:11:55,085
What's the matter, Dent?

248
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:57,020
I thought that Lambusta case was settled.

249
00:11:57,054 --> 00:11:59,022
And why the hell are we meeting here?

250
00:11:59,056 --> 00:12:00,757
You'll see.

251
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,192
You know Jim Gordon?

252
00:12:02,226 --> 00:12:04,561
What the hell's going on?

253
00:12:04,595 --> 00:12:06,630
Have a seat.

254
00:12:08,132 --> 00:12:11,368
Back before Loeb was commissioner,

255
00:12:11,402 --> 00:12:15,305
when he was a lowly homicide
dick, you were his partner.

256
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:17,941
Yeah? That was 20 years ago.

257
00:12:17,975 --> 00:12:20,910
But I always hear that cop
partnerships are like marriages.

258
00:12:20,945 --> 00:12:23,446
You know each other better than your wives.

259
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:25,148
Isn't that right, Jim?

260
00:12:25,182 --> 00:12:27,384
That's right.

261
00:12:27,418 --> 00:12:30,387
You digging up that old story
about Loeb killing his wife?

262
00:12:30,421 --> 00:12:32,589
He was with me when she died.

263
00:12:32,623 --> 00:12:35,792
We know about the secret files.

264
00:12:35,826 --> 00:12:37,227
What secret files?

265
00:12:37,261 --> 00:12:38,561
Oh, that was good.

266
00:12:38,596 --> 00:12:40,297
I almost believed him.

267
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:42,799
- What about you, Jim?
- No.

268
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,502
You're out of your depth, kid. Both of you.

269
00:12:45,536 --> 00:12:48,171
Swim back to shore.

270
00:12:50,308 --> 00:12:52,676
He's got something on you, too, doesn't he?

271
00:12:57,014 --> 00:12:59,316
He got you to do something for him.

272
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,583
What was it?

273
00:13:00,618 --> 00:13:04,087
Robbery? Coercion?

274
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:07,524
Murder?

275
00:13:07,558 --> 00:13:09,659
And all this time, he's been using it

276
00:13:09,694 --> 00:13:12,662
to keep you under his thumb.

277
00:13:12,697 --> 00:13:16,132
This is your chance to breathe easy again.

278
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:19,169
Take it, Griggs.

279
00:13:19,203 --> 00:13:22,539
I don't know what you
two are talking about.

280
00:13:22,573 --> 00:13:25,141
If I did, I'd say talk to Xi Lu.

281
00:13:25,176 --> 00:13:27,421
Chinese bookkeeper on Huron Street.

282
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:31,281
Loeb always said you want
to keep something safe,

283
00:13:31,315 --> 00:13:34,384
you give it to Xi Lu.

284
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:40,390
You want to bring in Bullock?

285
00:13:40,424 --> 00:13:42,626
We might need him.

286
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,160
No.

287
00:13:46,597 --> 00:13:48,098
Thanks, Joe.

288
00:13:52,937 --> 00:13:54,537
I mean it.

289
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:56,239
I like the blue.

290
00:13:56,274 --> 00:13:57,741
I'm so pleased.

291
00:13:57,775 --> 00:14:00,043
Happy patient, happy doctor.

292
00:14:00,077 --> 00:14:02,646
Ah. Mrs. Harris.

293
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,314
Hello, Doctor.

294
00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:07,017
Don't forget... jazz
at 6:00 on the veranda,

295
00:14:07,051 --> 00:14:09,085
but no martinis until the
bandages come off, yes?

296
00:14:10,688 --> 00:14:13,023
Good girl.

297
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,228
Kidney transplant.

298
00:14:18,262 --> 00:14:21,698
We threw in a new face for
free, and none too soon.

299
00:14:21,732 --> 00:14:23,533
But you need a steady supply of organs.

300
00:14:23,568 --> 00:14:24,868
Yes.

301
00:14:24,902 --> 00:14:27,110
Which is suddenly something
of a problem, thanks to you.

302
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,406
But I'm also a solution.

303
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,608
The people in the basement trust me.

304
00:14:31,642 --> 00:14:33,577
Put me in charge,

305
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:37,280
and I promise you a dependable
flow of healthy product.

306
00:14:37,315 --> 00:14:39,549
Or I could save myself the trouble

307
00:14:39,584 --> 00:14:41,351
and kill you and everyone downstairs.

308
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,389
Now, if that were an option,
you would have done it already,

309
00:14:46,424 --> 00:14:49,092
and you surely wouldn't have
wasted this beautiful eye

310
00:14:49,126 --> 00:14:50,894
on little old me.

311
00:14:50,928 --> 00:14:53,897
I'd like to show you something.

312
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:59,269
People view themselves as
unique, self-contained systems,

313
00:14:59,303 --> 00:15:02,405
but we are merely a collection of parts.

314
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,141
What happens when I replace your eyes,

315
00:15:05,176 --> 00:15:07,444
your face, your heart?

316
00:15:07,478 --> 00:15:10,780
When do you stop being you
and become something new?

317
00:15:10,815 --> 00:15:13,116
That's what fascinates me.

318
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,552
Nice talk.

319
00:15:15,586 --> 00:15:18,054
Do we have a deal?

320
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,725
Conditionally.

321
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:23,627
I will send you back to the basement,

322
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:25,996
you will retrieve my
guard, and then prove to me

323
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,632
that you can provide me with the bodies.

324
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,267
A test.

325
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,438
And if I fail?

326
00:15:35,473 --> 00:15:39,609
Oh, those who fail me
still have their uses.

327
00:15:41,646 --> 00:15:44,648
You may remember my former office manager.

328
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:10,640
Amusing, no?

329
00:16:19,634 --> 00:16:21,134
"And then I
looked at the stars,

330
00:16:21,171 --> 00:16:23,573
"and considered how awful
it would be for a man

331
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,509
"to turn his face up to
them as he froze to death,

332
00:16:26,543 --> 00:16:29,312
and see no help or pity in
the glittering multitude... "

333
00:16:31,982 --> 00:16:34,116
That's cheerful.

334
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:37,482
What are you doing here?

335
00:16:37,517 --> 00:16:39,484
Ivy sneaks in a few times a week.

336
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,887
Steals food from the sickies.

337
00:16:41,921 --> 00:16:43,989
She spotted you.

338
00:16:45,024 --> 00:16:46,958
He okay?

339
00:16:54,634 --> 00:16:56,635
I'm sorry.

340
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,376
Thanks.

341
00:17:06,774 --> 00:17:09,109
Alfred was stabbed.

342
00:17:09,143 --> 00:17:11,912
It was a friend of his from the army.

343
00:17:11,946 --> 00:17:14,915
Wow. That sucks.

344
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:17,851
I think he was there because of me.

345
00:17:17,885 --> 00:17:19,119
What are you talking about?

346
00:17:19,153 --> 00:17:20,387
I had a meeting with the board

347
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:22,923
of Wayne Enterprises to tell them I was

348
00:17:22,957 --> 00:17:25,058
investigating them, so they sent someone

349
00:17:25,092 --> 00:17:27,193
we'd trust to spy on us.
What was he looking for?

350
00:17:27,228 --> 00:17:28,595
Some of my files were missing.

351
00:17:28,629 --> 00:17:30,196
I think the other things he stole

352
00:17:30,231 --> 00:17:32,265
were just cover.

353
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,236
If I find him, I could
find out who hired him.

354
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,205
He's-he's the key to everything.

355
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:41,107
You're gonna track him down? Really? You?

356
00:17:41,142 --> 00:17:43,743
I-I have to.

357
00:17:43,778 --> 00:17:46,112
This... this is my fault.

358
00:17:46,147 --> 00:17:47,547
Kid, you're out of your mind.

359
00:17:47,582 --> 00:17:50,116
Look at him. Is that
how you want to end up?

360
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:56,122
I don't expect you to understand.

361
00:17:56,157 --> 00:17:58,058
- I'll help.
- No.

362
00:17:58,092 --> 00:18:01,328
I can't risk anybody else
getting hurt on account of me.

363
00:18:01,362 --> 00:18:03,263
You know how to find me.

364
00:18:38,966 --> 00:18:40,400
Xi Lu?

365
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:57,451
Detective Gordon, GCPD.

366
00:18:57,485 --> 00:19:00,020
We have a few questions
we'd like to ask you.

367
00:19:00,054 --> 00:19:01,988
Is there somewhere we can talk in private?

368
00:19:03,991 --> 00:19:06,059
Ask your questions, Detective.

369
00:19:06,093 --> 00:19:09,529
It's about Commissioner Loeb.

370
00:19:09,564 --> 00:19:12,732
We understand you two have
a business relationship?

371
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,836
I do not know Commissioner Loeb.

372
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,839
Listen, old man, we can have a dozen ADAs

373
00:19:18,873 --> 00:19:20,574
and cops here in ten minutes.

374
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:23,143
They'll confiscate every
dollar in this place,

375
00:19:23,177 --> 00:19:24,644
and you will go to jail.

376
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,587
Hmm.

377
00:19:42,363 --> 00:19:44,731
Your name is Gordon.

378
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:49,002
- That's right.
- And you are Dent.

379
00:19:49,036 --> 00:19:50,771
Yes.

380
00:19:50,805 --> 00:19:52,806
Wait here.

381
00:19:58,573 --> 00:19:59,707
Okay. Not good.

382
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,075
GCPD!

383
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:02,376
Drop your weapons now!

384
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,778
- Gordon...
- Yeah, run!

385
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:40,514
Get in!

386
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:05,072
We got to go back there.
You've got to call backup.

387
00:21:05,106 --> 00:21:06,982
Forget it! The place will be
cleaned out in five minutes.

388
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:09,543
- Thanks for stopping by.
- I got enough on my conscience.

389
00:21:09,578 --> 00:21:10,878
Griggs set us up.

390
00:21:10,912 --> 00:21:12,980
Now Loeb knows we're
after his evidence cache.

391
00:21:13,014 --> 00:21:16,317
Griggs sent you? Guy would turn
on anyone to save his own skin.

392
00:21:16,351 --> 00:21:17,651
You just got to scare him enough.

393
00:21:17,686 --> 00:21:19,386
- We tried.
- Let me.

394
00:21:19,421 --> 00:21:22,756
Counselor, trust me, you're
gonna want to sit this one out.

395
00:21:25,794 --> 00:21:27,228
I want a name!

396
00:21:27,262 --> 00:21:29,897
- Falcone!
- What?!

397
00:21:29,931 --> 00:21:32,133
The only person who knows
where Loeb keeps his stash!

398
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,568
Falcone!

399
00:21:34,603 --> 00:21:36,604
The two of them are in it together!

400
00:21:36,638 --> 00:21:39,740
Loeb and Falcone!

401
00:21:40,776 --> 00:21:43,077
You two are dead men!

402
00:21:43,111 --> 00:21:45,246
You're going against Loeb
and Falcone? You're dead!

403
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,927
Go! Before I lose my good cheer. Go!

404
00:21:49,384 --> 00:21:52,353
He has a point.

405
00:21:52,387 --> 00:21:55,089
Yeah.

406
00:21:55,123 --> 00:21:56,824
So what next?

407
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,995
Assume Loeb and Falcone are the only ones

408
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:02,963
who know where the stash is.

409
00:22:02,998 --> 00:22:06,227
We need someone close to
them, someone who'll talk.

410
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:09,103
That person doesn't exist.

411
00:22:09,137 --> 00:22:11,138
Yeah, he does.

412
00:22:14,075 --> 00:22:16,710
Oh, yes.

413
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:24,785
Gentlemen.

414
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,087
So nice to see you.

415
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:31,158
What can I do for you?

416
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:37,823
You do realize what you're asking me to do?

417
00:22:38,535 --> 00:22:40,035
If Don Falcone is working with

418
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:43,105
Commissioner Loeb to keep
this trove of secrets hidden

419
00:22:43,139 --> 00:22:45,908
and I help you uncover them,

420
00:22:45,942 --> 00:22:47,776
I'd be betraying my patron.

421
00:22:47,811 --> 00:22:50,045
- That's right.
- If he found out, he'd...

422
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,249
well, he'd be very angry.

423
00:22:53,283 --> 00:22:54,416
To say the least.

424
00:22:54,451 --> 00:22:56,252
Enough with
the hemming and hawing.

425
00:22:56,286 --> 00:22:58,087
Are you gonna help us or not?

426
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,858
Let say, for argument's
sake, I could help you.

427
00:23:02,892 --> 00:23:04,527
What's in it for me?

428
00:23:04,561 --> 00:23:07,730
I'll owe you a favor.

429
00:23:07,764 --> 00:23:09,765
No questions asked?

430
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:12,101
Jim.

431
00:23:12,135 --> 00:23:13,602
Yes.

432
00:23:13,637 --> 00:23:15,971
Do you know what this is?

433
00:23:16,006 --> 00:23:18,073
Madre Di Dios.

434
00:23:18,108 --> 00:23:20,876
A hundred bottles made once a year

435
00:23:20,911 --> 00:23:22,912
by monks in the Italian countryside.

436
00:23:22,946 --> 00:23:24,713
It's Don Maroni's favorite.

437
00:23:24,748 --> 00:23:26,549
What's your point?

438
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,050
Oh, it's just a piece of information

439
00:23:28,084 --> 00:23:30,886
that might be useful one day.

440
00:23:30,921 --> 00:23:32,621
I like information.

441
00:23:34,491 --> 00:23:37,159
If I help you find where
Loeb keeps his files,

442
00:23:37,193 --> 00:23:40,296
you give me ten minutes alone with them.

443
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,331
I take what I want.

444
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:47,169
- This is not a good idea.
- Five minutes.

445
00:23:47,204 --> 00:23:50,005
And you don't touch anything
that has to do with cops.

446
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,276
Five minutes with the files
and a favor from Jim Gordon?

447
00:23:54,311 --> 00:23:55,611
Done!

448
00:23:58,148 --> 00:24:00,149
So who's up for a road trip?

449
00:24:00,183 --> 00:24:02,451
We have to give Fish more time.

450
00:24:02,485 --> 00:24:04,620
She'll get us out of here; she promised.

451
00:24:04,654 --> 00:24:06,589
Can't you see she abandoned us?

452
00:24:06,623 --> 00:24:09,425
Got herself out and left us here to rot.

453
00:24:09,459 --> 00:24:12,628
I say we kill this one,
let them know we're serious.

454
00:24:12,662 --> 00:24:15,531
- Fish said...
- Fish, Fish, Fish.

455
00:24:15,565 --> 00:24:17,800
Where's Fish now?!

456
00:24:17,834 --> 00:24:19,802
Yoo-hoo.

457
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:24,640
I'm disappointed.

458
00:24:24,674 --> 00:24:26,175
I told you I was coming back.

459
00:24:26,209 --> 00:24:28,711
What, you didn't believe me?

460
00:24:28,745 --> 00:24:32,515
Family is built on trust,
and that's what we are.

461
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:34,517
A family.

462
00:24:34,551 --> 00:24:38,220
Fish, I tried, I did.

463
00:24:38,255 --> 00:24:40,389
I know you did.

464
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:45,728
So where's everything you promised?

465
00:24:45,762 --> 00:24:48,797
- When do we get out?
- First thing's first.

466
00:24:48,832 --> 00:24:50,866
I spoke to the man upstairs

467
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:54,170
about our demands for better
conditions, better food.

468
00:24:54,204 --> 00:24:57,640
He asked for a show of good faith.

469
00:24:57,674 --> 00:25:00,476
We're gonna return his guard.

470
00:25:02,245 --> 00:25:03,712
Let him go.

471
00:25:03,747 --> 00:25:06,348
Now.

472
00:25:19,296 --> 00:25:20,796
Next...

473
00:25:24,835 --> 00:25:27,102
What?

474
00:25:27,137 --> 00:25:29,338
- What are they doing?
- I'm sorry, honey.

475
00:25:29,372 --> 00:25:30,739
You're on the list. Doctor's orders.

476
00:25:30,774 --> 00:25:32,575
Fish...

477
00:25:32,609 --> 00:25:33,576
Fish!

478
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:34,844
I told you, didn't I?

479
00:25:34,878 --> 00:25:37,213
She's working for them now!

480
00:25:37,247 --> 00:25:38,914
I warned you not everyone would live.

481
00:25:38,949 --> 00:25:42,418
Their sacrifice means your survival!

482
00:25:42,452 --> 00:25:45,554
And my promise remains the same.

483
00:26:01,171 --> 00:26:03,572
You sure about this, Penguin?

484
00:26:03,607 --> 00:26:05,908
You're telling me this is
where Loeb keeps 20 years

485
00:26:05,942 --> 00:26:08,138
of dirty secrets?

486
00:26:08,188 --> 00:26:09,411
Doesn't feel right.

487
00:26:09,446 --> 00:26:12,381
Well, maybe that's the point.
No one would suspect it.

488
00:26:12,415 --> 00:26:14,383
What would you prefer, Detective Bullock?

489
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:16,085
A sign saying "Super
secret blackmail hoard"?

490
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:17,653
You know, the last time

491
00:26:17,687 --> 00:26:21,123
the three of us took a
ride, you were in the trunk.

492
00:26:21,158 --> 00:26:22,925
I liked that better.

493
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:25,633
I told you,

494
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:27,997
I overheard Falcone on the phone to Loeb.

495
00:26:28,031 --> 00:26:30,399
He said the farm was safe.

496
00:26:30,433 --> 00:26:33,335
Now, I'll wait here, and when you're done,

497
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:35,337
flash the lights or something.

498
00:26:35,372 --> 00:26:37,573
Uh-uh. You're coming along.

499
00:26:37,607 --> 00:26:40,342
But if whoever's inside sees me
and reports back to Falcone...

500
00:26:40,377 --> 00:26:42,111
Then you'll be in some really deep doo.

501
00:26:42,145 --> 00:26:44,747
What'd you think, huh?

502
00:26:44,781 --> 00:26:46,482
We were gonna go do your dirty work,

503
00:26:46,516 --> 00:26:49,185
and then you were just gonna waltz
in and pick through the leavings?

504
00:26:49,219 --> 00:26:51,821
Have some respect.

505
00:26:54,224 --> 00:26:57,560
- You fellas lost?
- Good evening, sir.

506
00:26:57,594 --> 00:27:00,162
We were sent by Commissioner Loeb.

507
00:27:00,197 --> 00:27:03,466
Might we have a word? Out of the cold?

508
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,936
Well, Marge is putting on some tea.

509
00:27:12,442 --> 00:27:14,176
I love your house.

510
00:27:14,211 --> 00:27:16,045
- It's so cozy.
- Thank you.

511
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:17,713
How long have you two been here?

512
00:27:17,747 --> 00:27:20,549
Oh, well, about, uh, 20 years.

513
00:27:20,584 --> 00:27:22,551
Ever since Mr. Loeb bought the place.

514
00:27:22,586 --> 00:27:24,954
Hard to believe.

515
00:27:24,988 --> 00:27:27,289
Time, boy.

516
00:27:27,324 --> 00:27:28,891
You should've seen Margie back then.

517
00:27:28,925 --> 00:27:30,393
Hot to trot.

518
00:27:33,063 --> 00:27:34,830
What were you doing before that?

519
00:27:34,865 --> 00:27:37,733
Oh, nothing much. Uh, Margie
was a nurse over at Arkham.

520
00:27:37,768 --> 00:27:40,136
And I working on the rail road.

521
00:27:43,774 --> 00:27:45,674
Why are you men here?

522
00:27:46,543 --> 00:27:49,245
Oh, uh, inspection.

523
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,229
Commissioner Loeb has some
concerns about security.

524
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:54,250
We didn't hear nothing about it.

525
00:27:57,788 --> 00:28:00,589
- You didn't get a letter?
- No.

526
00:28:00,624 --> 00:28:02,525
That's odd.

527
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,727
Y-You should have gotten a letter.

528
00:28:04,761 --> 00:28:06,328
You got I.D.?

529
00:28:06,363 --> 00:28:08,497
Well, I don't know
that that's necessary.

530
00:28:08,532 --> 00:28:10,533
No, no. It's fine.

531
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:12,234
Jim Gordon, GCPD.

532
00:28:12,269 --> 00:28:14,537
This is Detective Bullock.

533
00:28:14,571 --> 00:28:16,505
We're on the commissioner's
personal detail.

534
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,275
He don't look like a cop.

535
00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:21,077
I'm undercover.

536
00:28:23,914 --> 00:28:25,776
Damn raccoons.

537
00:28:27,484 --> 00:28:30,019
Jim, what do you say we
get on with our inspection?

538
00:28:30,053 --> 00:28:32,855
Mm. Perhaps you wouldn't
mind showing us around.

539
00:28:32,889 --> 00:28:33,989
Oh, absolutely.

540
00:28:34,024 --> 00:28:36,025
Marge, would you mind fetching my keys?

541
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:37,359
Sure.

542
00:28:37,394 --> 00:28:38,527
Now, listen,

543
00:28:38,562 --> 00:28:41,130
before you go, you fellas
have got to get a piece

544
00:28:41,164 --> 00:28:42,465
of Marge's cake.

545
00:28:42,499 --> 00:28:44,100
She makes it with sour cream.

546
00:28:44,134 --> 00:28:46,544
Tastes like a warm Sunday morning.

547
00:28:48,672 --> 00:28:51,040
That's one hell of a big raccoon.

548
00:28:51,074 --> 00:28:52,541
Maybe we should start upstairs.

549
00:28:52,576 --> 00:28:55,444
Oh, just wait a lick for the keys.

550
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:57,146
Margie-pie, that was quick.

551
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,581
Ma'am, put down the...

552
00:29:11,094 --> 00:29:12,762
Freeze!

553
00:29:16,933 --> 00:29:18,901
Thanks, Jim.

554
00:29:18,935 --> 00:29:20,936
- You saved my li...
- Watch them.

555
00:29:27,811 --> 00:29:31,614
You're lucky I have a
soft spot for old ladies.

556
00:30:04,548 --> 00:30:06,615
Oh.

557
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:08,718
Uh...

558
00:30:08,752 --> 00:30:11,887
I-It's so quiet downstairs.

559
00:30:11,922 --> 00:30:14,724
Is the party over?

560
00:30:14,758 --> 00:30:16,959
I-I prepared a song.

561
00:30:16,993 --> 00:30:20,496
It includes a dance and everything.

562
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,064
Who the hell are you?

563
00:30:22,099 --> 00:30:25,468
I'm Miriam Loeb.

564
00:30:25,502 --> 00:30:28,070
Did-did my father send you?

565
00:30:43,414 --> 00:30:44,881
Ms. Kringle.

566
00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:46,383
Oh, Mr. Nygma.

567
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:47,717
Ms. Kringle, I was wondering

568
00:30:47,752 --> 00:30:49,386
if you had dinner plans this evening.

569
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,822
Oh, um... actually, I...

570
00:30:52,857 --> 00:30:55,325
I do. With Tom.

571
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:56,626
Have-have you met Tom?

572
00:30:56,661 --> 00:30:58,595
You're the guy that likes riddles.

573
00:30:58,629 --> 00:31:02,571
Hey, what has hands but can't clap?

574
00:31:03,045 --> 00:31:04,734
- A clock.
- Correct.

575
00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:06,636
He's good.

576
00:31:06,671 --> 00:31:07,671
You're good.

577
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,608
Am I correct to assume that this is your...

578
00:31:11,642 --> 00:31:14,110
uh, your new boyfriend?

579
00:31:14,145 --> 00:31:15,979
Yeah... Yes, I guess so.

580
00:31:16,013 --> 00:31:16,947
You betcha.

581
00:31:16,981 --> 00:31:18,648
Oh.

582
00:31:18,683 --> 00:31:21,151
Congratulations, sir.

583
00:31:21,185 --> 00:31:22,852
Thank you.

584
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:24,854
Well, we should probably

585
00:31:24,889 --> 00:31:26,256
- get going.
- Okay.

586
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,958
It's nice to meet you.

587
00:31:27,992 --> 00:31:30,894
Riddle man, next time...

588
00:31:30,928 --> 00:31:32,529
I'm gonna stump you.

589
00:31:32,563 --> 00:31:36,032
Yes. Next time.

590
00:31:54,385 --> 00:31:57,454
So, Miriam, you live up here all the time?

591
00:31:57,488 --> 00:31:58,455
Always.

592
00:31:58,489 --> 00:32:01,892
Uh, ever since...

593
00:32:01,926 --> 00:32:05,395
I, uh... I'm not alone though.

594
00:32:05,429 --> 00:32:08,832
Father comes to visit on Sundays.

595
00:32:08,866 --> 00:32:12,791
And we listen to the
radio and play checkers.

596
00:32:12,953 --> 00:32:14,905
He always lets me win.

597
00:32:14,939 --> 00:32:18,174
My dad used to do the same thing.

598
00:32:18,209 --> 00:32:19,876
Oh. Really?

599
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,246
Fathers are funny like that, aren't they?

600
00:32:23,281 --> 00:32:24,748
Yeah, your dad's a real hoot.

601
00:32:24,782 --> 00:32:27,851
Does he keep other stuff up here?

602
00:32:27,885 --> 00:32:29,452
Like important papers or files

603
00:32:29,487 --> 00:32:32,489
or maybe rooms full of boxes?

604
00:32:32,523 --> 00:32:34,224
No.

605
00:32:34,258 --> 00:32:36,092
Why would he do that?

606
00:32:37,795 --> 00:32:39,696
This is a waste of time.

607
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,801
Miriam...

608
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,708
what happened to your mother?

609
00:32:51,742 --> 00:32:54,311
She...

610
00:32:54,345 --> 00:32:56,179
died.

611
00:32:56,214 --> 00:32:58,181
I, um...

612
00:32:58,216 --> 00:33:00,668
I've started a new hobby.

613
00:33:00,756 --> 00:33:03,520
- Would you like to see?
- Sure.

614
00:33:03,554 --> 00:33:05,555
Oh, great.

615
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:09,593
What are you doing?

616
00:33:09,627 --> 00:33:11,928
Loeb's wife died 20 years ago.

617
00:33:11,963 --> 00:33:15,799
Skull fracture from a fall down the stairs.

618
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:17,734
Miriam would've been a teenager.

619
00:33:17,768 --> 00:33:20,136
So you think Loeb killed
her? She was the witness?

620
00:33:20,171 --> 00:33:21,905
That's why he keeps her cooped up here?

621
00:33:21,939 --> 00:33:24,908
You said I wasn't the
only one with a Cobblepot.

622
00:33:24,942 --> 00:33:26,743
Maybe this is his.

623
00:33:26,777 --> 00:33:29,773
I started making jewelry.

624
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:38,822
What's it made of?

625
00:33:38,856 --> 00:33:41,825
Bones.

626
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:44,327
Starlings.

627
00:33:44,362 --> 00:33:46,329
They, uh...

628
00:33:46,364 --> 00:33:48,832
they land on my windowsill,

629
00:33:48,866 --> 00:33:52,602
and... you can catch them

630
00:33:52,637 --> 00:33:56,506
if you're really silent and still.

631
00:33:56,541 --> 00:34:01,211
And I can
be really silent and still.

632
00:34:02,947 --> 00:34:06,116
Silent as a mouse.

633
00:34:07,151 --> 00:34:09,853
Then what do you do?

634
00:34:09,887 --> 00:34:12,689
I...

635
00:34:12,723 --> 00:34:16,293
crush the back of their heads.

636
00:34:16,999 --> 00:34:18,995
I just press down with my thumb.

637
00:34:20,998 --> 00:34:23,033
It makes, like, a...

638
00:34:23,067 --> 00:34:24,801
a popping noise.

639
00:34:26,537 --> 00:34:28,138
Pop.

640
00:34:34,979 --> 00:34:37,347
Miriam...

641
00:34:40,184 --> 00:34:43,053
can you tell us about your mother's death?

642
00:34:46,557 --> 00:34:49,893
I'm a good person.

643
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:54,498
Sometimes good people make mistakes.

644
00:34:54,532 --> 00:34:58,134
That's what Father said.

645
00:34:58,169 --> 00:35:01,538
Did you make a mistake with your mother?

646
00:35:01,572 --> 00:35:04,508
Was it like what happens with the birds?

647
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:07,878
No.

648
00:35:07,912 --> 00:35:10,347
Not like with the birds.

649
00:35:10,381 --> 00:35:12,349
Silly.

650
00:35:14,252 --> 00:35:17,187
I had to use a candlestick on her.

651
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:23,126
She wouldn't stop singing either.

652
00:35:23,161 --> 00:35:26,730
She knew that it was my night.

653
00:35:26,764 --> 00:35:30,200
I was supposed to perform at dinner.

654
00:35:30,234 --> 00:35:32,068
Not her.

655
00:35:32,103 --> 00:35:34,337
So you hit her and she stopped.

656
00:35:34,372 --> 00:35:36,840
And your dad covered it up.

657
00:35:36,874 --> 00:35:40,777
He knew that it was my night.

658
00:35:53,391 --> 00:35:56,059
I'm sorry, Jim. They-they
came at me. I tried...

659
00:36:01,063 --> 00:36:03,200
Did you find
what Loeb's hiding?

660
00:36:03,234 --> 00:36:04,868
Is it here?

661
00:36:04,902 --> 00:36:06,303
Yes.

662
00:36:06,337 --> 00:36:08,305
Well, a deal's a deal.

663
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:10,707
You have to let me in there.

664
00:36:10,741 --> 00:36:12,442
Who's he?

665
00:36:12,477 --> 00:36:14,778
He looks just like a bird.

666
00:36:17,114 --> 00:36:19,716
Oh, I love birds.

667
00:36:32,841 --> 00:36:35,476
I see you still haven't
learned the art of knocking,

668
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,511
Detective Gordon.

669
00:36:50,892 --> 00:36:53,294
Miriam is sick.

670
00:36:56,665 --> 00:36:58,633
She didn't mean to hurt her mother.

671
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:00,868
She just...

672
00:37:00,903 --> 00:37:03,871
has these urges.

673
00:37:03,906 --> 00:37:06,207
If you want to expose
what she did, go ahead.

674
00:37:06,241 --> 00:37:07,942
You think I can't weather the scandal?

675
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:09,944
I'm sure you could.

676
00:37:10,953 --> 00:37:13,390
But that's not why you kept
her locked away for 20 years.

677
00:37:13,427 --> 00:37:15,116
Do enlighten me.

678
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,452
I think you love her.

679
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:20,955
I think you've done everything you can

680
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:24,458
to keep her out of Arkham.

681
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:26,961
And you'll keep doing it.

682
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,197
You're willing to hold my daughter hostage

683
00:37:29,231 --> 00:37:30,598
to achieve your ends?

684
00:37:30,632 --> 00:37:33,034
You're much colder than I thought.

685
00:37:33,068 --> 00:37:36,237
So it seems.

686
00:37:36,271 --> 00:37:38,973
I'll hand in my resignation today.

687
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,608
Just keep Miriam out of it.

688
00:37:40,642 --> 00:37:42,777
No, you're not resigning.

689
00:37:42,811 --> 00:37:46,180
You step down, I'll have
someone else to deal with.

690
00:37:46,215 --> 00:37:50,051
And chances are he'll be
Falcone's lapdog, same as you.

691
00:37:50,085 --> 00:37:52,653
With you...

692
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:54,689
I have leverage.

693
00:37:57,693 --> 00:37:59,560
So what do you want?

694
00:37:59,595 --> 00:38:02,230
Flass is tried.

695
00:38:02,264 --> 00:38:04,098
Fairly.

696
00:38:04,132 --> 00:38:06,467
And I want all the
evidence you have on Bullock

697
00:38:06,502 --> 00:38:10,771
and every other cop in the
GCPD sent to Harvey Dent.

698
00:38:10,806 --> 00:38:14,642
- He'll decide who to prosecute.
- No.

699
00:38:14,676 --> 00:38:18,946
I do that, I'm a dead man.

700
00:38:18,981 --> 00:38:22,250
I love Miriam, but I love living, too.

701
00:38:24,253 --> 00:38:27,121
You can have Bullock's file.

702
00:38:27,156 --> 00:38:29,157
But not the rest.

703
00:38:34,196 --> 00:38:36,164
Fine.

704
00:38:36,198 --> 00:38:39,667
And Miriam stays where she is.

705
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:42,670
Is that all?

706
00:38:42,704 --> 00:38:46,541
There's one more thing.

707
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:49,710
It's become something of
a habit to stand up here

708
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:52,380
with Detective Gordon, but
with the coming election

709
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:56,017
for president of the policemen's union,

710
00:38:56,051 --> 00:38:58,986
there's no man I'd rather support.

711
00:39:03,992 --> 00:39:07,528
Thank you, Commissioner Loeb.

712
00:39:07,563 --> 00:39:11,065
It's a new day in the GCPD.

713
00:39:20,409 --> 00:39:22,810
Sorry I missed your big moment.

714
00:39:22,845 --> 00:39:26,047
I figured I'd catch the next one.

715
00:39:26,081 --> 00:39:27,515
Your file.

716
00:39:31,887 --> 00:39:35,556
It's everything Loeb has on you.

717
00:39:35,591 --> 00:39:37,558
Always hated that picture.

718
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,161
You know, you tell yourself...

719
00:39:47,736 --> 00:39:50,023
"I'll just do this one bad thing,

720
00:39:51,023 --> 00:39:53,861
but all the good things I'll
do later will make up for it."

721
00:39:55,511 --> 00:39:58,746
But they don't.

722
00:39:58,781 --> 00:40:01,616
There's still that bad thing.

723
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:07,021
Penguin's gonna come asking for that favor.

724
00:40:07,056 --> 00:40:10,258
Be careful.

725
00:40:19,601 --> 00:40:21,969
I know we had a deal.

726
00:40:22,004 --> 00:40:25,473
I let you go, and you escape
the inevitable punishment

727
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:26,974
that will descend on your heads

728
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:29,440
when Commissioner Loeb
hears of your failure.

729
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,246
Unfortunately, I was only able

730
00:40:32,281 --> 00:40:36,050
to acquire one ticket to Arizona.

731
00:40:37,194 --> 00:40:38,781
So who's it gonna be?

732
00:40:40,789 --> 00:40:43,658
Margie and I have been
together for 20 years.

733
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:45,293
We're not splitting up.

734
00:40:46,996 --> 00:40:49,163
Life can be cruel sometimes.

735
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,801
How do we decide who goes?

736
00:40:55,838 --> 00:40:58,339
I leave that in your hands.

737
00:41:00,376 --> 00:41:02,343
Wait a minute!

738
00:41:02,378 --> 00:41:04,812
Margie! Margie!

739
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:12,353
Whoa.

740
00:41:20,362 --> 00:41:22,130
Here we go.

741
00:41:22,164 --> 00:41:23,197
Here we go!

742
00:41:35,277 --> 00:41:37,111
What time is the train?

743
00:41:37,146 --> 00:41:39,714
Oh, there's no train.

744
00:41:39,748 --> 00:41:41,950
- I just needed your help.
- What?

745
00:41:41,984 --> 00:41:44,886
I was down to one shell.

746
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:50,959
I've been thinking of
introducing salsa night.

747
00:41:50,993 --> 00:41:54,262
Do you think our guests would like that?

748
00:41:56,298 --> 00:41:57,865
No.

749
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,868
Honest. Good.

750
00:42:00,903 --> 00:42:03,304
But... I like salsa.

751
00:42:03,339 --> 00:42:06,307
Tuesday it is.

752
00:42:06,342 --> 00:42:09,811
So... you've completed your task,

753
00:42:09,845 --> 00:42:13,748
and the lines of supply
are open once again.

754
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:16,351
I am duly impressed.

755
00:42:17,353 --> 00:42:20,321
Hope is a carrot easily dangled

756
00:42:20,356 --> 00:42:22,257
in front of the desperate, Doctor.

757
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:28,229
And you have earned your carrot.

758
00:42:28,264 --> 00:42:31,266
Welcome to upper management.

759
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,435
I think you'll find the view
better than in the basement.

760
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,437
In fact...

761
00:42:38,707 --> 00:42:41,709
You see why I can trust you.

762
00:42:41,744 --> 00:42:45,747
Why I'm not worried about
you betraying me and escaping.

763
00:42:48,117 --> 00:42:51,452
Yes. I see.

764
