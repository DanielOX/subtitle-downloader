1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:02,768
<i>Previously on</i> gotham...

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,770
Listen, there are
things I need to do.
If you stay, I stay.

3
00:00:04,772 --> 00:00:06,972
Zsasz:
<i>My name is victor zsasz.</i>

4
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:09,842
I'm here for jim gordon.
Everybody out.

5
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:12,311
Essen:
<i>There's not a single cop</i>
<i>in this city</i>

6
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:13,379
<i>Who'll help you.</i>

7
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:15,214
I won't help you.
I'm not leaving.

8
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:19,952
You don't have to join me.
I figure I'm doomed anyhow.

9
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:21,620
<i>I might as well
join the good guys.</i>

10
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:23,355
Mooney:
<i>I ain't looking for no girl.</i>

11
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,790
<i>I'm looking for a weapon.</i>

12
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:26,625
Excuse me.

13
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,660
You want to start a war
over this punk?

14
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:30,062
The little guy amuses me.

15
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:31,663
Falcone:
<i>Why go to war over trifles?</i>

16
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:32,731
We'll let you have him.

17
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:34,566
Our gift to you.

18
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,141
(panting quietly)

19
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,613
Oh, god, oh, god.

20
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,628
(yells)

21
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:05,164
(grunting)

22
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,170
(yells)

23
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:30,823
(choking)

24
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,632
(grunts)

25
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:44,269
(moaning)

26
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,543
(foghorn blares)

27
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:53,378
(helicopter blades whirring)

28
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,148
(seagulls screeching)

29
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,449
(coffee spills)
oh.

30
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,718
Hell of a way
to start the day.

31
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,253
I mean, I just cleaned this.

32
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:02,554
Harvey.

33
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:03,789
Hey.

34
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:04,990
Uniforms found the body.

35
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:07,893
No wallet,
no id, no watch.

36
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:09,628
He got beaten
up pretty good.

37
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,263
I'm guessing the cause of
death is that gigantic gash

38
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:12,764
In the side
of his neck.

39
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,433
You think? What's all
the black on him?

40
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:15,767
Ink? Paint?

41
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,269
Hmm.

42
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:18,271
Good morning, ed.

43
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:19,771
Detective.

44
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,007
Going by overall coagulation,

45
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:25,110
I'd say time of death
is midnight. But...

46
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:26,745
He's only been here
for a couple hours.

47
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:28,514
Rats have just
started on his ears.

48
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:30,182
Sneaky little buggers.

49
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:31,184
So, not a mugging.

50
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:32,584
Muggers don't
move the body.

51
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:34,820
Abrasions on
his knuckles...

52
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:36,155
Put up a fight.

53
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:38,090
Yeah.
Look at the suspenders.

54
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:39,625
I'm guessing he's
some kind of finance guy.

55
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:42,461
Maybe it was an abduction
ransom thing gone wrong.

56
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:44,163
He resists,
ka-chunk!

57
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:46,165
Do you want to talk to the
uniforms that found the body?

58
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,466
Uh, you do it.

59
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:48,634
We should canvass

60
00:02:48,636 --> 00:02:50,302
The area, though;
a lot of homeless around here.

61
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:51,537
I'll get some unis on it.

62
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:52,771
I'll handle it myself.

63
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,306
Hey, joe!

64
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:56,441
Go smoke somewhere else, huh?

65
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:57,809
Come on, jim, that's what
we got uniforms for.

66
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:58,811
Let them do it.

67
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:00,379
And I'd rather handle it myself.

68
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:01,547
Detectives...

69
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:03,215
I'm guessing I should run
all the prints?

70
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,717
Yeah, ed,
run the prints.

71
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:06,785
This one, too?

72
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,360
Yeah, ed, that one, too.

73
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,633
It wasn't even a proper yacht.

74
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,602
No, it's more like a dinghy.

75
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:27,639
Can I help you?

76
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,808
What a lovely brooch.

77
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,076
Thank you.

78
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,412
May I have it?

79
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:34,580
(laughs)

80
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:37,849
I have a friend
who would love that.

81
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,818
Excuse me?
Oh...

82
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,986
(laughing)

83
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:43,922
I'm sorry.

84
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:47,259
May I please have it?

85
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,100
You shouldn't have.

86
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:56,602
Oswald:
I wanted to
make a gesture.

87
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:59,104
I hope, in time,

88
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,439
We can be friends.

89
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:01,673
Friends?

90
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:03,175
Hmm.

91
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:04,743
Sure.

92
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,211
Why not?
What's done is done.

93
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,513
I'm so glad you feel that way.

94
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,415
Don maroni
wants us

95
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,184
To clarify terms.

96
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:13,752
Well, it's business as usual.

97
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,521
Maroni still has
his drugs, his unions.

98
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,690
He pays tariff
for the ports.

99
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:19,958
If he needs favors
from the cops

100
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,928
Or the mayor,
don falcone will consider it.

101
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,897
And, of course, the families
still share arkham.

102
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,367
And there is to be no blood
spilled on either side.

103
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:29,801
Not a drop.

104
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,203
Hmm...

105
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:33,438
Maybe just a drop.

106
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,040
(laughing)

107
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,708
(clucks tongue)

108
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,776
(laughing)

109
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,077
Look at you.

110
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,412
Timothy,

111
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:44,716
Do you know this fellow
used to have your job?

112
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:47,719
Carried my umbrella
and thought it an honor.

113
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:50,055
Now look at him.

114
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:51,556
Has a seat at the table.

115
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:53,458
Things change, eh?

116
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,427
I've been blessed.

117
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:57,963
Perhaps I should open your gift.

118
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,201
(gasps)

119
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,605
My goodness.

120
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:08,807
That is beautiful.

121
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,575
Now I feel

122
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:11,777
Awful.

123
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:12,778
I didn't get you anything.

124
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,313
No.

125
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:16,648
Thank you.

126
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,160
Hmm.

127
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:29,162
Sweet.

128
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:30,696
That was uncalled for.

129
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:32,364
I brought you
into my family

130
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:34,199
And I treated you like a son!

131
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,201
And you betrayed me.

132
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,601
For which I suffered.

133
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:37,669
Not enough.

134
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,971
When I order some fool killed,

135
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,374
I expect him to stay that way.

136
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,042
Your boss, don falcone,

137
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,210
Expressly said...

138
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:46,611
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
he wants peace.

139
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,947
He's the only reason
why your ass is still alive.

140
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,649
And if I were you,
I would

141
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:54,219
<i>Pray</i> for his good health.

142
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,354
(laughing)

143
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:57,022
Oh, I do.

144
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,690
I do.

145
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,158
Good.

146
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,860
'cause remember...

147
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,397
...Things change.

148
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,833
Convey my respects to your don.

149
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:09,134
Likewise.

150
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:11,536
Peace...

151
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,771
Friend.

152
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:27,652
(school bell ringing)

153
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:30,155
(children talking, laughing)

154
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:31,490
Alfred:
Come now, master bruce.

155
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,859
Had to happen sooner or later.

156
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:35,594
Is this really necessary?

157
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,162
Homeschooling is
just as effective.

158
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:38,330
I can show you the data.

159
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:40,399
You need to be around children
your own age.

160
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,504
Why?

161
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:47,005
'cause you do.

162
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,774
You know I despise
that sort of answer.

163
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:50,942
Don't you miss your mates?

164
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:53,178
Not really.

165
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,781
I've always found them
kind of childish.

166
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,382
Well, that's what they're
meant to be, aren't they?

167
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:58,617
That's what they do.

168
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,053
Don't you want to be

169
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,221
Like a normal kid?

170
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,223
I'm not sure.

171
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,859
Define "normal"
and make a good case for it.

172
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:09,628
You're going to bloody school.
(bell tolling)

173
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,996
Now start walking.

174
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,808
Good luck, lad.

175
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,245
Gordon: Very sorry
for your loss, ma'am.

176
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:28,380
Can you think of anyone

177
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:29,781
Who would want to hurt
your son coleman?

178
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:30,982
No, sir.

179
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,451
Nobody.

180
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:33,985
He was a good boy.

181
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,320
Yes, ma'am, I can see that.

182
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:37,556
No arrests.
An honest young man.

183
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:39,891
What did he do for a living?

184
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,060
Uh, he worked in a coffee shop.

185
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,229
When we found him,
he was in a suit.

186
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:45,297
Suspenders.

187
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,466
He was looking for
a job in finance.

188
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:49,468
He was very ambitious.

189
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,404
First in our family
to go to college.

190
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:54,072
(crying):
Who would do this, sir?

191
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,273
Why?

192
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,715
We'll do our best
to find out, ma'am.

193
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,744
Gordon's finishing up
with the mother.

194
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,480
So far, nothing off
the severed thumb

195
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:03,114
And none of the city's ers
have seen any thumbless guys.

196
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,250
You think he went black market?

197
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:07,018
That's next on my list.

198
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,153
How's gordon?

199
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,155
Angry.

200
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,322
How would you feel if every cop

201
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:11,456
In the building ran out on you?

202
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,358
And now they
all treat him

203
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,759
Like he's got the plague,

204
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:15,961
'cause seeing him reminds them

205
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,329
Of what cowards they all are.

206
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,032
I'm sorry, cap, I...

207
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,200
I didn't mean you.

208
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,269
Nope.

209
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:26,304
You're right.

210
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:27,772
But he's gotta get over that.

211
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,542
Can't do this
job alone.

212
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:33,178
Lucky he's got you.

213
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,946
Yeah.

214
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,184
♪ ♪

215
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,186
(gasps)

216
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,554
So beautiful.

217
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:44,122
As soon as I saw it,

218
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,323
I thought of you.

219
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,359
Such a good son.

220
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,295
Put it on, put it on.
Oh...

221
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:52,130
(gasps)

222
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:54,165
Wh-what happened?

223
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,300
Who did this?

224
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:56,368
N-nobody.

225
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,036
It's just a scratch.
It's...

226
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,371
Is your mother a fool?

227
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,306
No. Someone

228
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:03,575
Is being mean to my boy.
Hey.

229
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:05,744
It's a tough business.

230
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:09,481
The restaurant business
is so tough these days?

231
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:10,982
Why is that?

232
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,651
My success makes
other people envious.

233
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:15,320
So tell the boss
on these people.

234
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:16,655
This person isn't

235
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:18,657
Scared of the boss.

236
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:20,825
Not like they should be.

237
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:22,160
I don't know why.

238
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:23,395
I know.

239
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,163
When I was
in school,

240
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:28,266
Magda himmelfarb

241
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:31,670
Was so mean to me

242
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:34,339
And teacher did nothing.

243
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:35,507
Why?

244
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:36,509
Because

245
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,511
Such a good dancer I was.

246
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:40,845
And magda,

247
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,714
With her nice hair

248
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:44,049
And her big bosoms,

249
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:46,051
A carthorse.

250
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,519
I meant...

251
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:49,020
Why did the teacher do nothing?

252
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:51,056
Why you
think?

253
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:53,525
"private lessons," they said.

254
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:55,060
I put

255
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:56,728
Stop to that.

256
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,196
You told on them?

257
00:09:58,198 --> 00:09:59,364
Oh, no.

258
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:03,368
I denounced magda's father

259
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,604
To secret police.

260
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,906
(trap snaps, rodent squeals)

261
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:09,474
Ah...

262
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,209
Three weeks he's been

263
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:14,479
Turning up his nose at my traps,

264
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,548
And now, now,
today, a smidge

265
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,717
Of camembert

266
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:19,951
And mr. Rat,

267
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,387
He cannot
resist.

268
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,322
No. Oh, can you?

269
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:25,724
Can you,
my little

270
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:27,959
Greedy baby?

271
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,462
I found out your secret!

272
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:33,231
Yes.

273
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,467
Everybody has a secret.

274
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,404
(screaming)

275
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,406
Morphine!

276
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:42,807
Morphine!

277
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,611
They teach you that
in med school?

278
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,346
Oh...

279
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:49,848
Bullock.

280
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,249
Is that kenny suffield?

281
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:52,484
Smash and grab guy.

282
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,485
Also a real hound
with the ladies.

283
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:54,586
Who shot him?

284
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:55,920
I don't ask.

285
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,355
Well, me and my partner
doing all the rounds

286
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:58,590
Of you black market sawbones.

287
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:00,625
Guy we're looking for

288
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,093
Would've come in
early this morning

289
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,295
Missing a thumb.
Sorry.

290
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,830
You'd tell us if you knew,
wouldn't you, doc?

291
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:06,998
I mean,
that's the deal, right?

292
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,334
You give us info
and we let you keep operating?

293
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:12,337
That's a pun. Operating.

294
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,206
Bullock, black ink,

295
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,675
Just like on the victim.

296
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,643
Oh, doc.

297
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,679
Fine.

298
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:22,714
He came in about 3:00
this morning.

299
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:24,015
Didn't give a name,

300
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,884
But this dropped
out of his pocket.

301
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,520
Sionis investments.

302
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:29,487
What'd he look like?

303
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:30,655
Mid-20s.

304
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,457
Suit, suspenders.

305
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:33,992
Just like our dead guy.

306
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:36,494
Sorry, doc.

307
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,063
This is gordon.
I need an ambulance

308
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:41,499
And a black and white
at 1856 wilton.

309
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:42,901
Wait!

310
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:45,136
Just... Wait a second.

311
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,871
Just get me alvarez,
will you?

312
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,907
Alvarez: Bullock, bullock,
what the hell, man?

313
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,675
I got a deal with that guy.

314
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:52,477
Deal's off.
But I told you everything.

315
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,145
Yeah, after we
caught you in a lie.

316
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,346
He always lies.

317
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:56,815
You just squeeze him.

318
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:58,817
You're screwing
the rest of us.
Oh, yeah?

319
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,318
How's that feel? You like it?

320
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,419
Hey, enough, enough!

321
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,854
I get it, I get it, huh?

322
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:05,256
None of these sons of bitches
had your back when it mattered,

323
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:06,391
But where was I?

324
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,659
I was there, remember?

325
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:09,394
Falcone, the mayor,
blaze of glory?

326
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,196
Be nice for my sake.

327
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:13,331
I am being nice.
Haven't you learned
your lesson?

328
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,900
We're only alive
because falcone let us live.

329
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,669
You got to go along
to get along, jim.

330
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:19,671
No, I don't.
You think locking up

331
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:22,340
Doc scumbag there
is gonna make a difference?

332
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:24,409
I'm on your side.
I proved that.

333
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,078
Yeah, you did.

334
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,580
So I'm asking you, please,

335
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:31,282
Let the doc out and tomorrow,

336
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:32,784

338
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:41,960
All right, partner?

339
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,764
Sorry, harv.

340
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:49,734
This ain't right, harvey.

341
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:52,303
Alvarez, put a zipper on it!

342
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,614
(door closes)

343
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,219
(gun clicks)

344
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,721
(gasps)
jim.

345
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:11,055
Barbara, what are you...

346
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,924
I heard someone come in,
and you didn't turn

347
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,392
On the light...
So you got out my spare?

348
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:15,460
You were late!

349
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,895
I got nervous.

350
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:18,563
God.
Not the best idea

351
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:20,665
To be handling a firearm
when you've been drinking.

352
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,636
I'm sorry.

353
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:29,140
Look, you've been
through a lot.

354
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,742
It's over now.

355
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:32,911
I am scared, jim.

356
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:35,013
Everywhere I go, I can...

357
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:38,316
I can feel that monster, zsasz,

358
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,718
Stalking me, and I...
He's not a monster.

359
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,389
He's just a man.

360
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,926
I won't let anyone hurt you.

361
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:50,495
How can you promise me that?

362
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,500
Tell me it'll be okay.

363
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,202
(sighs)

364
00:13:57,204 --> 00:14:00,071
Tell me there really aren't
any monsters.

365
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,043
Just...

366
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:07,712
Lie if you have to.

367
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,249
There aren't any monsters.

368
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,170
When are we gonna
get out of here?

369
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:34,572
That's up to you.

370
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,115
Morning.

371
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,484
(sighing):
Hey.

372
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:50,088
I didn't think you were up.

373
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,923
Look, last night was
just nerves...

374
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:54,225
And way too much to drink.

375
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,429
I said I wanted half your life,
and I've got it.

376
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,400
Leave the gun.

377
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,284
I wish it wasn't like this.

378
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:20,518
Do you really?

379
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,220
(sighs)

380
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:24,389
Ignore me. I'm just tired.

381
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:25,690
Go.

382
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:28,026
Catch some bad guys.

383
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,595
(softly):
Okay.

384
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,702
(door opens)

385
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:39,337
(glove snaps)

386
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:43,808
Forensic examination
by edward nygma,

387
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,877
8:42 a.M., gcpd morgue.

388
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:48,780
The room is approximately
19 degrees celsius.

389
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,648
I ate half
a cranberry muffin earlier,

390
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,116
Saving the rest for later.

391
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,398
What do a dead man,
a cruise ship

392
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,833
And emu have in common?

393
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,171
Correct, nothing.

394
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,813
Ever more curious.

395
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,715
Medical examiner:
He what?!

396
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,251
Nygma, how many times
have I told you

397
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:28,586
To stay the hell out of here?

398
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,121
But I discovered something.
You'll discover

399
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:31,990
Your butt in the street
if you keep doing this.

400
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:33,825
Out.

401
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:38,997
Your loss.

402
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,566
You sloppy ignoramus.

403
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,438
Hi, bruce.

404
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,440
Hi.

405
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,612
Brucey, how you doing?

406
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:56,314
Tommy, hey.

407
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:57,815
I'm well, how are you?

408
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,517
You know, chilling.

409
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,588
So, uh, your mom and dad
got killed, huh?

410
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,058
Yes.
You see the whole thing?

411
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,860
The blood and everything?

412
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,795
I'd rather not talk about that.

413
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:11,963
I was just interested.

414
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:13,898
I've never seen
a real dead body.

415
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,801
Was there guts?

416
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,971
I'll be going to class now.

417
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,144
(bell tolling)

418
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,590
Forgive me, mother,
for I have sinned.

419
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:40,825
Mooney:
Funny.

420
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,595
It feels weird, meeting here.

421
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:46,731
You don't want anyone
to see us together.

422
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,667
Falcone has his eyes everywhere.

423
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:52,670
So, where are we?

424
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:53,871
I cook for him,

425
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,506
I sing to him,

426
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:56,908
We go on walks.

427
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,677
I don't know whether
I'm his maid, his lover

428
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,045
Or his mother.

429
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:02,447
Or all three.

430
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:04,882
He cares about you.

431
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:06,084
Yeah.

432
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:07,218
Hmm.

433
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,053
Have you been
inside his private office?

434
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,388
Yeah.

435
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,923
A few times.

436
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:15,693
Inside the right bottom
desk drawer is a ledger.

437
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:18,229
Copy the last two pages.

438
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:19,931
It'll be locked;
you will need a key

439
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,199
Off of his key ring.

440
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:22,934
(scoffs)
how do I get that?

441
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,202
Behind you is a vial.

442
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:26,204
Give it to him.

443
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:27,939
He'll sleep like the dead

444
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,241
For two hours.

445
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:31,909
It won't kill him, will it?

446
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,377
(groans)

447
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:34,545
(chuckles)

448
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,447
Liza,

449
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:40,251
You haven't caught feelings
for the old man, have you?

450
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:42,920
Not at all.

451
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:45,156
No, it won't kill him.

452
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:47,558
Killing him now
would only create chaos.

453
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,061
I need to siphon his strength.

454
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:52,230
So when the time is right,

455
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:54,132
Taking over his organization

456
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:56,667
Will be like slipping
on a glove.

457
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,936
What if one of his men

458
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:00,938
Catches me snooping?

459
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,740
Then you're probably dead.

460
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,511
You leave first.

461
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,887
(indistinct chatter)

462
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,759
Man:
Right, right, right.

463
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:24,595
(overlapping chatter)

464
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:25,763
I'm under a lot of pressure.

465
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,203
(overlapping chatter continues)

466
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:34,338
Something tells me we came
to the right place.

467
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,340
You think?

468
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,409
Mr. Sionis will see you now.

469
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,954
Oh.

470
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:51,489
Richard sionis.

471
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,124
James gordon.

472
00:19:53,126 --> 00:19:54,725
This is my partner,
harvey bullock.

473
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,194
How can I help you detectives?

474
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:58,196
I don't have much time.

475
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,330
You know this man?

476
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:00,498
Coleman lawson?

477
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,633
He might have interviewed
for a job.

478
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,135
Sorry, no.

479
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:06,904
Any of your employees
miss work yesterday?

480
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:09,907
Any of them show up today
with an injured right hand?

481
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,743
I don't take roll call,
detective.

482
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:15,012
You mind if we check?

483
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:17,415
Perhaps you can tell me
what this is about?

484
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,050
Coleman lawson was killed
two night ago.

485
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,652
The man who did it had
your firm's card in his pocket.

486
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:25,356
Well, there's a thousand ways
he could've gotten that.

487
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,725
What's with all
the warrior baloney?

488
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,428
It inspires me.

489
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,364
High finance is tough business.

490
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:35,833
In order to succeed,
you have to be a warrior.

491
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:37,602
No, you don't.

492
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:39,737
You have to be
a good businessman.

493
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,405
Warriors fight wars.

494
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,840
It's different.

495
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:44,108
So you fancy yourself

496
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,543
A killer?

497
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:48,212
Have you killed people,
mr. Sionis?

498
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:50,248
Only metaphorically.

499
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,183
So all this is just
juvenile play acting.

500
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:53,351
Exactly.

501
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:55,019
Thus speaks a man

502
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:56,387
Who's seen actual combat.

503
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:58,189
You've killed people
for real,

504
00:20:58,191 --> 00:20:59,191
Haven't you?

505
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:01,292
True killers are easy to spot.

506
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:03,861
Yes, they are.

507
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:06,731
Why all the masks?

508
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:08,699
A shrink would say
you're hiding something.

509
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:10,201
To the contrary.

510
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:12,470
A mask hides the face,

511
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,538
But frees the soul.

512
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,374
A mask

513
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,075
Speaks the truth.

514
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:19,543
Deep.

515
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,212
How come so many
of your employees

516
00:21:21,214 --> 00:21:22,546
Have scars
and injuries?

517
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:24,982
Our touch football games
get very rough.

518
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:26,617
You're a liar, mr. Sionis.

519
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,620
Such fire.

520
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:32,890
You must miss the battlefield

521
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:34,392
Desperately.

522
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:37,528
I imagine killing gets
quite addictive.

523
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:40,998
You murdered coleman lawson,
didn't you?

524
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,733
Prove it.

525
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:44,568
We will.

526
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,776
I'd give you a good cop routine,

527
00:21:51,778 --> 00:21:53,978
But it's not in my tool kit.

528
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,983
(indistinct chatter)

529
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,507
(water running)

530
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,210
Gcpd.

531
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:28,245
(turns off water)
turn around slowly.

532
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,117
Let me see those hands!

533
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:35,920
(toilet flushes)

534
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:40,458
Don't move!

535
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,526
(both grunting)

536
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,701
You should've waited for me.

537
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,803
(door closes)

538
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:55,473
(school bell ringing)

539
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:57,541
(indistinct chatter)

540
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:04,048
Hey, brucey.

541
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,050
It's bruce.

542
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,585
No "y."

543
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:09,887
No parents, either, so I
can call you what I like.

544
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,922
Please, get out of my way.

545
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:14,158
Snobby little
jerk, isn't he?

546
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,426
For an orphan.

547
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:17,995
You're being very unkind.

548
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:19,897
I don't understand why.

549
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,999
Boy, you're a weirdo.

550
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,001
Your mother must...

551
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:25,102
(grunts)

552
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:27,438
Don't talk about my mother.

553
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,276
Oh, really?

554
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,922
Oh, is that timothy?

555
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:53,397
(chuckles)
we met at fish mooney's, hmm?

556
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:56,567
I'm the fellow who used
to have your job.

557
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:58,936
I was hoping to ask you
a few questions.

558
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,971
I don't know any...
(shushes)

559
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,576
They'll be time for that.

560
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:07,411
First things first.

561
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:09,280
(grunting)

562
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,348
(blows landing,
timothy grunting)

563
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:18,889
Bullock:
Most killers leave their prints

564
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,891
At the crime scene,
but not you, no.

565
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:23,594
You left your whole thumb
in the dead guy's mouth.

566
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:25,563
You got style!
I like you, kid.

567
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:27,264
This is your last chance.

568
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:29,767
Once we walk out that door...

569
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:30,901
It's over.

570
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:32,403
It was self-defense.

571
00:24:32,405 --> 00:24:33,637
Bullock:
Of course it was.

572
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,072
Wasn't that what I said, jim?

573
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:37,308
Didn't I say it was
probably self-defense?

574
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,145
Talk.

575
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,780
Bullock:
Gordon's getting
the rest of his statement.

576
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:44,482
Apparently it was
part of the hiring process.

577
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:47,318
Sionis told the top three
candidates to fight it out.

578
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,953
They weren't supposed
to fight to the death, but...

579
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:50,688
This is unbelievable.

580
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,156
They all signed
confidentiality agreements,

581
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:54,124
So they're accomplices
to whatever happens.

582
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:55,292
Do we know where
the fight was held?

583
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:56,327
Some old office building.

584
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:57,828
The windows were boarded up.

585
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,630
And he was taken there
blindfolded.

586
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:01,298
Yes, ed?

587
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,133
Printer toner.

588
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:05,135
Do you know what
he's talking about?

589
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:07,137
The medical examiner's report
said it was black ink.

590
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:10,007
But I did my own examination,
and it was printer toner.

591
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,942
Also, I pulled staples
from his shoulders.

592
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:14,311
And found graphite chips
between his ribs.

593
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:15,846
Your man was killed
in an office.

594
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,915
Yeah, we're kind of past that,
ed, but thanks.

595
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,318
Is there something else?
Yes.

596
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,153
It made me think of a case
from a year ago.

597
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:24,455
Young man, business suit,

598
00:25:24,457 --> 00:25:26,457
Esophagus lacerated
from index card

599
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:28,392
Shoved down his throat.
So, I did some digging...

600
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:31,128
How many other bodies were
killed with office supplies?

601
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,898
Four... In the last three years.

602
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,332
Essen:
Get that man

603
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:36,800
To sign a confession. Now.

604
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:39,970
I think we have a problem.

605
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:42,139
I explained to detective gordon,
as counsel to mr. Adams

606
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,674
I'd advised him
against speaking further.

607
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:44,808
Also, any statements

608
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,143
He has made will be
considered having

609
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:47,478
Been made under duress.

610
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,147
Uh-huh, and how much is sionis
paying him to take the fall?

611
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:51,715
Good day.

612
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:55,753
He showed up before adams
could sign his statements.

613
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:58,489
We got to figure out where
sionis is staging these fights.

614
00:25:58,491 --> 00:26:01,158
I'll run all the buildings he
or his company owns in gotham.

615
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,160
This make any sense to you?

616
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:05,930
No, but how's it any worse
than the goat or the balloonman?

617
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:08,265
When did this become
normal for this city?

618
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:09,500
What changed?

619
00:26:09,502 --> 00:26:10,601
Maybe nothing.
Maybe it was always

620
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:12,836
Just below the surface.
Only needed a spark.

621
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:14,672
Like thomas and martha
wayne being killed?

622
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:17,675
I'm not blind, gordon.

623
00:26:17,677 --> 00:26:19,376
I know you're
still looking into it.

624
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:22,513
But how could their deaths
have caused all this?

625
00:26:22,515 --> 00:26:24,848
Why were they so important?

626
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,884
I think it's
what they represented.

627
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:29,353
A different gotham.

628
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:30,854
Decent, hopeful.

629
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,091
Whatever it was, it's gone now.

630
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,695
When zsasz came for you,
I should've stayed.

631
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:39,129
I told you to go.

632
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:41,432
That doesn't matter.
I should've stayed.

633
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,368
Now, let's get this guy.

634
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,437
Yeah.

635
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:52,676
(door opens)

636
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:56,046
Tad late, master bruce.

637
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:57,548
Oi.

638
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,116
Oi. What happened to you?
I'm perfectly fine!

639
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,451
What happened?

640
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:06,490
Someone spoke disrespectfully
about my mother.

641
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:09,093
Oh, did they now?

642
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:11,762
Well, I hope you broke
their bastard teeth for them.

643
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:14,098
No.

644
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,833
He's much bigger
than me, and I...

645
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:17,668
I'm not very good at fighting.

646
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,003
Didn't hurt him at all.

647
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:21,538
Not at all?

648
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,975
Don't tell the school.

649
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:29,113
Not bloody likely.

650
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:31,849
Bullock:
<i>Take a look at this.</i>

651
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:33,250
Sionis owns half of gotham!

652
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:34,418
All right, we'll split up.

653
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,020
Focus on the buildings
that are abandoned

654
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:37,321
Or under construction first.

655
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,589
This son of a bitch
is not getting away!

656
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:40,658
I'll say one thing...
he has your number.

657
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,760
What are you talking about?
Sionis.

658
00:27:42,762 --> 00:27:44,595
You may not have put down
cobblepot, jimmy boy,

659
00:27:44,597 --> 00:27:46,497
But you got a demon in you.

660
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:48,432
You can call yourself a soldier,
but all this fighting falcone,

661
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:50,868
Fighting other cops,

662
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,503
You love it.
So, when you find something

663
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:55,706
That seems remotely possible,
call me.

664
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:57,775
(cell phone ringing)

665
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,212
Barbara, everything all right?

666
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:04,148
Fine. I just, uh,

667
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,116
I wanted to check in.

668
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:08,385
Can we talk later? I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

669
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:09,486
Of course.
(laughs)

670
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:11,455
I love...
(clicks, dial tone droning)

671
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:15,726
(phone beeps off)

672
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,634
Man:
Hey!

673
00:28:23,636 --> 00:28:25,636
Boss wants his tea.

674
00:28:25,638 --> 00:28:27,871
It's almost ready.

675
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,233
(lights buzzing)

676
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:02,673
(rattling nearby)

677
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:08,178
Gcpd!

678
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,614
(gasps)

679
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,184
Anybody else here?

680
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,386
(taser clicking)
(grunts)

681
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:18,388
That...

682
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,424
Would be a yes.

683
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,930
All right, cream and sugar.
Yeah.

684
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:33,103
Hey.

685
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:37,141
Uh...

686
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:39,710
Hi.

687
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,879
A girl's got to shop.

688
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,624
(siren wailing in distance)

689
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:00,564
This...

690
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:03,100
Is your father's watch.

691
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:05,169
Don't you lose it now.

692
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:10,073
Tommy elliot's house.

693
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,411
Don't you be scared.

694
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:16,914
I'm not.

695
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:19,316
I'm visualizing
what I'm gonna do.

696
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:20,751
'cause you if you don't want
to do this,

697
00:30:20,753 --> 00:30:22,119
There's no shame in it.

698
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:25,055
There would be
immense shame in it.

699
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,366
(buzzer rings)

700
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:42,773
What the hell
are you doing here?

701
00:30:42,775 --> 00:30:44,474
We have unfinished business.

702
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:46,043
Listen, if you think
you're gonna tell my parents...

703
00:30:46,045 --> 00:30:48,178
(grunts)
are you crazy?!

704
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,114
Don't talk about my mother!

705
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:53,116
Alfred:
Master bruce!

706
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:00,824
Point well made, I think.

707
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:02,025
You all right, mate?

708
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,627
Any broken bones?

709
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:05,162
He-he tried to kill me!

710
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:06,230
That's right.

711
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:07,865
He did.

712
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:08,966
He tried to kill you.

713
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,703
Just you remember that
next time you see him.

714
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:14,538
And you remember

715
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,974
That I let him try.

716
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:19,810
Now, let's get some ice

717
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:21,278
On those knuckles.

718
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,715
What do you fancy
for your dinner?

719
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,083
Pizza.

720
00:31:26,085 --> 00:31:27,150
Pizza?

721
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:30,387
Superb choice,
master bruce.

722
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:31,822
Jim, where the hell are you?

723
00:31:31,824 --> 00:31:34,925
My list crapped out. Call me.

724
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:37,160
Nygma, gordon hasn't
called in, has he?

725
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:41,064
No. But if the detective
becomes the mystery...

726
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:46,536
Sionis (over loudspeaker):
Wake up.

727
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:48,672
Detective gordon?

728
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:50,474
Wake up!

729
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:53,710
So, three of you

730
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:57,180
Applied for a position
at my firm.

731
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:59,883
I explained then

732
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:02,519
You can use anything here
as a weapon

733
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:05,022
And the last man standing
gets the job.

734
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:06,390
However...

735
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:08,525
Tonight is special.

736
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:10,360
You see the man

737
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:12,362
Without the mask?

738
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:15,365
Whoever kills him...
Is the victor.

739
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:16,700
Listen to me.

740
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:18,535
I'm a cop.

741
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:21,238
So far, none of you
have broken any laws.

742
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,873
Let the games...

743
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:24,942
Begin.
(bell rings)

744
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,210
One last chance!

745
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:29,713
Nobody move!
Sionis:
Oh.

746
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:32,115
And I'll throw in a
million-dollar signing bonus.

747
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:35,485
Ah, crap.

748
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,893
Alvarez.

749
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:44,394
I need help checking
these addresses.

750
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:45,562
Gordon might be
in trouble.

751
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:46,830
Busy.

752
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:48,565
I'm gonna remember that
next time your wife calls,

753
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:50,634
Asking where you are,
you putz.

754
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,073
Collins.

755
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:58,141
Listen up, man,
can I have some help?

756
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,648
Now, listen up,
you sons of bitches!

757
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:08,518
So, you don't like gordon!

758
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,586
Fine.

759
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:11,588
He can be a total asshat.

760
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,924
But he is still a cop.

761
00:33:13,926 --> 00:33:16,994
And not one of you, not one,
stood up when he needed it.

762
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:18,595
That ain't happening twice.

763
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,932
I need help checking
these addresses.

764
00:33:21,934 --> 00:33:23,166
Now.

765
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,837
Give me a couple.

766
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:36,513
Okay.

767
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,782
But you cover
with my wife, right?

768
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:40,417
Yeah.

769
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:46,423
(grunting)

770
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:51,028
(cheering)

771
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:00,103
(gasping)

772
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,310
(exclaiming)

773
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,381
(grunting)

774
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:19,089
(murmuring)
it's over.

775
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:21,158
(sword unsheathing)

776
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,164
I knew you had a killer in you.

777
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:29,132
(murmuring)

778
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,768
So...

779
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,770
Where are your brother police?

780
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:35,605
Did they abandon you?

781
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:37,741
I don't need them.

782
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:49,920
(cheering)

783
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:57,160
Seems I'll have to give myself
the million dollars.

784
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:27,491
(sword clatters on floor)

785
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:28,992
Essen:
Jim?

786
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:30,560
(footsteps approaching)
jim?!

787
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:34,998
Jim!

788
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,003
(groans)

789
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:51,014
Thanks.

790
00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:53,550
You're welcome.

You'd better have a good
reason for being here.

800
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:51,975
Did you get what I asked for?

801
00:36:51,977 --> 00:36:54,911
I want out.

802
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,248
No.

803
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,417
He's gonna find out.

804
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:03,420
Maybe not today,
but soon.

805
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:04,988
Is it worth it?

806
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:08,491
You are rich.

807
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:10,493
People are afraid of you.

808
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:12,862
Is that not enough?

809
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:15,198
No.

810
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,435
It's not.

811
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:20,570
I grew up not too
far from here.

812
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,206
One bedroom,
cold water.

813
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:24,874
Just me and my mama.

814
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:27,177
I used to sleep in a
bed behind a curtain.

815
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:30,680
It's where I would hide
when she entertained men.

816
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,851
And that's where I was
when he killed her.

817
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:36,920
One of falcone's men.

818
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:40,056
Didn't like the service.

819
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:41,891
I hid there,

820
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:45,862
Silent, until morning.

821
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:48,865
With my mama two
feet away from me.

822
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:51,067
That night, I made a promise.

823
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:53,370
To get revenge.

824
00:37:53,372 --> 00:37:56,873
To never again be powerless.

825
00:37:56,875 --> 00:38:02,245
To never let any man,
<i>any</i> man, be over me.

826
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:05,815
This is about keeping that
promise to that little girl.

827
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:11,554
So, what's this about?

828
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,991
(chuckles under her breath)

829
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:16,559
This is a thread.

830
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:20,964
I pull this
and falcone comes undone.

831
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:32,809
You're scared.

832
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:36,813
But I won't let
anything happen to you,

833
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,448
And that's a promise.

834
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:41,151
I want you to say...

835
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:43,320
"I believe you, mama."

836
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:46,856
I believe you, mama.

837
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,527
That's my girl.

838
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,834
Oswald: The thing is,
when I had your job,

839
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:00,603
Had someone asked me,
"what is miss mooney's secret?"

840
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:02,906
I could've answered.

841
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,042
Ooh.

842
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:07,911
(chuckles)

843
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,481
Timothy...

844
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:14,351
I think you're
holding back on me.

845
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:16,886
Okay, I...

846
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:18,521
I might've heard her
with butch.

847
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,457
Talking about what?
Whom?

848
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:23,059
Fal... Falcone.

849
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:24,828
She said, "our...

850
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,830
Our friend with falcone."

851
00:39:26,832 --> 00:39:28,231
That's it.

852
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:30,500
She was whispering.
Please.

853
00:39:30,502 --> 00:39:32,869
She has someone
close to falcone.

854
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:36,072
Of course.

855
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:41,211
Thank you.

856
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:45,315
No one can find the body.

857
00:39:45,317 --> 00:39:46,317
No.

858
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:48,218
We are at peace after all.

859
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,353
No! No, please!

860
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:52,489
No! No...!

861
00:39:52,491 --> 00:39:54,991
(distant siren wailing)

862
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:56,559
(low chatter)

863
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:00,497
Bullock: Alvarez and collins
are bringing in sionis' minions.

864
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:02,999
Pansies tried to rabbit when
they saw you cuffing their boss.

865
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:04,067
You okay?

866
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:07,771
Essen told me you made a speech.

867
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:09,506
I wouldn't call it a speech.

868
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:11,374
Said you called me an asshat.

869
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:13,510
I did call you that.

870
00:40:13,512 --> 00:40:16,246
Thank you.

871
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:18,248
For having my back.

872
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:21,351
Now and before.

873
00:40:21,353 --> 00:40:23,620
Just try not to be such
a pain in the neck.

874
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:25,321
Makes my day harder.

875
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,458
You know, you were wrong.

876
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,560
What you said earlier.

877
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:33,029
It's not that I love fighting.

878
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:36,232
But I'm not afraid to, either.

879
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:38,668
And if we don't fight
for this city, who will?

880
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:44,073
I'm not gonna stop, harvey.

881
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:47,811
Falcone, the mayor, every cop
I know that's dirty,

882
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:49,179
I'm gonna get them.

883
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:54,551
You should know that.

884
00:40:54,553 --> 00:40:56,619
Go home, jim.

885
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,998
You were listening
tonight, weren't you?

886
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,068
You gonna get in
trouble, old woman.

887
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:15,505
Heard you telling
that girl stories.

888
00:41:15,507 --> 00:41:20,577
A lie with a heart of truth
is a powerful thing.

889
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:22,645
Go on, it's late.

890
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,892
(phone rings)

891
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:50,306
(answering machine beeps)

892
00:41:50,308 --> 00:41:51,374
Hey, it's me.

893
00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:53,676
I'm coming home soon.

894
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,945
Everything is gonna be better,
I promise.

895
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:57,947
I love you.

896
00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:59,449
Hey, gordon.

897
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:00,550
Got a minute?

898
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:01,552
Can it wait?

899
00:42:01,553 --> 00:42:03,186
Kind of on my way
out of here.

900
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:05,121
Some unis brought in a perp.

901
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:06,289
Claims to know you.

902
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:07,957
Oh, yeah?
What's the charge?

903
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:09,959
B and e, some
fancy store uptown.

904
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:11,528
Pretty
professional job.

905
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:12,795
Kid didn't even
trip the alarm.

906
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:14,797
Kid?

907
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:16,199
Boy or girl?

908
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:17,467
Girl.

909
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:19,702
Said to ask if you been down
any sewers lately.

910
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:28,011
Hey, detective.

911
00:42:28,013 --> 00:42:30,213
Miss me?

912
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:40,490
I enjoyed it.

913
00:42:40,492 --> 00:42:42,592
I enjoyed hurting him.

914
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:44,661
Of course you did.

915
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:50,667
He deserved it.

916
00:42:50,669 --> 00:42:53,736
I'm so angry all the time.

917
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:57,173
Will that ever go away?

918
00:42:57,175 --> 00:43:00,276
That I don't know.

919
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,313
Alfred...

920
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,017
...Can you teach me
how to fight?

921
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:16,859
Yes, master bruce.

922
00:43:16,861 --> 00:43:19,929
Yes, I can.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
