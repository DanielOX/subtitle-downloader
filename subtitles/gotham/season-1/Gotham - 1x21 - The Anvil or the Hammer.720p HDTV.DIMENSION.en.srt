1
00:00:02,742 --> 00:00:03,774
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,243
You need to leave Ms. Kringle alone.

3
00:00:05,602 --> 00:00:07,503
I get it now.

4
00:00:07,536 --> 00:00:08,771
You got a thing for my girl.

5
00:00:08,804 --> 00:00:10,471
Oh!

6
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:13,708
Oh, dear.

7
00:00:15,945 --> 00:00:17,579
Who sent you?

8
00:00:17,614 --> 00:00:19,949
You want me to tell Bunderslaw
that you're onto him?

9
00:00:19,983 --> 00:00:21,917
No!

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,920
I'm Bruce Wayne.

11
00:00:24,954 --> 00:00:25,954
Sid Bunderslaw.

12
00:00:28,073 --> 00:00:30,673
The people of Gotham deserve to know

13
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:33,042
that there's a serial
killer in their midst.

14
00:00:33,078 --> 00:00:34,145
I'm coming after you.

15
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:36,347
He murders the loved ones

16
00:00:36,381 --> 00:00:38,448
of any cop who investigates him.

17
00:00:38,482 --> 00:00:41,317
Care to dance?

18
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,670
Morning. How'd you sleep?

19
00:01:02,704 --> 00:01:05,171
The hour we slept?

20
00:01:05,206 --> 00:01:06,674
Great.

21
00:01:06,707 --> 00:01:09,075
You hungry? I have quiche.

22
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,844
No, thanks.

23
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,079
At least have some coffee.

24
00:01:12,112 --> 00:01:14,013
Let me tell you about the day

25
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:15,483
I have planned for us.

26
00:01:15,516 --> 00:01:17,484
I think I'm just gonna get out of here.

27
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,753
Just wait.

28
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:24,290
We had fun last night, right?

29
00:01:28,906 --> 00:01:30,073
Stay.

30
00:01:32,972 --> 00:01:34,602
Listen, you don't have to do this.

31
00:01:34,635 --> 00:01:36,069
Do what?

32
00:01:36,103 --> 00:01:38,338
Last night at the ball,

33
00:01:38,372 --> 00:01:39,740
you talked a good game.

34
00:01:39,774 --> 00:01:42,075
But let's not pretend this
is more than what it is.

35
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:45,412
Barbara, I'm not pretending with you.

36
00:01:45,447 --> 00:01:46,813
I want you

37
00:01:46,847 --> 00:01:48,353
to stay with me.

38
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:51,317
I don't think so.

39
00:01:51,353 --> 00:01:53,486
Just... wait, wait, wait.

40
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:55,789
Let go.

41
00:01:55,823 --> 00:01:56,893
Look...

42
00:01:58,426 --> 00:02:02,362
I was pretending with you.

43
00:02:02,397 --> 00:02:05,766
But not in the way you think.

44
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:16,210
The night we met...

45
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:19,379
I was going to kill you.

46
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:25,019
- That's not funny.
- But then...

47
00:02:26,052 --> 00:02:29,122
I saw something in you,

48
00:02:29,157 --> 00:02:31,625
Barbara, I saw...

49
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:34,027
the real you.

50
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:41,936
You are the woman that I
have been searching for.

51
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:47,598
You're lying.

52
00:02:51,112 --> 00:02:54,581
I'm gonna let you go now,

53
00:02:54,615 --> 00:02:59,453
and you're going to sit down
and have breakfast with me.

54
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:13,300
Come on.

55
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,070
No!

56
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,793
So I do it the hard way.

57

58
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:32,052
Hey. How are you doing?

59
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,621
Been better. You seen Harvey?

60
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:34,655
No.

61
00:03:34,688 --> 00:03:36,557
Any word on Barbara?

62
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,459
They haven't found her body yet,

63
00:03:38,492 --> 00:03:40,627
so there's a chance she's still alive.

64
00:03:40,662 --> 00:03:42,962
When's the last time you slept?

65
00:03:42,997 --> 00:03:44,064
I don't know.

66
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,966
- Last time you ate?
- I don't know.

67
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:48,269
I know better than to
try to get you to sleep,

68
00:03:48,302 --> 00:03:49,569
but you really should eat something.

69
00:03:49,603 --> 00:03:50,737
I'm not hungry.

70
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:52,840
Jim...

71
00:03:52,873 --> 00:03:54,442
it's not your fault.

72
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,579
I did this. I pressed Loeb,
he sent the Ogre after me,

73
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,449
and I didn't stop.

74
00:04:01,483 --> 00:04:03,683
It was bad enough I
knowingly put you in danger.

75
00:04:03,718 --> 00:04:05,218
I didn't even think of Barbara.

76
00:04:05,252 --> 00:04:07,788
You were doing your job.

77
00:04:07,823 --> 00:04:09,757
- But I should've known.
- How?

78
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,292
Y-You weren't together.

79
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:12,460
Do you blame yourself

80
00:04:12,493 --> 00:04:14,461
for falling out of love?

81
00:04:14,496 --> 00:04:15,830
Lee, it's my responsibility.

82
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:18,132
There's nothing you can
say that changes that.

83
00:04:18,165 --> 00:04:19,632
Whatever happens to Barbara,

84
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:21,802
it's on me.

85
00:04:21,836 --> 00:04:22,870
I understand.

86
00:04:22,903 --> 00:04:24,305
Jimbo!

87
00:04:24,338 --> 00:04:26,606
Meet Jake the JV pimp.

88
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,309
He's been bragging on the streets that

89
00:04:28,343 --> 00:04:30,144
- he knows who the Ogre is.
- I keep telling you,

90
00:04:30,177 --> 00:04:32,230
man, you been lied to;
I don't know nothing.

91
00:04:32,254 --> 00:04:33,254
Yeah?

92
00:04:33,278 --> 00:04:35,279
We'll see about that.

93
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:16,389
Okey doke.

94
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:19,427
No body, no crime. No body, no crime.

95
00:05:21,396 --> 00:05:24,731
Nope. Never seen him before.

96
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,502
We think this is a serial
killer called the Ogre.

97
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,471
He's kidnapped a woman,

98
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:33,774
and he's gonna kill her
unless we find him first.

99
00:05:33,808 --> 00:05:35,276
Bummer.

100
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,843
Just so you understand,

101
00:05:36,877 --> 00:05:39,547
the lady in question is a real good

102
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:40,747
friend of ours.

103
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:43,550
Supposing, for the sake of argument,

104
00:05:43,584 --> 00:05:46,153
I did see him before.

105
00:05:46,187 --> 00:05:47,588
What's she worth?

106
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,225
What's she worth?

107
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:53,226
Yeah, you know,

108
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,516
if you had to assign a dollar amount.

109
00:05:58,766 --> 00:06:00,901
Harvey, I'm about to
violate departmental policy

110
00:06:00,935 --> 00:06:04,404
on interrogation techniques.

111
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:07,807
Think I saw some donuts outside
with my name all over them.

112
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:11,612
Hey, now. C-Calm yourself.

113
00:06:11,646 --> 00:06:14,127
There's no need to get carried...

114
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,685
Jake worked as a barman at a brothel

115
00:06:17,718 --> 00:06:18,985
called the Foxglove.

116
00:06:19,021 --> 00:06:21,622
Said the Ogre was a regular.
Can't give us a location.

117
00:06:21,656 --> 00:06:23,790
Yeah, 'cause they never
use the same place twice.

118
00:06:23,824 --> 00:06:25,824
- What, you know it?
- Not personally.

119
00:06:25,826 --> 00:06:29,096
The Foxglove is very
high-class, very extreme.

120
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,865
You got to know someone who knows someone.

121
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:32,800
Uh, I might know someone.

122
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:34,435
Oh. You talking Penguin?

123
00:06:34,468 --> 00:06:36,971
If you get any deeper with
that clown, he will own you.

124
00:06:37,004 --> 00:06:38,939
I don't have a choice;
the Ogre has Barbara.

125
00:06:38,973 --> 00:06:40,274
Let me shake a few trees.

126
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:41,641
Take the time, grab some z's.

127
00:06:41,677 --> 00:06:43,276
You're burnt!

128
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:46,646
First one was the hardest.

129
00:06:46,682 --> 00:06:48,548
But it wasn't her fault.

130
00:06:48,584 --> 00:06:50,584
She just wasn't the one.

131
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,954
I also couldn't let her go.

132
00:06:52,987 --> 00:06:55,189
Still, it strengthened my resolve

133
00:06:55,223 --> 00:06:57,557
to never stop till I found my soul mate...

134
00:06:57,593 --> 00:06:59,961
Person I could share everything with.

135
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:06,266
I think that person is you,
Barbara, but I need your help.

136
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,536
So...

137
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:11,471
let's begin again, shall we?

138
00:07:26,564 --> 00:07:28,843
This just, uh...

139
00:07:28,877 --> 00:07:31,446
came for you by messenger, Master Bruce.

140
00:07:34,617 --> 00:07:36,617
Thank you.

141
00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:41,555
Right, well, I'll...

142
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,557
I'll just be off.

143
00:07:43,591 --> 00:07:45,026
Do you want company?

144
00:07:46,795 --> 00:07:48,262
To identify Reggie?

145
00:07:48,297 --> 00:07:50,865
No, I don't think so. Best done alone.

146
00:07:52,255 --> 00:07:54,002
I'm sorry, Alfred.

147
00:07:54,747 --> 00:07:56,004
I know he was your friend.

148
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:57,738
Just doesn't make any sense.

149
00:07:57,773 --> 00:08:00,574
Reggie topping himself like that.

150
00:08:00,608 --> 00:08:02,410
You said he fell out of a window.

151
00:08:02,444 --> 00:08:03,978
He might've been
drinking, lost his balance.

152
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,115
No, Reggie, he was a legend.

153
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:11,778
He could be blind drunk
and walk a tightrope.

154
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:16,223
Doesn't matter what he was like in the end.

155
00:08:16,257 --> 00:08:18,793
I want to see he gets a proper send-off.

156
00:08:22,297 --> 00:08:24,298
I'll see you this evening, sir.

157
00:08:49,692 --> 00:08:53,193
What, your boss doesn't trust his partners?

158
00:08:53,227 --> 00:08:55,028
It's called due diligence.

159
00:08:55,063 --> 00:08:57,264
He just wants me to look the place over.

160
00:08:57,298 --> 00:08:58,633
So look.

161
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:02,302
I got a gravy going... Special party today.

162
00:09:02,337 --> 00:09:04,072
Don't let me keep you.

163
00:09:04,105 --> 00:09:06,106
Piece of work.

164
00:09:18,201 --> 00:09:19,886
I'll put the pistol under the bar,

165
00:09:19,922 --> 00:09:21,923
machine gun behind the juke.

166
00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:25,393
All Connor and his guy got to do

167
00:09:25,427 --> 00:09:27,195
is get to them.

168
00:09:27,229 --> 00:09:29,197
The day is finally here.

169
00:09:30,231 --> 00:09:32,100
Maroni...

170
00:09:32,134 --> 00:09:34,001
Jim.

171
00:09:34,036 --> 00:09:36,504
So lovely to see you.

172
00:09:36,538 --> 00:09:40,341
To what do I owe this wonderful surprise?

173
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,043
I need to know where the Foxglove is.

174
00:09:42,076 --> 00:09:44,445
And I need an invitation.

175
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:48,349
Well, someone's in a mood.

176
00:09:48,384 --> 00:09:50,684
Can you help me out? Yes or no.

177
00:09:52,254 --> 00:09:55,722
Jim, I do so love our
give-and-take relationship.

178
00:09:55,758 --> 00:09:58,525
But it's starting to feel a bit one-sided.

179
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:00,160
Fine.

180
00:10:00,195 --> 00:10:02,096
I'll owe you a favor.

181
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,597
You already do.

182
00:10:03,631 --> 00:10:06,600
Then I'll owe you another.

183
00:10:06,634 --> 00:10:09,870
Cards on the table.

184
00:10:09,904 --> 00:10:11,639
The Foxglove makes a lot of money

185
00:10:11,673 --> 00:10:14,153
for some important f...

186
00:10:17,645 --> 00:10:20,213
You think you know who I am.

187
00:10:20,249 --> 00:10:22,482
What I'm capable of.

188
00:10:22,518 --> 00:10:24,451
You have no idea.

189
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:26,405
Today is an important day for me...

190
00:10:27,923 --> 00:10:31,058
so I will accommodate your request.

191
00:10:31,092 --> 00:10:34,895
But, Detective, mark my words.

192
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:37,664
You owe me a big favor.

193
00:10:45,022 --> 00:10:46,740
Here we have the Physical
Operations department.

194
00:10:46,774 --> 00:10:49,344
The Physical Operations department

195
00:10:49,378 --> 00:10:51,446
handles logistics for the corporation,

196
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,380
management of our properties, offices...

197
00:10:53,414 --> 00:10:55,783
Excuse me, I need to use the restroom.

198
00:10:55,817 --> 00:10:58,298
Of course, Mr. Wayne. It's right here.

199
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,921
Thank you.

200
00:11:13,418 --> 00:11:16,070
The Foxglove is in the old
Klondike Building on Mayflower.

201
00:11:16,105 --> 00:11:17,971
- You score a ticket?
- Yep.

202
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:19,039
But only one.

203
00:11:19,073 --> 00:11:21,509
I figure you go in, pose as a john,

204
00:11:21,543 --> 00:11:23,076
find something to bust them on,

205
00:11:23,111 --> 00:11:25,679
then we squeeze them till they talk.

206
00:11:25,713 --> 00:11:27,481
Smart move sending me, hmm?

207
00:11:27,515 --> 00:11:29,956
You couldn't look more like a
cop if you wore a blue uniform.

208
00:11:29,985 --> 00:11:31,753
You got something to wear?

209
00:11:31,787 --> 00:11:33,955
- You, uh, are gonna need to fit in.
- Don't worry.

210
00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:35,956
Alvarez busted some guys
smuggling Italian suits

211
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,493
last week, and a couple fell in my locker

212
00:11:38,527 --> 00:11:40,961
on their way to the evidence room.

213
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,966
I'm sorry I left you alone,

214
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,602
but you needed time to think,

215
00:11:48,636 --> 00:11:51,304
to accept that this was real.

216
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,707
This apartment is soundproofed, by the way,

217
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:55,743
so save your lungs.

218
00:12:11,688 --> 00:12:14,725
Look at me. My hands are shaking.

219
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,525
That's never happened before

220
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:18,721
with any of the other
women that I've had here.

221
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,030
You know why that is?

222
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,836
Do you know why

223
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,803
that is?

224
00:12:27,838 --> 00:12:30,307
You're a psycho.

225
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:32,341
I don't know what you're thinking.

226
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,682
It's because I always somehow knew

227
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:43,886
that deep down, the others weren't the one.

228
00:12:43,921 --> 00:12:45,889
They weren't the one.

229
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,904
I want this to work, Barbara.

230
00:12:57,581 --> 00:12:59,383
You're scared.

231
00:12:59,408 --> 00:13:01,172
It's okay.

232
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:06,519
Jim will find...

233
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:14,226
The only way you're
going to make me angry is

234
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:16,596
if you mention his name.

235
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,606
Drink this.

236
00:13:29,631 --> 00:13:32,267
It's water. You're dehydrated.

237
00:13:41,926 --> 00:13:44,995
Barbara, come here. I
want you to see something.

238
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:51,730
Barbara, I love you.

239
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:54,056
I love you like no one has ever loved you.

240
00:13:54,081 --> 00:13:56,157
But if you try to escape,

241
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:58,322
I will chain you to
the ceiling and gut you.

242
00:13:58,347 --> 00:14:01,316
Now come... here.

243
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:20,092
Are those...

244
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,695
When you're looking for love,

245
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:23,429
you have to kiss a lot of frogs.

246
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:26,991
Still, I-I should be thankful.

247
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:28,868
They led me to you.

248
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:33,606
All those women...

249
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,711
they died here?

250
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,764
You killed them...

251
00:14:40,789 --> 00:14:43,515
here?

252
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:45,485
Yes.

253
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:53,422
Don't worry.

254
00:14:53,447 --> 00:14:55,514
I'm gonna set you free.

255
00:14:55,859 --> 00:14:58,494
You're the one, Barbara.

256
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:00,600
You're the one.

257
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,024
Hello, Bruce.

258
00:15:54,048 --> 00:15:56,616
I've been expecting you.

259
00:16:05,568 --> 00:16:08,139
Ever since your friend borrowed my key,

260
00:16:08,163 --> 00:16:09,787
I've been expecting you.

261
00:16:09,812 --> 00:16:11,445
Even canceled my trip.

262
00:16:13,115 --> 00:16:14,416
Cookie?

263
00:16:15,503 --> 00:16:17,471
When I was a boy,

264
00:16:17,504 --> 00:16:20,206
I'd always take a cookie
when I had the chance.

265
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:25,378
You hired a man to kill Alfred.

266
00:16:25,413 --> 00:16:27,547
I hired your guardian's comrade

267
00:16:27,581 --> 00:16:28,948
to find out what you knew.

268
00:16:28,982 --> 00:16:31,985
I never intended harm to come to anyone.

269
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,389
I told the board you were a special case,

270
00:16:37,565 --> 00:16:38,790
that you need the talk

271
00:16:38,816 --> 00:16:40,056
early.

272
00:16:40,268 --> 00:16:41,971
The talk?

273
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:45,286
Bruce, when members of the
Wayne family reach a certain age,

274
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:48,023
some facts of life and
business are explained...

275
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:50,692
Wayne Enterprises is
committing serious crimes.

276
00:16:50,725 --> 00:16:52,793
Oh, my, yes.

277
00:16:52,827 --> 00:16:55,263
This is a multinational corporation

278
00:16:55,297 --> 00:16:57,698
operating in hundreds of jurisdictions.

279
00:16:58,254 --> 00:17:01,721
We do our best to subvert all
of them if it means profits.

280
00:17:02,081 --> 00:17:05,073
So... you admit it?

281
00:17:05,106 --> 00:17:06,708
Just like your father.

282
00:17:07,214 --> 00:17:10,545
He came in with his secret
files, demanding justice.

283
00:17:10,578 --> 00:17:11,880
At first.

284
00:17:12,457 --> 00:17:14,048
Then he changed his mind.

285
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:16,069
You're lying.

286
00:17:16,105 --> 00:17:17,404
Your father

287
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,761
came to understand the
reality of this business.

288
00:17:19,778 --> 00:17:21,278
As did his father.

289
00:17:21,313 --> 00:17:22,652
And as will you.

290
00:17:22,676 --> 00:17:24,536
My father was a good man.

291
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,029
You have an opportunity
to live a blessed life,

292
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:31,199
the life your father and mother

293
00:17:31,232 --> 00:17:33,634
wanted for you.

294
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:36,871
I beg you to reconsider.

295
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:40,040
Pardon me.

296
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,067
Lucius, come in.

297
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,018
Bruce Wayne,

298
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,557
meet one of our junior
executives, Lucius Fox.

299
00:17:46,582 --> 00:17:48,445
There's a public relations person out there

300
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,448
desperately searching for this young man.

301
00:17:50,481 --> 00:17:52,849
Then you'd best reunite them.

302
00:17:52,884 --> 00:17:54,919
Bruce,

303
00:17:54,952 --> 00:17:57,387
don't forget your cookie.

304
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:12,737
Now...

305
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,038
I'm going to tell you
something, and I'd appreciate

306
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:17,441
if you kept your face perfectly still.

307
00:18:17,476 --> 00:18:18,776
There's cameras everywhere.

308
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:20,377
I know because I put them there.

309
00:18:21,153 --> 00:18:23,647
What I'm about to say must be a deep secret

310
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:25,782
between you and me.

311
00:18:25,817 --> 00:18:28,152
I knew your father well.

312
00:18:28,185 --> 00:18:30,086
He was a good man.

313
00:18:30,122 --> 00:18:32,490
He wasn't the man the
company thought he was.

314
00:18:32,523 --> 00:18:35,660
I don't understand you.

315
00:18:35,693 --> 00:18:36,993
Bruce,

316
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:40,131
your father was a true Stoic.

317
00:18:40,164 --> 00:18:43,567
He kept his best self hidden.

318
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:46,336
That's all I'll say.

319
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,744
Good luck.

320
00:19:07,726 --> 00:19:09,259
Mr. Nygma?

321
00:19:09,294 --> 00:19:10,728
Ms. Kri...

322
00:19:10,761 --> 00:19:11,996
Ms. Kringle?

323
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:14,030
Would you open the door, please?

324
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:16,366
Um, I'm...

325
00:19:16,401 --> 00:19:18,102
One sec!

326
00:19:28,646 --> 00:19:31,449
I need the Hendricks case files.

327
00:19:31,482 --> 00:19:32,916
Um, yes. Hendricks.

328
00:19:32,951 --> 00:19:34,018
Wait right here.

329
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:38,355
Hendricks. Hendricks.

330
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,692
Hendricks, Hendricks, Hendricks, Hendricks.

331
00:19:41,727 --> 00:19:43,560
Hendricks, Hendricks, Hendricks.

332
00:19:43,595 --> 00:19:45,896
Oh, my goodness.

333
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:48,900
What happened to him? Um...

334
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:51,868
axe... uh, a-accidental death.

335
00:19:51,903 --> 00:19:53,637
Oh. At a sheet metal factory.

336
00:19:53,672 --> 00:19:55,405
Industrial saw. Just...

337
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,143
Poor man.

338
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:02,712
I... I don't know how you do this job.

339
00:20:02,748 --> 00:20:04,548
Death all around you.

340
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:05,782
Yes.

341
00:20:05,817 --> 00:20:08,318
One must have a sense of humor.

342
00:20:08,353 --> 00:20:10,887
The-the file?

343
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:12,155
Yes.

344
00:20:16,228 --> 00:20:19,196
Um, Mr. Nygma,

345
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,732
you haven't, by chance, seen,
uh, Tom... Officer Dougherty?

346
00:20:22,768 --> 00:20:26,237
We were... supposed to
have dinner last night.

347
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,371
He didn't show... no surprise...

348
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:28,905
Um, but I haven't seen him today.

349
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:31,108
Me neither.

350
00:20:31,143 --> 00:20:33,845
Oh.

351
00:20:33,878 --> 00:20:35,913
Excuse me. I really
need to get back to work.

352
00:20:35,948 --> 00:20:37,013
Oh, uh...

353
00:20:37,048 --> 00:20:38,215
- Uh...
- Now.

354
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,250
Okay. Um...

355
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:45,355
Oh, dear.

356
00:20:46,657 --> 00:20:49,527
You're sure...

357
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,261
the guns are there?

358
00:20:51,296 --> 00:20:53,816
Butch placed them himself.

359
00:20:53,832 --> 00:20:56,601
Do you remember what to say to
Maroni before you do the deed?

360
00:20:56,634 --> 00:21:00,070
I never saw the point in
telling a man something

361
00:21:00,105 --> 00:21:02,940
right before you're gonna whack him,

362
00:21:02,974 --> 00:21:06,309
but you're not the first to ask for it.

363
00:21:07,644 --> 00:21:09,846
I appreciate you humoring me.

364
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,817
So how do you know Maroni's
gonna be in this bar

365
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:14,652
on this exact day?

366
00:21:14,685 --> 00:21:16,686
I follow current events.

367
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:33,471
There he is.

368
00:21:33,505 --> 00:21:35,073
Tommy freakin' Bones.

369
00:21:35,106 --> 00:21:38,142
Nine years up the river,

370
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,177
and you get better-looking,
you big animal.

371
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:42,180
Took care of myself.

372
00:21:43,247 --> 00:21:44,885
I was hoping you'd remember.

373
00:21:44,911 --> 00:21:46,784
Come over here. Huh?

374
00:21:46,818 --> 00:21:50,253
Listen, you leave the joint,
you come to Lidia's for dinner.

375
00:21:50,288 --> 00:21:51,689
That's tradition.

376
00:21:51,723 --> 00:21:53,324
Welcome home. Lidia!

377
00:21:53,357 --> 00:21:54,625
Look who's here.

378
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,427
Ah...

379
00:22:09,741 --> 00:22:11,576
Welcome to the Foxglove.

380
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:12,690
The evening's entertainment

381
00:22:12,711 --> 00:22:14,345
is about to begin.

382
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,859
Then I guess I'm just in time.

383
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:11,169
Ladies and gentlemen,

384
00:23:11,202 --> 00:23:13,904
your attention, please.

385
00:23:13,939 --> 00:23:17,748
I know you have been
eagerly awaiting tonight's

386
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:19,007
main attraction.

387
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:22,599
So, please, let's give
a big Foxglove welcome

388
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,892
to Ingrid and Gareth.

389
00:23:35,794 --> 00:23:37,595
Oh, no.

390
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,063
Hell no.

391
00:23:40,465 --> 00:23:42,000
GCPD!

392
00:23:42,034 --> 00:23:44,001
Nobody move!

393
00:23:44,036 --> 00:23:46,170
Especially you two!

394
00:23:59,329 --> 00:24:00,997
Barbara?

395
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:05,434
Wake up, Barbara.

396
00:24:05,469 --> 00:24:07,303
Wake up.

397
00:24:12,604 --> 00:24:14,771
Shh, shh, shh. Come here.

398
00:24:17,548 --> 00:24:18,548
Don't cry.

399
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,883
Shh, shh, shh...

400
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,251
Hey.

401
00:24:23,953 --> 00:24:26,189
There's no need to cry.

402
00:24:26,222 --> 00:24:27,624
Okay?

403
00:24:29,993 --> 00:24:32,761
You're gonna kill me.

404
00:24:32,796 --> 00:24:34,130
Do you want me to?

405
00:24:34,163 --> 00:24:35,230
No!

406
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:39,201
Then tell me who to kill.

407
00:24:41,238 --> 00:24:42,872
Wh-What?

408
00:24:45,111 --> 00:24:46,945
You still don't believe I love you.

409
00:24:47,432 --> 00:24:48,566
You think I'm crazy.

410
00:24:49,318 --> 00:24:50,849
That's fine.

411
00:24:51,648 --> 00:24:53,449
I see the truth.

412
00:24:53,483 --> 00:24:55,617
I see your truth.

413
00:24:55,653 --> 00:24:57,987
I see that you've spent your whole life

414
00:24:58,021 --> 00:25:00,423
trying to kill it, but you can't...

415
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,125
It's too strong.

416
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,161
You revealed it to me the other night.

417
00:25:05,194 --> 00:25:08,364
I want to set that free.
I want to set you free.

418
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:11,334
You think that me making you murder someone

419
00:25:11,367 --> 00:25:13,435
will make me like you?

420
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,771
That's insane.

421
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:17,906
You say that

422
00:25:17,942 --> 00:25:21,443
because you don't know what
it is to live without fear.

423
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,680
But you'll learn.

424
00:25:25,115 --> 00:25:27,450
Now, tell me...

425
00:25:27,483 --> 00:25:30,053
who you want me to kill,

426
00:25:30,086 --> 00:25:31,820
or, though it breaks my heart,

427
00:25:31,855 --> 00:25:36,092
I will take your life right now.

428
00:25:38,095 --> 00:25:39,596
I can't.

429
00:25:41,932 --> 00:25:43,398
I... I can't.

430
00:25:44,734 --> 00:25:46,568
I... I can't.

431
00:25:47,605 --> 00:25:49,605
Tell me...

432
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,273
who... to kill.

433
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,824
You run this place?

434
00:26:08,945 --> 00:26:10,496
I'm looking for this man.

435
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,222
Arrest me if you want to; I
don't talk about my clients.

436
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:18,701
One call to the Gazette, they'll
send a reporter down here.

437
00:26:18,736 --> 00:26:20,936
I'll perp-walk each and
every one of your clients

438
00:26:20,971 --> 00:26:22,337
in front of the cameras.

439
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:24,641
How's that sound?

440
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:28,419
Talk to Sally.

441
00:26:32,116 --> 00:26:33,447
Do you know him?

442
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,215
You sure?

443
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,742
I'm sure.

444
00:26:47,935 --> 00:26:49,531
He said his name was Jason.

445
00:26:50,396 --> 00:26:51,867
He was sweet.

446
00:26:52,724 --> 00:26:55,704
As soon as I got into his car,
he pulled a hood over my head

447
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,016
and tied my wrists.

448
00:26:57,548 --> 00:26:58,907
He took me back to his apartment.

449
00:26:58,942 --> 00:27:01,144
That's where he did this.

450
00:27:01,971 --> 00:27:03,645
I don't know why he let me go.

451
00:27:03,681 --> 00:27:05,480
When was this?

452
00:27:05,516 --> 00:27:07,317
-Almost nine years ago.
- About a year before

453
00:27:07,351 --> 00:27:09,585
the first murder... He
was working his way up.

454
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:11,086
Why didn't you go to the police?

455
00:27:11,121 --> 00:27:12,387
I did.

456
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:15,191
I was a hooker; he was
a rich man with no name.

457
00:27:15,224 --> 00:27:17,259
Anything else you can tell us?

458
00:27:17,294 --> 00:27:19,561
Anything about his
apartment? The smallest detail

459
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,431
might help.

460
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,934
The elevator opened
right into the apartment.

461
00:27:26,837 --> 00:27:27,936
You can see out into the city.

462
00:27:27,971 --> 00:27:29,439
We were in midtown.

463
00:27:30,157 --> 00:27:31,907
And there was a big neon sign

464
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:34,422
on the building across the street.

465
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,511
I could only read the last four letters.

466
00:27:36,547 --> 00:27:38,614
O-Y-A-L.

467
00:27:38,648 --> 00:27:40,282
O-Y-A-L.

468
00:27:40,317 --> 00:27:42,285
Hmm. Loyal, royal...

469
00:27:42,318 --> 00:27:43,552
Royal.

470
00:27:43,586 --> 00:27:45,087
Gotham Royal Hotel.

471
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,756
That's in midtown. 10th and Gainsly.

472
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:48,090
Thank you, Sally.

473
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,625
Promise me, when you find him,

474
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,194
don't arrest him.

475
00:27:52,229 --> 00:27:53,596
Kill him.

476
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,865
You got it.

477
00:27:59,202 --> 00:28:01,537
Whoa, fellas, private party.

478
00:28:01,571 --> 00:28:03,405
Just here to pay respects.

479
00:28:04,143 --> 00:28:05,942
Connor from the wild northeast.

480
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,412
What's that old man Falcone want now?

481
00:28:09,445 --> 00:28:11,413
Don Falcone sends me with his respects,

482
00:28:11,448 --> 00:28:13,249
and a small gift for you

483
00:28:13,282 --> 00:28:15,084
and Tommy Bones on this happy day.

484
00:28:15,118 --> 00:28:16,285
Cheech.

485
00:28:18,288 --> 00:28:20,189
Forgive my suspicious nature.

486
00:28:20,223 --> 00:28:23,291
Of course. Can't be too careful.

487
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,496
Come here. Let me see this.

488
00:28:29,266 --> 00:28:31,067
Madre Di Dios.

489
00:28:31,101 --> 00:28:32,969
My favorite.

490
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:36,239
You tell Falcone I appreciate the gesture.

491
00:28:36,272 --> 00:28:37,952
Don Falcone knew it was a special occasion.

492
00:28:37,974 --> 00:28:39,608
We got time for a drink. Lidia!

493
00:28:39,643 --> 00:28:41,144
Clean glasses, please.

494
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,145
The gift comes with a message.

495
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,247
Oh, yeah?

496
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,148
What's that?

497
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,950
He wants you to know that it wasn't easy

498
00:28:47,984 --> 00:28:49,652
for him to decide to kill you.

499
00:28:52,662 --> 00:28:54,423
Son of a bitch.

500
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:57,359
But business is business.

501
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,436
You believe it?

502
00:29:07,471 --> 00:29:09,439
You both jammed.

503
00:29:09,472 --> 00:29:11,473
If that ain't a sign from
God, I don't know what.

504
00:29:11,508 --> 00:29:12,709
Please... Shut your mouth!

505
00:29:12,742 --> 00:29:13,742
Ow! You're gonna take

506
00:29:13,777 --> 00:29:15,111
Don Falcone a message from me.

507
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:18,624
You're gonna let him know that you messed up...

508
00:29:18,648 --> 00:29:21,116
and you're gonna let him
know that I'm coming for him.

509
00:29:21,151 --> 00:29:25,020
Of course, you don't need
to be alive to tell him that.

510
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:26,154
Tommy, do the honors.

511
00:29:26,884 --> 00:29:28,218
Wait...

512
00:29:45,763 --> 00:29:47,021
***

513
00:29:47,047 --> 00:29:49,047
Maroni's still alive

514
00:29:49,072 --> 00:29:51,072
This is flat!

515
00:29:52,463 --> 00:29:53,990
Did you not hear me?

516
00:29:54,016 --> 00:29:55,671
Maroni is still alive!

517
00:29:55,695 --> 00:29:58,046
You got to get out of town.

518
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,727
And miss all the fun?

519
00:30:00,942 --> 00:30:02,519
You knew.

520
00:30:03,075 --> 00:30:04,635
You set him up.

521
00:30:05,067 --> 00:30:08,933
I took the firing pins out of
the guns before you hid them.

522
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:11,426
A spin on a
trick I learned from Maroni.

523
00:30:13,262 --> 00:30:15,313
But you could have had Maroni dead.

524
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:19,596
True, but I still would've
been under Falcone's thumb,

525
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:22,686
and that... has grown intolerable.

526
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:26,080
No, I'd much rather Maroni be alive,

527
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,338
and out for blood.

528
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:38,802
Alas, Officer Dougherty, she's
gonna wonder where you went.

529
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:43,609
Perhaps a letter.

530
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:47,404
You could say good-bye,
give her some advice.

531
00:30:48,288 --> 00:30:50,256
Something that might lead her

532
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:53,259
to make better choices in the future, hmm?

533
00:31:32,031 --> 00:31:34,032
Jim?

534
00:31:35,868 --> 00:31:37,836
Place is empty.

535
00:31:37,871 --> 00:31:40,705
But there's something you should see.

536
00:31:45,344 --> 00:31:48,311
You see anything that connects to Barbara?

537
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:52,151
Maybe she was never here.

538
00:31:52,175 --> 00:31:54,080
No, she was here.

539
00:31:54,105 --> 00:31:55,940
I can still smell her perfume.

540
00:31:56,837 --> 00:31:59,376
Hey, we're gonna find this guy,

541
00:31:59,402 --> 00:32:01,882
but you need to prepare yourself...

542
00:32:03,511 --> 00:32:05,857
that we might not be in time to save her.

543
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:07,460
That is not an option.

544
00:32:07,484 --> 00:32:09,419
It's the most likely option.

545
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:25,173
Hello.

546
00:32:25,208 --> 00:32:27,142
Detective Gordon,

547
00:32:27,175 --> 00:32:29,243
I assume you are the one
who triggered the alarm.

548
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:30,979
You son of a bitch. Where's Barbara?

549
00:32:31,012 --> 00:32:34,281
With me, of course.

550
00:32:34,317 --> 00:32:35,683
If you've hurt her...

551
00:32:35,718 --> 00:32:37,551
She's as safe as milk.

552
00:32:37,586 --> 00:32:40,055
Safer than she ever was
when she was with you.

553
00:32:41,523 --> 00:32:43,290
What the hell does that mean?

554
00:32:43,326 --> 00:32:45,492
She doesn't need your protection, Jim.

555
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:47,729
Fact is, she never did.

556
00:32:47,762 --> 00:32:49,330
I'll see you around.

557
00:32:49,365 --> 00:32:51,365
Wait.

558
00:32:53,368 --> 00:32:54,501
He was driving.

559
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:56,270
To Tahiti if he's smart.

560
00:32:56,305 --> 00:32:57,838
Yeah, there was a noise, right?

561
00:32:57,874 --> 00:33:01,643
A thumping, like he
was going over a bridge.

562
00:33:01,676 --> 00:33:04,511
You know, I heard, uh, a
horn, like a train horn.

563
00:33:04,547 --> 00:33:06,513
Okay, so, which bridge has a train?

564
00:33:06,548 --> 00:33:08,349
Um...

565
00:33:08,384 --> 00:33:12,019
Damn. Um... Whitecross, but
that's the upstate train.

566
00:33:12,054 --> 00:33:14,689
Upstate.

567
00:33:14,723 --> 00:33:16,724
It's where her parents live.

568
00:33:24,034 --> 00:33:26,000
Barbara, please.

569
00:33:26,026 --> 00:33:27,992
What's happening?

570
00:33:28,018 --> 00:33:31,487
What's happening is your
daughter is finally waking up.

571
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:35,038
Please.

572
00:33:36,979 --> 00:33:39,447
Barbara, we're doing this for you.

573
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,340
Jim?

574
00:34:44,954 --> 00:34:46,536
Barbara.

575
00:34:47,257 --> 00:34:49,559
What are you doing here?

576
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,447
You're not supposed to be here.

577
00:35:14,507 --> 00:35:16,119
Where is he?

578
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:52,847
Drop it.

579
00:35:52,871 --> 00:35:55,057
Drop the knife, or I'll shoot.

580
00:35:55,092 --> 00:35:58,695
Just an ounce of pressure,
and she'll split right open.

581
00:35:58,728 --> 00:36:00,697
I don't want that. Do you want that?

582
00:36:00,731 --> 00:36:03,032
It's gonna be all right, Barbara.

583
00:36:03,067 --> 00:36:04,634
It's gonna be all right.

584
00:36:04,668 --> 00:36:06,668
If you cared about this woman,

585
00:36:06,704 --> 00:36:09,271
you never would have come after me.

586
00:36:09,306 --> 00:36:11,306
I love her more than you ever did.

587
00:36:11,342 --> 00:36:12,876
Drop the knife.

588
00:36:13,996 --> 00:36:16,378
Won't be me that slits her throat.

589
00:36:16,413 --> 00:36:18,815
Detective, that's gonna be you.

590
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:21,581
- Drop it.
- Jim, please.

591
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:24,721
Just leave us alone.

592
00:36:26,456 --> 00:36:29,025
Hey, jerk-o!

593
00:36:38,068 --> 00:36:39,268
Barbara?

594
00:36:39,302 --> 00:36:40,903
Barbara?

595
00:36:45,443 --> 00:36:46,443
He's dead?

596
00:36:46,443 --> 00:36:48,110
Yeah. He's dead.

597
00:36:48,144 --> 00:36:49,846
It's gonna be okay.

598
00:36:50,324 --> 00:36:53,460
Look at me. Barbara?

599
00:36:55,052 --> 00:36:56,619
It's gonna be okay.

600
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,402
Alfred, I never asked you.

601
00:37:12,436 --> 00:37:15,237
How was it yesterday, seeing Reggie?

602
00:37:15,271 --> 00:37:17,606
Not really, uh, an experience

603
00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:19,742
I'd care to repeat, Master Bruce.

604
00:37:21,268 --> 00:37:24,103
But then again, the Reggie
I knew died years ago.

605
00:37:28,184 --> 00:37:30,990
Alfred, I haven't been honest with you.

606
00:37:34,081 --> 00:37:36,349
After you were hurt,

607
00:37:36,626 --> 00:37:38,762
Selina and I went looking for Reggie.

608
00:37:41,409 --> 00:37:43,409
We found him.

609
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:46,835
Did you, now?

610
00:37:46,871 --> 00:37:48,565
He didn't jump

611
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:51,391
or fall.

612
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:53,809
Selina pushed him.

613
00:37:54,844 --> 00:37:57,447
And why did she do that?

614
00:37:58,371 --> 00:38:01,317
Reggie was sent here by a
man named Sid Bunderslaw.

615
00:38:01,628 --> 00:38:03,585
Bunderslaw works for Wayne Enterprises.

616
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,621
Reggie gave us the name,

617
00:38:05,655 --> 00:38:07,996
but said he was gonna tell
Bunderslaw what we were doing.

618
00:38:09,592 --> 00:38:12,661
I see.

619
00:38:12,697 --> 00:38:14,831
And the rest?

620
00:38:15,865 --> 00:38:17,460
The charity ball...

621
00:38:17,485 --> 00:38:19,786
Presumably to have
access to Mr. Bunderslaw.

622
00:38:20,764 --> 00:38:24,106
Selina stole the key to his office safe.

623
00:38:24,141 --> 00:38:26,809
I went there today. It was empty.

624
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,356
But Bunderslaw was waiting for me.

625
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,514
- What did he do?
- Nothing.

626
00:38:31,548 --> 00:38:33,759
- What did he do?!
- Nothing!

627
00:38:35,652 --> 00:38:37,989
But he said that my father and grandfather

628
00:38:38,014 --> 00:38:41,023
knew about the illegal things
that the company was doing,

629
00:38:41,057 --> 00:38:42,858
and chose...

630
00:38:42,893 --> 00:38:45,362
They chose to stay quiet.

631
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,570
Your father was a good man.

632
00:38:55,269 --> 00:38:57,271
I know.

633
00:38:59,382 --> 00:39:01,483
But even good men have secrets.

634
00:39:07,585 --> 00:39:09,585
There he is.

635
00:39:10,802 --> 00:39:13,065
- That guy right there.
- Yeah, nice work.

636
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,355
Yeah, nice work.

637
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,385
Congratulations. You're a hero.

638
00:39:16,409 --> 00:39:17,726
Yeah, it won't last.

639
00:39:17,762 --> 00:39:19,596
Tomorrow, they'll go back to hating me.

640
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,097
Well, then I'll remind them.

641
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:24,976
Yesterday, you were trying to help.

642
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:26,869
I couldn't hear it. I'm sorry.

643
00:39:26,903 --> 00:39:29,577
I would never try to change you, Jim.

644
00:39:29,603 --> 00:39:32,708
Your sense of mission... it's
part of what I love about you.

645
00:39:32,742 --> 00:39:35,445
I thought it was my devastating good looks.

646
00:39:35,478 --> 00:39:36,746
That's a joke.

647
00:39:40,784 --> 00:39:42,251
I was scared.

648
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:45,364
Scared that Barbara would get hurt

649
00:39:45,389 --> 00:39:48,125
and you would blame yourself
for protecting me first,

650
00:39:48,641 --> 00:39:51,443
and then whatever we had would die.

651
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:55,197
It wasn't heroic. It was selfish.

652
00:40:00,271 --> 00:40:01,972
Lee, I love you.

653
00:40:02,755 --> 00:40:04,139
Not her.

654
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:08,585
If I had to do it again,
I'd still protect you first.

655
00:40:14,684 --> 00:40:16,219
What did you do?

656
00:40:16,253 --> 00:40:19,422
Uh, grabbed a... knife by the blade.

657
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:21,891
Of course you did.

658
00:40:21,925 --> 00:40:23,259
Let me see.

659
00:40:29,532 --> 00:40:32,168
Miss Kringle?

660
00:40:32,202 --> 00:40:34,403
Are you okay?

661
00:40:36,088 --> 00:40:38,389
I got a letter from Officer Dougherty.

662
00:40:39,077 --> 00:40:40,943
He left town.

663
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:46,349
"Don't wait around for
me. Go have some fun,

664
00:40:46,384 --> 00:40:48,150
and maybe I'll give you
a call when I get back."

665
00:40:48,184 --> 00:40:49,318
Blah, blah, blah.

666
00:40:49,353 --> 00:40:51,476
Couldn't even tell me to my face.

667
00:40:51,735 --> 00:40:55,291
I mean, why do I keep picking creeps?

668
00:40:56,422 --> 00:40:59,547
Sometimes with men, you need
to read between the lines.

669
00:40:59,572 --> 00:41:02,766
Sometimes with men, you need a drink.

670
00:41:03,925 --> 00:41:05,927
Good day, Mr. Nygma.

671
00:41:11,387 --> 00:41:13,387
