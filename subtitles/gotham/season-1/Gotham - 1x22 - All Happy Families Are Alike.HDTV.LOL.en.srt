1
00:00:02,267 --> 00:00:04,268
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:06,058 --> 00:00:09,461
You haven't, by chance,
seen Officer Doughtery?

3
00:00:10,796 --> 00:00:12,163
We were supposed to have dinner last night,

4
00:00:12,198 --> 00:00:13,265
and he didn't show.

5
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:15,734
No surprise, um, but I
haven't seen him today.

6
00:00:15,768 --> 00:00:17,102
Me, neither.

7
00:00:17,136 --> 00:00:19,437
Barbara, we're doing this for you.

8
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,444
- He's dead?
- Yeah, he's dead.

9
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:27,946
It's gonna be okay.

10
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,615
Bruce, your father was a true stoic.

11
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,484
He kept his best self hidden.

12
00:00:32,518 --> 00:00:34,085
Your father was a good man.

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,288
But even good men have secrets.

14
00:00:36,322 --> 00:00:38,924
You have a hard head,
James, just like your father.

15
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:40,759
Gotham is on a knife edge,

16
00:00:40,793 --> 00:00:43,194
but I won't let it fall
apart without a fight.

17
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:45,063
Just got wind of
three separate attacks

18
00:00:45,097 --> 00:00:46,965
on Falcone businesses in
different parts of town.

19
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:49,668
It's Maroni. We're in shooting war.

20
00:01:14,894 --> 00:01:16,895
Whoa.

21
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,472
Good morning, child.

22
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,664
We ain't children,

23
00:01:31,699 --> 00:01:34,567
and... it ain't morning.

24
00:01:34,602 --> 00:01:36,970
Oh, it will be soon.

25
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,441
A brand-new day.

26
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,439
The gang
war rages on here in Gotham.

27
00:01:57,473 --> 00:01:59,941
No one knows what set
this bloody turf war off,

28
00:01:59,976 --> 00:02:02,110
but it is commonly
believed to be the result

29
00:02:02,145 --> 00:02:06,081
of the longtime power struggle
between Salvatore Maroni

30
00:02:06,115 --> 00:02:07,949
and Carmine Falcone.

31
00:02:07,984 --> 00:02:11,019
Longtime enemies, these men
have often come to blows...

32
00:02:16,592 --> 00:02:19,094
Still looking for secrets, are we, sir?

33
00:02:20,463 --> 00:02:22,431
Or just breaking stuff?

34
00:02:22,465 --> 00:02:24,466
Secrets.

35
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:26,301
I don't know.

36
00:02:27,704 --> 00:02:29,805
Whole city's going doolally around us.

37
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:34,242
I mean, there's a bloody
war on the streets...

38
00:02:34,277 --> 00:02:36,778
and you're in here worrying
about your poor old dad.

39
00:02:36,813 --> 00:02:38,947
Yes, I am.

40
00:02:38,981 --> 00:02:40,649
If your father had a secret life...

41
00:02:40,683 --> 00:02:42,317
Which I hasten to add, he didn't...

42
00:02:42,352 --> 00:02:43,719
I'd know about it, wouldn't I?

43
00:02:43,753 --> 00:02:46,221
A sober, diligent man he was.

44
00:02:46,255 --> 00:02:47,723
Never out gallivanting.

45
00:02:47,757 --> 00:02:49,992
Home every night, like clockwork,

46
00:02:50,026 --> 00:02:52,594
working, in this very room.

47
00:02:52,628 --> 00:02:54,496
Yes, I remember.

48
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,798
I wasn't allowed to disturb
him while he was working.

49
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,803
- Nobody was.
- Classical music...

50
00:02:59,841 --> 00:03:02,209
- he would play for hours.
- That's right.

51
00:03:02,243 --> 00:03:03,477
Mom and I would read books

52
00:03:03,511 --> 00:03:05,245
or play board games until he was done.

53
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:08,081
I remember.

54
00:03:08,116 --> 00:03:10,083
I tried to sneak in to see him,

55
00:03:10,118 --> 00:03:13,887
but the door was locked.

56
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:15,289
Was the door always locked, Alfred?

57
00:03:15,323 --> 00:03:17,991
Yeah, well, I suppose
so, when he was working.

58
00:03:18,026 --> 00:03:20,494
Why, though?

59
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:22,729
Why lock the door?

60
00:03:22,764 --> 00:03:24,731
That's what doors are for, isn't it?

61
00:03:24,766 --> 00:03:27,134
It's in here.

62
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:29,102
It's in this room.

63
00:03:29,137 --> 00:03:31,438
My father's secret, it's in this room.

64
00:03:31,472 --> 00:03:33,473
I know it.

65
00:03:33,508 --> 00:03:35,909
I know it!

66
00:03:35,944 --> 00:03:37,444
Uh...

67
00:03:37,478 --> 00:03:38,779
Oh!

68
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,100
Ah.

69
00:04:05,273 --> 00:04:07,374
Hello, young lady.

70
00:04:07,408 --> 00:04:10,477
I like your style.

71
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:28,592

72
00:04:29,564 --> 00:04:32,132
Hey, put Falcone's guys in one
cell, and Maroni's in another.

73
00:04:33,635 --> 00:04:34,801
Get in there!

74
00:04:38,506 --> 00:04:40,040
Get him!

75
00:04:40,074 --> 00:04:41,842
Get in there!

76
00:04:50,718 --> 00:04:52,819
Outside!

77
00:04:58,626 --> 00:05:00,360
Officer Katz, right?

78
00:05:00,395 --> 00:05:02,362
Yes, sir, Katz, Griffin.

79
00:05:02,397 --> 00:05:04,231
Word of advice, Katz.

80
00:05:04,265 --> 00:05:06,600
I'm a dead duck around here.

81
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:09,670
Brass are gonna fire me just as
soon as this gang war cools off.

82
00:05:09,704 --> 00:05:12,172
So don't salute me.

83
00:05:12,206 --> 00:05:14,207
Makes you look like a rube.

84
00:05:20,582 --> 00:05:23,016
Hi.

85
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:24,818
- Detective.
- Dr. Thompkins.

86
00:05:24,852 --> 00:05:26,053
Jim.

87
00:05:26,087 --> 00:05:28,088
Thanks for coming to see me.

88
00:05:28,122 --> 00:05:30,357
It's good to see you looking so well.

89
00:05:30,391 --> 00:05:31,758
I am well.

90
00:05:31,793 --> 00:05:33,193
Much better.

91
00:05:33,228 --> 00:05:34,761
Yes.

92
00:05:34,796 --> 00:05:36,797
You are. This is your last checkup.

93
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:38,298
You are all healed physically.

94
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,400
But you need to get some trauma counseling.

95
00:05:40,435 --> 00:05:43,237
Doc, I'm happy.

96
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:45,939
I am happy to be alive.

97
00:05:45,974 --> 00:05:49,309
Which is why, Jim, I didn't want to leave

98
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:51,411
without saying thank you properly.

99
00:05:52,914 --> 00:05:54,982
Thank you for saving my life.

100
00:05:56,117 --> 00:05:58,118
I was glad to do it.

101
00:05:59,287 --> 00:06:00,821
Miss Kean...

102
00:06:00,855 --> 00:06:03,056
trauma counseling, like, yesterday.

103
00:06:03,091 --> 00:06:04,958
I have several recommendations for you.

104
00:06:04,993 --> 00:06:07,661
- Really, Doc, I am fine.
- You're not fine.

105
00:06:07,695 --> 00:06:10,330
After what you've been
through, nobody would be fine.

106
00:06:10,365 --> 00:06:13,500
Fine. If you will be my counselor.

107
00:06:13,535 --> 00:06:16,937
And we do it at my place.

108
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:19,973
No. I have some trauma training,

109
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:22,109
but it's not my area of focus.

110
00:06:22,143 --> 00:06:23,343
I like you.

111
00:06:23,378 --> 00:06:25,279
Hey, I can talk to you.

112
00:06:25,313 --> 00:06:26,513
Please?

113
00:06:31,853 --> 00:06:33,820
Okay.

114
00:06:33,855 --> 00:06:35,455
Deal.

115
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,624
Thank you.

116
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:38,992
Hmm?

117
00:06:40,662 --> 00:06:42,496
All right, last warning to all of you!

118
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,431
Don't free that guy!

119
00:06:44,465 --> 00:06:46,333
Hey, Jim, did you hear the news?

120
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:47,801
Don Falcone just got hit.

121
00:06:47,835 --> 00:06:49,136
- Jim?
- What?!

122
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,138
Falcone got hit 20 minutes ago.

123
00:06:51,172 --> 00:06:52,506
Maroni's boys blew up his car.

124
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,007
- He's dead?
- No. He's at the hospital,

125
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:56,043
but he'll be dead soon enough.

126
00:06:56,077 --> 00:06:59,179
Listen, Essen said City Hall
and the bigwigs okayed the hit.

127
00:06:59,214 --> 00:07:01,114
They switched their support to Maroni.

128
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:03,116
Maroni? That hothead?

129
00:07:03,151 --> 00:07:04,551
They think he can run this city?

130
00:07:04,586 --> 00:07:05,786
Someone had to go.

131
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,021
This war has been bad for business.

132
00:07:08,056 --> 00:07:10,057
Hello?

133
00:07:27,976 --> 00:07:29,943
Hello?

134
00:07:29,978 --> 00:07:31,979
Hello!

135
00:07:57,605 --> 00:07:59,706
Good morning. Good morning.

136
00:07:59,741 --> 00:08:01,608
Oh, Penguin, thank God.

137
00:08:01,643 --> 00:08:03,410
Get me out of here.

138
00:08:03,444 --> 00:08:05,279
Maroni's men will be here any minute.

139
00:08:05,313 --> 00:08:07,281
Yes, I imagine so.

140
00:08:07,315 --> 00:08:09,116
Mustn't stay long.

141
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:13,287
But... I knew I'd regret it

142
00:08:13,321 --> 00:08:15,956
if I didn't say good-bye to you in person.

143
00:08:23,264 --> 00:08:25,299
It was me, old friend.

144
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:28,202
I did this to you.

145
00:08:31,973 --> 00:08:34,241
I started the war.

146
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:36,810
From the day I met you,
I was planning your end.

147
00:08:38,012 --> 00:08:40,714
I'm sorry it has to be in this...

148
00:08:40,748 --> 00:08:44,751
squalid little corner, but...

149
00:08:50,859 --> 00:08:53,727
c'est la vie.

150
00:08:53,761 --> 00:08:56,263
Why?

151
00:08:56,297 --> 00:08:59,833
Nothing personal, I assure you, sir.

152
00:08:59,868 --> 00:09:03,637
You have been a wise mentor

153
00:09:03,671 --> 00:09:06,707
and a good friend,

154
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:09,343
but...

155
00:09:09,377 --> 00:09:10,777
business must come first.

156
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:17,251
I'm gonna take your place, old man.

157
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:20,120
And I'm gonna be the
King of Gotham.

158
00:09:20,155 --> 00:09:22,256
You?

159
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,991
Never.

160
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:26,760
You're going to burn in Hell.

161
00:09:33,334 --> 00:09:35,536
I do worry about that.

162
00:09:37,572 --> 00:09:40,841
But you first,

163
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,277
old friend.

164
00:09:43,311 --> 00:09:46,847
You first.

165
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:48,448
Nobody move!

166
00:09:54,155 --> 00:09:57,391
- Walk away!
- Shut up.

167
00:09:57,425 --> 00:09:59,626
You're both under arrest
for attempted murder.

168
00:10:07,927 --> 00:10:10,061
Didn't you hear?

169
00:10:10,095 --> 00:10:11,996
Falcone is out by official decree.

170
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:13,231
Everyone agreed.

171
00:10:13,265 --> 00:10:14,499
I heard.

172
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:16,734
So, release me, Jim.

173
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:18,336
Get on the winning side.

174
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,732
Winning side, my ass.

175
00:10:20,783 --> 00:10:22,851
Maroni's a fool. He can't replace me.

176
00:10:22,885 --> 00:10:25,320
A thousand rivals will
jump up to challenge him.

177
00:10:25,355 --> 00:10:27,322
There'll be civil war.

178
00:10:27,357 --> 00:10:29,691
If I die now, Gotham falls apart.

179
00:10:29,726 --> 00:10:31,793
I agree, but can you turn things around?

180
00:10:31,828 --> 00:10:33,695
Can you take back control?

181
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,764
Of course.

182
00:10:35,798 --> 00:10:37,766
Two days at my safe house.

183
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,802
I need two days to make some moves,

184
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:44,306
and I'll skin Maroni and those
disloyal scum like rabbits.

185
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,841
Wake up, Napoleon!

186
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,943
Maroni's louts are minutes away

187
00:10:47,977 --> 00:10:50,212
from coming here and cutting your throat,

188
00:10:50,246 --> 00:10:52,547
and the thing is, Jim,
they aren't very fond

189
00:10:52,582 --> 00:10:55,317
of me, either, so, seriously,

190
00:10:55,351 --> 00:10:57,886
you need to uncuff me... Jim?!

191
00:11:06,362 --> 00:11:07,996
Jim, where the hell'd you run off to?

192
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:09,164
Harv,

193
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:10,832
I'm in the hospital with Falcone.

194
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:12,034
There's nobody here.

195
00:11:12,068 --> 00:11:14,236
No kidding. What the
hell are you doing there?

196
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,504
You gotta get out now.

197
00:11:15,538 --> 00:11:17,272
They'll be coming back to finish him off.

198
00:11:17,307 --> 00:11:19,975
Yeah. Any moment now.

199
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:21,743
Unless I get him out of here.

200
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:23,211
Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.

201
00:11:23,246 --> 00:11:26,682
- I could use some help.
- No way. Are you nuts?

202
00:11:26,716 --> 00:11:29,384
He's a bad man, but he's
the best bad man we got.

203
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:30,919
If Falcone loses control,

204
00:11:30,954 --> 00:11:33,488
Maroni's too wild to run Gotham.

205
00:11:33,523 --> 00:11:35,590
- There'll be anarchy.
- Yeah, probably,

206
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,326
but Falcone already lost control.

207
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,660
And he'll get it back.

208
00:11:38,695 --> 00:11:42,297
Listen, you're all twisted
over what happened to Barbara.

209
00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:43,999
You're not thinking straight.

210
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:46,335
Yeah. Maybe.

211
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:48,704
But I'm done in this town anyhow.

212
00:11:48,738 --> 00:11:52,107
- What do I have to lose?
- Your life. Huh?

213
00:11:52,141 --> 00:11:54,743
How 'bout your life?

214
00:11:59,616 --> 00:12:01,950
What the hell are you doing here?

215
00:12:01,985 --> 00:12:05,187
I thought the fix was in with you guys.

216
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:19,668
Can you walk?

217
00:12:19,702 --> 00:12:20,936
- If I have to.
- Let's get you

218
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,738
out of here... I'll take
you to your safe house.

219
00:12:22,772 --> 00:12:24,806
Jim, my friend,

220
00:12:24,841 --> 00:12:27,042
you are making a terrible mistake.

221
00:12:27,076 --> 00:12:29,111
I'm doing this for the city,

222
00:12:29,145 --> 00:12:30,279
not you.

223
00:12:30,313 --> 00:12:31,813
You're the least worst option.

224
00:12:31,848 --> 00:12:33,815
If I didn't think you
could take back control,

225
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,341
I'd let you die.

226
00:12:35,706 --> 00:12:38,487
- Just so we're clear.
- We're clear.

227
00:12:38,521 --> 00:12:40,489
You can't leave me here.

228
00:12:40,523 --> 00:12:42,324
Maroni's men will kill me!

229
00:12:42,358 --> 00:12:43,558
Possible.

230
00:12:43,593 --> 00:12:45,694
No. No, you-you arrested us.

231
00:12:45,728 --> 00:12:47,930
We are in your custody.

232
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:49,831
That's true.

233
00:12:49,866 --> 00:12:51,900
You owe me a favor, Jim.

234
00:12:51,935 --> 00:12:53,502
You owe me!

235
00:12:53,536 --> 00:12:55,103
Damn it.

236
00:12:55,138 --> 00:12:57,372
James Gordon!

237
00:12:58,841 --> 00:13:01,109
Detective Gordon!

238
00:13:13,056 --> 00:13:14,456
Don't kill 'em.

239
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:24,933
Morning, fellas.

240
00:13:24,968 --> 00:13:26,401
What can I help you with?

241
00:13:26,436 --> 00:13:27,936
Yes, Gordon.

242
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:30,272
As usual, wrong place, wrong time.

243
00:13:30,306 --> 00:13:32,174
Go. Now.

244
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:35,510
Why? So these men can kill Carmine Falcone?

245
00:13:35,545 --> 00:13:37,846
I have no knowledge of that.

246
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,847
Go.

247
00:13:38,881 --> 00:13:40,616
That's an order.

248
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,951
You're a disgrace, Loeb.

249
00:13:42,986 --> 00:13:46,255
I hope to see you behind bars very soon.

250
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:47,923
Or dead.

251
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:49,458
Whichever.

252
00:13:49,492 --> 00:13:53,462
Hope.

253
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:55,163
It's for losers...

254
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:57,199
Jim.

255
00:14:01,037 --> 00:14:04,039
He's all yours!

256
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,785
Get him!

257
00:14:20,356 --> 00:14:22,424
Move, move, move, move.

258
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,397
Aah!

259
00:15:10,873 --> 00:15:12,207
Jim! Jim! Don't shoot! It's me!

260
00:15:12,242 --> 00:15:15,043
We gotta go... there are
ambulances in the basement.

261
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:16,445
Where's your man?

262
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,447
Uh...

263
00:15:18,481 --> 00:15:20,616
about that.

264
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,951
We got to take Penguin and Gilzean, too.

265
00:15:22,986 --> 00:15:24,319
- Penguin and Gilzean?
- I arrested 'em

266
00:15:24,354 --> 00:15:26,088
for attempted murder.
They're in my custody.

267
00:15:26,122 --> 00:15:27,823
I don't even
want to argue with you.

268
00:15:27,857 --> 00:15:29,892
Come on! Let's go! Go!

269
00:15:29,926 --> 00:15:32,561
Tommy... Tommy!

270
00:15:35,298 --> 00:15:36,999
Boss! Boss! Look out!

271
00:15:39,302 --> 00:15:40,469
Get down!

272
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:56,952
Damn it.

273
00:16:07,696 --> 00:16:09,029
What exactly

274
00:16:09,064 --> 00:16:10,664
are we looking for, Master Bruce?

275
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:14,602
When I find it, I'll know.

276
00:16:33,054 --> 00:16:35,189
Nobody knows about this
place, right? Nobody?

277
00:16:35,223 --> 00:16:37,625
Nobody. Anybody who did is dead.

278
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:40,060
We'll be safe here.

279
00:16:44,499 --> 00:16:46,000
Hello.

280
00:16:48,203 --> 00:16:50,504
What's up?

281
00:17:00,782 --> 00:17:03,817
I know, I know.

282
00:17:03,852 --> 00:17:05,819
It's astonishing.

283
00:17:05,854 --> 00:17:09,023
Sometimes I astonish myself.

284
00:17:12,986 --> 00:17:15,888
I feel like, uh,

285
00:17:15,923 --> 00:17:17,890
this is all a dream,

286
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:20,093
and I'm gonna wake up soon.

287
00:17:23,997 --> 00:17:26,299
Barbara,

288
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,368
you were abducted.

289
00:17:28,402 --> 00:17:31,337
Your parents were killed in front of you.

290
00:17:31,372 --> 00:17:33,373
Yeah. Yeah, that's real.

291
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:39,779
I'm talking about this. Now. This...

292
00:17:39,813 --> 00:17:41,814
this is the dream.

293
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:44,217
I'm gonna wake up

294
00:17:44,251 --> 00:17:45,885
and...

295
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,888
he's still alive...

296
00:17:48,922 --> 00:17:51,924
and he's coming for me.

297
00:17:56,397 --> 00:17:59,298
I thought for sure you were dead.

298
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,301
Let me look at you.

299
00:18:02,336 --> 00:18:04,003
Fish?

300
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:10,176
Is it real... It's really you?

301
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:14,080
It's... it's me, Butch. I'm home.

302
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:19,018
My poor baby. What did they do to you?

303
00:18:20,721 --> 00:18:22,355
Nothing good.

304
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,358
It's him, boss.

305
00:18:29,263 --> 00:18:32,231
Don Maroni.

306
00:18:33,934 --> 00:18:35,368
Yes.

307
00:18:35,402 --> 00:18:38,371
Alive and well.

308
00:18:38,405 --> 00:18:41,841
That's a long story.

309
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,876
We need to talk.

310
00:18:44,878 --> 00:18:48,348
I have something you want.

311
00:18:53,721 --> 00:18:56,723
They didn't find my knife.

312
00:18:57,758 --> 00:18:59,726
Ah.

313
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,861
So we're saved then.

314
00:19:01,895 --> 00:19:03,663
It's in my sock.

315
00:19:03,697 --> 00:19:05,932
If you get the chance,
take some of them with us.

316
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:07,433
I'll try.

317
00:19:07,468 --> 00:19:09,435
Hey, you.

318
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,404
Selina, what are you doing here?

319
00:19:11,438 --> 00:19:14,040
Chillin'. How 'bout you?

320
00:19:14,074 --> 00:19:15,541
Kind of jammed up.

321
00:19:15,576 --> 00:19:16,943
Yeah.

322
00:19:16,977 --> 00:19:19,379
That's too bad.

323
00:19:24,351 --> 00:19:26,252
Oh...

324
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:28,287
that's mime for "help us out here."

325
00:19:28,322 --> 00:19:29,789
- Eh.
- And totally blow

326
00:19:29,823 --> 00:19:33,259
the coolest gig ever just because we kinda,

327
00:19:33,294 --> 00:19:35,928
sorta know each other?

328
00:19:35,963 --> 00:19:37,297
Right?

329
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,101
Hello, fellas.

330
00:19:42,136 --> 00:19:45,505
Hmm. Carmine.

331
00:19:48,142 --> 00:19:49,976
Penguin.

332
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,745
Nothing to share?

333
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,647
Well, I have a little something.

334
00:19:54,682 --> 00:19:59,118
I just made a sweet deal with Maroni.

335
00:19:59,153 --> 00:20:02,455
He just told me I could
have all my territories back,

336
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:04,424
and all I have to do in return...

337
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:08,795
is give him Carmine's head.

338
00:20:10,397 --> 00:20:14,033
Uh, Fish, I-I need to go lie down.

339
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:19,872
What did you do to that
poor soul, you sadist?

340
00:20:19,907 --> 00:20:21,441
I assure you...

341
00:20:22,543 --> 00:20:24,177
You will die

342
00:20:24,211 --> 00:20:28,681
a slow, painful death on account of Butch.

343
00:20:28,716 --> 00:20:30,183
You, too, Carmine.

344
00:20:32,486 --> 00:20:34,187
You...

345
00:20:36,156 --> 00:20:38,691
We'll keep it simple.

346
00:20:40,094 --> 00:20:42,228
And you?

347
00:20:42,263 --> 00:20:44,631
We're cool.

348
00:20:44,665 --> 00:20:46,199
Any questions?

349
00:20:47,534 --> 00:20:48,868
How you gonna kill 'em?

350
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:56,576
I love this girl.

351
00:21:04,312 --> 00:21:06,471
Jason saw right through me.

352
00:21:06,534 --> 00:21:09,102
He knew me instantly.

353
00:21:09,136 --> 00:21:10,971
Like I was naked.

354
00:21:11,005 --> 00:21:13,306
It was scary...

355
00:21:13,341 --> 00:21:15,141
but thrilling.

356
00:21:15,176 --> 00:21:16,643
And...

357
00:21:16,677 --> 00:21:18,578
aren't...

358
00:21:18,613 --> 00:21:20,847
all the best guys

359
00:21:20,882 --> 00:21:23,016
a little scary?

360
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,851
I was

361
00:21:24,886 --> 00:21:28,788
way more scared of Jim Gordon
the first date we went on.

362
00:21:28,823 --> 00:21:31,992
So butch and...

363
00:21:32,026 --> 00:21:33,894
stern.

364
00:21:33,928 --> 00:21:36,163
That type, they-they often

365
00:21:36,197 --> 00:21:38,165
have a bad temper.

366
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:41,434
Hmm. But Jim was a sweetie.

367
00:21:41,469 --> 00:21:43,637
Never laid a finger on me.

368
00:21:43,671 --> 00:21:47,541
It was kind of surprising.

369
00:21:47,575 --> 00:21:48,909
Does he ever hit you?

370
00:21:48,943 --> 00:21:51,812
Me? No. Why?

371
00:21:51,846 --> 00:21:53,513
Wh-Why would he hit anyone?

372
00:21:53,548 --> 00:21:54,648
Any woman?

373
00:21:54,682 --> 00:21:56,583
You know.

374
00:21:56,617 --> 00:21:58,485
Out of passion.

375
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:04,524
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry.

376
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,693
Only I heard you and Jim were dating.

377
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:08,995
No.

378
00:22:11,699 --> 00:22:13,900
Y-Yes, we've been on a few dates.

379
00:22:13,935 --> 00:22:16,169
I'm sorry, I didn't think that you knew.

380
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:18,672
If that makes you
uncomfortable in any way...

381
00:22:18,706 --> 00:22:21,441
No. Don't be silly.

382
00:22:21,475 --> 00:22:23,777
I, uh... I'm happy for you.

383
00:22:23,811 --> 00:22:26,713
He's one of the good guys.

384
00:22:26,747 --> 00:22:29,449
Yeah, he is.

385
00:22:29,483 --> 00:22:31,084
Hey, you hungry?

386
00:22:41,128 --> 00:22:43,263
So, there he is.

387
00:22:43,297 --> 00:22:47,868
Fish, you
mysterious, crazy, gorgeous

388
00:22:47,902 --> 00:22:49,069
killer, you.

389
00:22:49,103 --> 00:22:50,403
I love ya.

390
00:22:50,438 --> 00:22:51,705
Come here.

391
00:22:54,842 --> 00:22:56,476
This...

392
00:22:56,511 --> 00:22:59,045
this is delicious.

393
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,647
Finally.

394
00:23:00,681 --> 00:23:03,750
- You're hard to kill, old man.
- No.

395
00:23:03,784 --> 00:23:05,919
Your people are second-rate.

396
00:23:08,456 --> 00:23:10,123
Miss Mooney,
if I may, a brief word.

397
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:12,459
I know my life is forfeit.

398
00:23:12,493 --> 00:23:15,762
I speak not for my sake, but yours.

399
00:23:15,796 --> 00:23:16,997
Because...

400
00:23:17,031 --> 00:23:18,632
after all,

401
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:20,467
I still love and respect you.

402
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:23,270
Kill me if you must,

403
00:23:23,304 --> 00:23:26,006
but keep Falcone alive.

404
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,642
As soon as he's dead,
Maroni has no use for you.

405
00:23:28,676 --> 00:23:30,944
You are simply a threat. He will kill you.

406
00:23:30,978 --> 00:23:32,412
Oh!

407
00:23:32,446 --> 00:23:34,114
You think?

408
00:23:34,148 --> 00:23:36,449
Why would he need another boss in town?

409
00:23:36,484 --> 00:23:37,684
Another rival?

410
00:23:37,718 --> 00:23:38,985
That's where you're wrong, smart guy.

411
00:23:40,321 --> 00:23:41,855
She's not a rival,

412
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:43,590
because she's not a boss.

413
00:23:43,624 --> 00:23:44,925
She's an underboss.

414
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:47,727
An underboss takes orders.

415
00:23:47,762 --> 00:23:49,763
I don't take orders.

416
00:23:49,797 --> 00:23:51,531
- I know that.
- We're cool.

417
00:23:51,566 --> 00:23:52,933
Relax.

418
00:23:53,968 --> 00:23:55,602
I'm relaxed.

419
00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:57,204
I don't think you are, babes.

420
00:24:00,074 --> 00:24:02,842
Please don't call me babes.

421
00:24:02,877 --> 00:24:04,044
You see?

422
00:24:04,078 --> 00:24:06,446
Not relaxed.

423
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,516
Babes? Really?

424
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:12,052
It's a term of endearment.

425
00:24:12,086 --> 00:24:14,221
It means I like you.

426
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:18,124
Fine. I misspoke.

427
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,801
You're not an underboss
and you're not a babe.

428
00:24:21,116 --> 00:24:23,730
You tell me what you are.

429
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:27,801
What we are, Sal...

430
00:24:29,537 --> 00:24:31,538
are partners.

431
00:24:31,572 --> 00:24:33,506
Whatever you want.

432
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:35,775
Partners.

433
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,078
I'm partner number one,

434
00:24:38,112 --> 00:24:40,180
and you're partner number two.

435
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:42,816
That's the deal, right?

436
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,951
I'm number one...

437
00:24:44,986 --> 00:24:47,053
and you are...?

438
00:24:50,124 --> 00:24:51,758
Number two.

439
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:53,894
There you go. Simple math.

440
00:24:53,928 --> 00:24:56,663
One, two, babes. Oops.

441
00:24:56,697 --> 00:24:58,732
Sorry.

442
00:24:58,766 --> 00:25:01,201
That's the last time. I swear.

443
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:08,108
Guys!

444
00:25:08,142 --> 00:25:10,777
Can you feel the buzz in the air?

445
00:25:10,811 --> 00:25:13,179
That's victory.

446
00:25:13,214 --> 00:25:14,614
Redemption.

447
00:25:14,649 --> 00:25:16,750
Power!

448
00:25:16,784 --> 00:25:18,451
When this old man dies,

449
00:25:18,486 --> 00:25:20,920
a new day begins.

450
00:25:20,955 --> 00:25:23,390
We will rule Gotham.

451
00:25:23,424 --> 00:25:25,692
We are building a dynasty.

452
00:25:25,726 --> 00:25:28,962
We will whip this town

453
00:25:28,996 --> 00:25:31,765
like a rented mule.

454
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,566
Right, babes?

455
00:25:35,469 --> 00:25:37,837
Oh-ho, just... all right, relax.

456
00:25:37,872 --> 00:25:39,406
I'm kidding you.

457
00:25:40,975 --> 00:25:42,976
Guys, no, seriously.

458
00:25:43,978 --> 00:25:45,946
Don't call her "babes."

459
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,882
Or "toots" or what have you.

460
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:50,583
It's a woman's lib thing.

461
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:56,957
I am relaxed.

462
00:26:11,105 --> 00:26:12,105
Let's go!

463
00:26:23,071 --> 00:26:25,206
Barbara, we've been
circling around the subject,

464
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,210
but haven't talked about
what actually happened to you;

465
00:26:29,244 --> 00:26:31,378
wh-what was done to you.

466
00:26:31,413 --> 00:26:32,646
Lee...

467
00:26:32,681 --> 00:26:34,682
you're a nice lady.

468
00:26:36,451 --> 00:26:37,885
I could go there,

469
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,554
but I'm not sure you
want to go there with me.

470
00:26:40,589 --> 00:26:42,690
Don't worry about me.

471
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:53,612
Has Jim told you he loves you?

472
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:55,413
- Barbara...
- Fair is fair.

473
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:57,649
I'm telling you all my little secrets.

474
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:00,452
No, he hasn't.

475
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:03,622
But he will, though, won't he?

476
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:05,657
You can feel it coming?

477
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:07,525
I mean, come on, look at you.

478
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,029
You're gorgeous and smart...
Of course he loves you.

479
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:12,364
Do you love him?

480
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:14,432
Barbara...

481
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,304
Tell me what happened.

482
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:29,681
If we can get to 7th
Avenue without being spotted

483
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:31,683
by Fisher's people, we're home free.

484
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:34,786
- Then what?
- We find a safe place, regroup.

485
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,955
Maroni's death is a lucky break for you.

486
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,057
Spoken like a true mafioso.

487
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:41,459
You're the least worst
option, like you said.

488
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:43,428
Without you, the city falls apart.

489
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:46,564
Yes, I said that, and it might be true,

490
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,366
but this has been a long day

491
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:50,001
and I've had a long time

492
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:51,703
to look at this world I've created.

493
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:53,772
I'm done with this business.

494
00:27:53,806 --> 00:27:55,173
I'm out.

495
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:57,509
I've got a place down south I can go to.

496
00:27:57,543 --> 00:28:00,378
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

497
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:02,814
I know. I'm letting you down.

498
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:05,150
I'm letting the city down. I know.

499
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:07,986
Hey, I heard something.

500
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,088
Yeah, flash it this way.

501
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:12,657
Down here, down here!

502
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:15,627
Okay, plan B.

503
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:27,572
Keep the light up.

504
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:34,279
So you got a place down south, huh?

505
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:36,047
Nice? On the water?

506
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:37,716
Yes.

507
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,718
Any work for beat-up old cops?

508
00:28:39,752 --> 00:28:41,052
Sure.

509
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:42,687
How's that sound, Jim?

510
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:44,623
Beaches, sunshine, fishing...

511
00:28:44,657 --> 00:28:46,191
Yeah, tempting.

512
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,593
Hello again.

513
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,631
Cat got your tongue?

514
00:28:58,638 --> 00:29:00,472
Yes!

515
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:05,944
Selena.

516
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:07,712
Boys.

517
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:09,781
Bless you.

518
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:11,449
Got to hand it to you, Fish.

519
00:29:11,484 --> 00:29:14,252
You really know how to stop a
show. I couldn't help myself,

520
00:29:14,287 --> 00:29:16,888
Harvey, the man vexed me.

521
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,490
Crazy move.

522
00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:20,825
Possibly a good move, too. We'll see.

523
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,028
The battlefield is in flux.

524
00:29:23,062 --> 00:29:25,880
You could be looking at
the new Queen of Gotham.

525
00:29:25,918 --> 00:29:28,519
Congratulations, my dear.

526
00:29:28,554 --> 00:29:29,787
I'm quitting, Fish.

527
00:29:29,821 --> 00:29:31,355
I'm out.

528
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,124
Does this mean I don't have to kill you?

529
00:29:33,158 --> 00:29:35,359
You're gonna retire

530
00:29:35,394 --> 00:29:37,328
someplace warm, lay back,

531
00:29:37,362 --> 00:29:39,196
read your little funny papers?

532
00:29:39,231 --> 00:29:41,365
- That was the thought.
- Yeah.

533
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,967
Nice thought.

534
00:29:56,782 --> 00:29:57,782
Fish!

535
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,987
Please, no.

536
00:30:04,857 --> 00:30:06,657
Fish!

537
00:30:06,692 --> 00:30:08,759
Where are you?!

538
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:16,000
Go!

539
00:30:36,321 --> 00:30:38,956
Then he left me.

540
00:30:38,991 --> 00:30:41,526
For a long time.

541
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,928
Alone.

542
00:30:43,962 --> 00:30:46,464
And I slept.

543
00:30:46,498 --> 00:30:48,533
I don't know for how long.

544
00:30:48,567 --> 00:30:51,502
And then he woke me up.

545
00:30:51,537 --> 00:30:54,605
Road trip, he said.

546
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,864
We were halfway there when...

547
00:30:58,944 --> 00:31:01,045
I realized...

548
00:31:04,316 --> 00:31:06,450
we were going to my parents' house.

549
00:31:07,486 --> 00:31:09,887
Go on.

550
00:31:09,922 --> 00:31:13,191
Well, then he tied them up to a chair...

551
00:31:14,993 --> 00:31:16,661
and, uh...

552
00:31:16,695 --> 00:31:20,565
he told me to talk to them...

553
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:22,733
about my childhood issues.

554
00:31:22,768 --> 00:31:24,502
So I did.

555
00:31:24,536 --> 00:31:25,736
I...

556
00:31:25,771 --> 00:31:29,540
just... told them
whatever came into my head.

557
00:31:29,575 --> 00:31:32,376
And what came into your head?

558
00:31:32,411 --> 00:31:33,878
You know...

559
00:31:33,912 --> 00:31:36,547
just stupid kid stuff, I guess,

560
00:31:36,582 --> 00:31:39,250
like, uh...

561
00:31:39,284 --> 00:31:42,753
my mom used to call me her
little piggy when I was little.

562
00:31:42,788 --> 00:31:45,423
They threw away my posters.

563
00:31:45,457 --> 00:31:48,392
Never nurtured my self-esteem.

564
00:31:48,427 --> 00:31:50,761
Just slowly...

565
00:31:50,796 --> 00:31:53,931
steadily...

566
00:31:53,966 --> 00:31:56,801
grinding away at my soul.

567
00:31:58,904 --> 00:32:01,639
Trying to make me...

568
00:32:01,673 --> 00:32:03,207
disappear.

569
00:32:04,243 --> 00:32:07,011
That's not kid stuff.

570
00:32:07,045 --> 00:32:10,781
To be fair to them...

571
00:32:10,816 --> 00:32:13,451
they simply never understood me.

572
00:32:15,053 --> 00:32:17,788
They have no clue

573
00:32:17,823 --> 00:32:20,358
who I am.

574
00:32:21,393 --> 00:32:23,895
Even when I was killing them,

575
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:25,696
they just gaped at me...

576
00:32:25,731 --> 00:32:27,765
like fools.

577
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,635
No understanding.

578
00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:32,670
Barbara...

579
00:32:32,704 --> 00:32:34,839
Jason Lennon killed your parents.

580
00:32:34,873 --> 00:32:36,774
You didn't kill them.

581
00:32:38,777 --> 00:32:40,478
Yes, I did.

582
00:32:42,948 --> 00:32:44,916
I stabbed them...

583
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:47,919
several times...

584
00:32:47,953 --> 00:32:50,288
and then I slit their throats.

585
00:32:59,366 --> 00:33:00,733
I'd like to leave now, please.

586
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:02,267
You uncomfortable?

587
00:33:03,803 --> 00:33:05,070
How about now?

588
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,100
Damn.

589
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:06,109
Aah!

590
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,629
Lee.

591
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:29,406
She... She just... She just went crazy.

592
00:34:33,385 --> 00:34:35,239
Told him that woman was trouble.

593
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,705
Aah!

594
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,020
Butch.

595
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,655
About time.

596
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,924
- Shoot her, Butch.
- Oh, really?

597
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:30,561
Do as I say, Butch. Shoot her.

598
00:35:32,605 --> 00:35:35,073
What are you doing? Drop him.

599
00:35:35,107 --> 00:35:37,409
My friend,

600
00:35:37,443 --> 00:35:38,777
remember your training.

601
00:35:38,811 --> 00:35:40,712
- I order you to shoot her!
- Aah!

602
00:35:40,746 --> 00:35:42,147
Butch!

603
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,216
Don't listen to him. He
did something to your mind.

604
00:35:45,251 --> 00:35:46,684
I'm your girl.

605
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:48,586
Remember, I'm your girl.

606
00:35:48,621 --> 00:35:49,921
Kill her now!

607
00:35:52,091 --> 00:35:53,625
Oh!

608
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:55,393
Aah! Oh.

609
00:35:58,631 --> 00:36:00,365
Butch...

610
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:01,966
Oh, my God, what did I do?

611
00:36:03,936 --> 00:36:05,070
I'm so sorry.

612
00:36:05,104 --> 00:36:06,571
I'm so sorry, I would never hurt you.

613
00:36:06,605 --> 00:36:09,407
- I love you, Fish.
- It's okay.

614
00:36:09,442 --> 00:36:11,476
It's not your fault. I love you too.

615
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,144
He messed with your mind.

616
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:14,479
It's not your fault.

617
00:36:14,513 --> 00:36:16,314
I'm gonna be fine.

618
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:17,782
You know me.

619
00:36:17,817 --> 00:36:20,685
Aah!

620
00:36:24,657 --> 00:36:26,591
Good-bye, Fish.

621
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:28,960
It's all good.

622
00:36:32,431 --> 00:36:33,665
No!

623
00:36:47,313 --> 00:36:50,515
I'm the King of Gotham.

624
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,354
I'm the King of Gotham!

625
00:36:58,391 --> 00:37:00,825
I'm the King of Gotham!

626
00:37:04,296 --> 00:37:07,699
Mr. Nygma.

627
00:37:07,733 --> 00:37:09,034
Miss Kringle.

628
00:37:12,038 --> 00:37:14,539
I just noticed something really weird.

629
00:37:14,573 --> 00:37:16,574
Oh?

630
00:37:21,047 --> 00:37:23,915
This note Officer Dougherty left for me...

631
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:26,885
The first letter of every
line spells out your name.

632
00:37:29,555 --> 00:37:30,822
You see?

633
00:37:30,856 --> 00:37:33,725
N, Y...

634
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:36,628
G...

635
00:37:36,662 --> 00:37:39,030
M, A.

636
00:37:39,065 --> 00:37:40,699
Yes.

637
00:37:40,733 --> 00:37:43,101
How, that... How-How odd.

638
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:47,105
What-What a... What
an amazing coincidence.

639
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:50,442
- Coincidence?
- What else could it be?

640
00:37:52,511 --> 00:37:54,379
So you know nothing about this?

641
00:37:54,413 --> 00:37:55,680
I... Me? No.

642
00:37:55,715 --> 00:37:57,182
No.

643
00:37:57,216 --> 00:38:00,752
No.

644
00:38:00,786 --> 00:38:02,921
Huh.

645
00:38:23,442 --> 00:38:25,477
You're the
guy that likes riddles.

646
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,579
Why are you laughing,
you fool? It's not funny.

647
00:38:27,613 --> 00:38:29,447
What a creep.

648
00:38:29,482 --> 00:38:31,816
She'll keep digging.

649
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,219
Why did you have to leave a clue? Why?

650
00:38:34,253 --> 00:38:36,721
Relax.

651
00:38:36,756 --> 00:38:39,057
What can she find? What can she prove?

652
00:38:39,091 --> 00:38:41,159
Nothing. There's no body. Stop worrying.

653
00:38:43,262 --> 00:38:44,496
But she looks so sad and angry.

654
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,131
I hate it when she looks at me that way.

655
00:38:46,165 --> 00:38:47,165
Menacing and weird.

656
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,267
- Please.
- Like it matters,

657
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:51,002
like you stand a chance with her.

658
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,470
She knows how you feel about her and she

659
00:38:52,505 --> 00:38:54,339
treats you like dirt. Treats you like dirt.

660
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,841
I don't care, I still love her.

661
00:38:56,876 --> 00:39:00,178
Oh, listen to yourself. Be a man!

662
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,149
You'll do better with that one
if she's a little scared of you.

663
00:39:04,183 --> 00:39:06,351
- Stop talking like that.
- No riddles.

664
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,920
- Formal complaints about you.
-  Just keeping it real.

665
00:39:08,954 --> 00:39:11,022
What's black and white
and red all over? Stop it!

666
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,124
I wouldn't quit
your day job if I were you.

667
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,969
- He is... so weird.
- So... so...

668
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,950
Beautiful, huh?

669
00:39:38,984 --> 00:39:41,164
I'm gonna miss this town.

670
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:42,954
You won't change your mind?

671
00:39:44,657 --> 00:39:47,358
- The town needs you.
- No.

672
00:39:47,393 --> 00:39:51,396
Gotham needs a lawman now.
Not a criminal like me.

673
00:39:52,998 --> 00:39:54,699
A strong lawman.

674
00:39:57,837 --> 00:39:59,304
You looking at me?

675
00:39:59,338 --> 00:40:02,574
Someone needs to grab this city
by the neck and shake it hard.

676
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,576
That's you, Jim.

677
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,245
I know it in my bones.

678
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,747
There's a lot of powerful men

679
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,015
who would disagree with you on that.

680
00:40:16,188 --> 00:40:18,189
Nice knife, huh?

681
00:40:25,698 --> 00:40:27,232
That was your father's.

682
00:40:27,266 --> 00:40:29,934
He gave it to me a long time ago.

683
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,170
A spur-of-the-moment
birthday gift.

684
00:40:32,204 --> 00:40:33,705
I said no.

685
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:35,507
Such a beautiful knife,

686
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:38,510
and I have men with guns to protect me.

687
00:40:38,544 --> 00:40:40,412
He said take it.

688
00:40:40,446 --> 00:40:43,415
A knife is a good friend
when you have no other.

689
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:46,584
You were that close.

690
00:40:47,753 --> 00:40:49,421
At one time.

691
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,861
The point of the story, Jim...

692
00:40:56,896 --> 00:41:00,165
Your father was the most
honest man I ever met.

693
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:03,268
But he carried a knife.

694
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,584
Enough searching, Master B.

695
00:41:19,618 --> 00:41:21,619
There's nothing here.

696
00:41:24,757 --> 00:41:26,257
Now, your father was a good man,

697
00:41:26,292 --> 00:41:28,393
a flawed man, like anyone else.

698
00:41:28,427 --> 00:41:29,961
Doesn't mean he had a secret life.

699
00:41:29,995 --> 00:41:32,230
My intuition's nearly always correct.

700
00:41:32,264 --> 00:41:34,132
Yeah, well.

701
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:36,801
It's a common delusion, I find.

702
00:41:38,471 --> 00:41:41,573
Arkham's full of men whose
intuitions are always correct.

703
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:44,976
There are none so blind.

704
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,450
None so blind.

705
00:41:53,953 --> 00:41:56,354
Marcus Aurelius. Marcus Aurelius!

706
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,822
What about him?

707
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,192
He was a Roman emperor.

708
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,495
Yes, well, I'm fully aware
of that, Master Bruce.

709
00:42:03,529 --> 00:42:05,897
And a stoic. I think I
remember he was a stoic,

710
00:42:05,931 --> 00:42:09,000
like my father.

711
00:42:09,034 --> 00:42:11,536
Lucius Fox called my father a stoic.

712
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,973
Lots of people are called stoic.

713
00:42:15,007 --> 00:42:16,975
Basically means a
hardnut. Doesn't say much.

714
00:42:17,009 --> 00:42:18,543
Doesn't mean it's a bloody clue, does it?

715
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:21,980
It's a philosophy,
Alfred. It's a way of life.

716
00:42:22,014 --> 00:42:25,683
Maybe... Maybe that as
well, I suppose, but...

717
00:42:28,654 --> 00:42:29,621
Ah!

718
00:42:29,655 --> 00:42:30,855
Oh...

719
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,964
What is it, do you think?

720
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,166
I don't know and I don't care,

721
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,567
and don't you dare
press that bloody button.

722
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:45,637
Why not? It could be a bomb.

723
00:42:45,671 --> 00:42:48,072
Alfred, that seems improbable.

724
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,714
It's a stereo.

725
