1
00:00:03,047 --> 00:00:05,076
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:05,266 --> 00:00:06,678
Told you, easy as pie.

3
00:00:06,868 --> 00:00:08,513
- What?
- Sorry, Frankie.

4
00:00:08,703 --> 00:00:10,715
Arnold Flass,

5
00:00:10,905 --> 00:00:12,517
you're under arrest for
the murder of Leon Winkler.

6
00:00:12,707 --> 00:00:14,352
You really think these guys
are gonna let you arrest me?

7
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:15,720
Shut up, Flass.

8
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,289
Penguin, come here.

9
00:00:17,479 --> 00:00:19,391
You're a smart monkey.
But I'm the zookeeper.

10
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:21,259
I didn't think
it was going to be you,

11
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:23,094
my dear. You can come out now.

12
00:00:23,284 --> 00:00:24,763
Right as usual, my friend.

13
00:00:27,755 --> 00:00:29,267
- We got to go!
- I swear, Butch,

14
00:00:29,457 --> 00:00:36,007
I'm gonna come back and kill Penguin.

15
00:01:11,432 --> 00:01:12,877
Oh, no, please.

16
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:14,613
Don't, don't, please, please!

17
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:50,115
Ah.

18
00:01:50,305 --> 00:01:51,850
You're sure, now?

19
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,852
Fish Mooney is done.

20
00:01:54,042 --> 00:01:56,021
She tried to bring down Falcone.

21
00:01:56,211 --> 00:01:57,522
She failed.

22
00:01:57,712 --> 00:02:00,158
Last time I saw her, Victor
Zsasz had her cornered.

23
00:02:00,348 --> 00:02:01,559
We can assume she's either

24
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:04,062
dead or extremely unwell.

25
00:02:04,252 --> 00:02:07,098
Well, then. Salud.

26
00:02:07,288 --> 00:02:10,735
Mmm. You know, this creates
some intriguing opportunities.

27
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:13,538
Falcone will struggle to
hold on to her territories.

28
00:02:13,728 --> 00:02:14,873
If we move quickly...

29
00:02:15,063 --> 00:02:16,508
My thinking exactly.

30
00:02:16,698 --> 00:02:17,509
In fact,

31
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:20,412
I took the liberty of
claiming her nightclub.

32
00:02:20,602 --> 00:02:23,214
In your name, of course.

33
00:02:23,404 --> 00:02:26,184
You did, huh?

34
00:02:26,374 --> 00:02:28,887
Good thinking.

35
00:02:29,077 --> 00:02:31,156
A bird in the hand is
nine-tenths of the law, right?

36
00:02:31,346 --> 00:02:33,892
Yeah. Yeah.

37
00:02:34,082 --> 00:02:36,361
Phone for you, boss.

38
00:02:36,551 --> 00:02:37,629
Speak.

39
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:41,299
Hello, Sal.

40
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:42,767
Hey.

41
00:02:42,957 --> 00:02:44,603
You sound surprised.

42
00:02:44,793 --> 00:02:46,471
Let me guess... Your little friend Penguin

43
00:02:46,661 --> 00:02:47,739
told you I was dead.

44
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:48,873
As good as.

45
00:02:49,063 --> 00:02:52,844
Mm. I'm just on a vacation for a while.

46
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:54,913
- Huh.
- I'm not going to lie,

47
00:02:55,103 --> 00:02:57,148
I thought I was gonna end up on top.

48
00:02:57,338 --> 00:02:58,650
Instead, I got played.

49
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,154
Turns out, Penguin has been
Falcone's man the whole time.

50
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:05,624
They played us both for suckers.

51
00:03:05,814 --> 00:03:07,092
Is that right?

52
00:03:07,282 --> 00:03:08,760
Ah, indeed.

53
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,796
He told me himself, right
before I was about to gut him.

54
00:03:11,986 --> 00:03:13,965
You understand why I might be skeptical,

55
00:03:14,155 --> 00:03:15,467
considering it's you telling me this.

56
00:03:15,657 --> 00:03:17,469
Oh, wake up, dummy.

57
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:18,803
You mean to tell me this whole time

58
00:03:18,993 --> 00:03:20,906
you haven't suspected anything?

59
00:03:21,096 --> 00:03:23,942
That he hasn't made one slip
that he's had to explain away?

60
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:27,846
Or maybe even you wanted
to believe his lies.

61
00:03:28,036 --> 00:03:29,848
But it still gnaws at you, doesn't it?

62
00:03:30,038 --> 00:03:31,850
The doubt.

63
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,519
It's right there. A smudge.

64
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:35,987
Don't let it happen again.

65
00:03:36,177 --> 00:03:38,356
Maybe a couple of times.

66
00:03:38,546 --> 00:03:40,992
It's time to get your
house in order, Salvatore.

67
00:03:41,182 --> 00:03:44,362
And remember who put you wise.

68
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,169
Not bad news, I hope.

69
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:53,538
Nah. I got to go upstate.

70
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,540
See a guy about a thing.

71
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,042
Come with me.

72
00:03:57,232 --> 00:03:59,044
We can talk about opportunities.

73
00:03:59,234 --> 00:04:02,180
Sure.

74
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,149
- Just, uh, let me run home and...
- Bup, bup.

75
00:04:04,339 --> 00:04:07,018
We got to go now. Right now.

76
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,888
Super.

77
00:04:10,078 --> 00:04:12,624
I love a road trip. Yay.

78
00:04:12,814 --> 00:04:17,529
Yay.

79
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:22,334
Harvey?

80
00:04:22,524 --> 00:04:24,236
Captain.

81
00:04:24,426 --> 00:04:25,370
What have we got?

82
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,671
Sometime last night, Mr. Lucky there

83
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:29,374
got tied to that chair, noose
was dropped over his neck

84
00:04:29,564 --> 00:04:30,809
and he's heaved over the side.

85
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:32,978
Some suits coming up for a
smoke this morning found him.

86
00:04:33,168 --> 00:04:34,479
How'd he get back up to the roof?

87
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:35,647
See that pulley there?

88
00:04:35,837 --> 00:04:38,517
My guess: it was the killer.

89
00:04:38,707 --> 00:04:40,552
Guy went to a lot of
trouble to get him back up.

90
00:04:40,742 --> 00:04:42,020
Why not just leave him hanging?

91
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,188
Morning, Captain.

92
00:04:43,378 --> 00:04:45,357
- Morning, Ed.
- The more you cut me

93
00:04:45,547 --> 00:04:46,858
the bigger I grow. What am I?

94
00:04:47,048 --> 00:04:48,093
We're on a rooftop, Nygma.

95
00:04:48,283 --> 00:04:49,094
Don't tempt me.

96
00:04:49,284 --> 00:04:50,896
A hole. I'm a hole.

97
00:04:51,086 --> 00:04:51,897
Okay.

98
00:04:52,087 --> 00:04:52,964
Relevance?

99
00:04:53,154 --> 00:04:54,466
There's a hole, a surgical incision

100
00:04:54,656 --> 00:04:55,600
in our victim's abdomen.

101
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,536
Certainly postmortem.

102
00:04:57,726 --> 00:04:59,738
My guess: killer was looking for something.

103
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:01,673
I'll have to examine the body
more fully back at the lab.

104
00:05:01,863 --> 00:05:03,241
You mean the medical examiner will.

105
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:04,242
Well, but...

106
00:05:04,432 --> 00:05:05,744
You handle forensics, Ed.

107
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:07,579
The bodies belong to Dr. Guerra.

108
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:09,714
And he's made formal complaints.

109
00:05:09,904 --> 00:05:11,917
I can't cover for you anymore.

110
00:05:12,107 --> 00:05:13,618
I read you, ma'am.

111
00:05:13,808 --> 00:05:17,088
Loud and clear.

112
00:05:17,278 --> 00:05:18,757
So where's Gordon?

113
00:05:18,947 --> 00:05:20,592
Personal stuff. He'll be in soon.

114
00:05:20,782 --> 00:05:23,528
Hey, don't stand so near the edge.

115
00:05:23,718 --> 00:05:24,930
You worried about me, Captain?

116
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,599
You know I don't start drinking till noon.

117
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:28,867
I got to spell it out for you?

118
00:05:29,057 --> 00:05:30,902
Detective Flass had a lot of friends,

119
00:05:31,092 --> 00:05:33,205
and your partner arrested him for murder.

120
00:05:33,395 --> 00:05:34,773
Accidents happen.

121
00:05:34,963 --> 00:05:36,074
You put the cuffs on him.

122
00:05:36,264 --> 00:05:44,683
So we should all be careful.

123
00:05:44,873 --> 00:06:04,503
To hell with them.

124
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:43,542
Barbara?

125
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:45,610
Hi.

126
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,812
Let go of me.

127
00:06:47,002 --> 00:06:47,946
How long you been here?

128
00:06:48,136 --> 00:06:49,948
Just last night.

129
00:06:50,138 --> 00:06:51,683
And a couple times before.

130
00:06:51,873 --> 00:06:53,919
I knew your girlfriend was gone,

131
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:55,988
and I heard you got sent
to guard that loony bin,

132
00:06:56,178 --> 00:06:58,156
so I figured better here
than sleeping on the street.

133
00:06:58,346 --> 00:07:01,259
- Have you seen Barbara?
- No.

134
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:03,528
Oh, so things are over
between you two, huh?

135
00:07:03,718 --> 00:07:04,963
Sure you should be here then?

136
00:07:05,153 --> 00:07:06,631
Maybe you're the one breaking in.

137
00:07:06,821 --> 00:07:08,800
Came by to drop off
keys. Go get your stuff.

138
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,936
- Why? Where are you taking me?
- Well, you're not staying here,

139
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:12,337
and you're not gonna stay on the street.

140
00:07:12,527 --> 00:07:13,772
I'll find you someplace safe.

141
00:07:13,962 --> 00:07:16,575
Hmm. Safe.

142
00:07:16,765 --> 00:07:19,911
Safe like Wayne Manor?

143
00:07:20,101 --> 00:07:22,014
That was your last great idea.

144
00:07:22,204 --> 00:07:23,815
So someplace else.

145
00:07:24,005 --> 00:07:25,884
You're still my only
witness to the Wayne murders.

146
00:07:26,074 --> 00:07:27,586
Hmm.

147
00:07:27,776 --> 00:07:30,122
You haven't talked to
Bruce since he got back?

148
00:07:30,312 --> 00:07:33,325
- No. Why?
- Because I told him already.

149
00:07:33,515 --> 00:07:38,664
I didn't see anything. I lied.

150
00:07:38,854 --> 00:07:40,766
Sucks about your girlfriend.

151
00:07:40,956 --> 00:07:42,034
She's got some really nice stuff.

152
00:07:42,224 --> 00:07:43,568
Hey, wait!

153
00:07:43,758 --> 00:08:03,129
Stop!

154
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:06,529
Detective James Gordon
to see you, Master Bruce.

155
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:07,864
Detective.

156
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:13,670
Bruce, how are you?

157
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,639
I'm fine, thank you.

158
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,107
I would've come by earlier,

159
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,009
but things were a little crazy.

160
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,878
You were gone for a while.

161
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,546
Switzerland.

162
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:24,747
Probably wise.

163
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,649
I saw Selina Kyle.

164
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,251
She told me she lied.

165
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,352
She saw nothing.

166
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,420
Yes.

167
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,888
That's what she told me.

168
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,157
She made up the story to get out of juvie.

169
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,893
She could be saying this
now because she's scared.

170
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,895
It would be understandable
after what happened.

171
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,530
No.

172
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,765
She doesn't scare easily.

173
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,534
I believe her.

174
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:51,574
She didn't see the killer.

175
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,443
Look, this is unfortunate,

176
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,379
but it doesn't mean
we're back to square one.

177
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,581
Someone sent assassins after her.

178
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,550
Only a guilty person would do that.

179
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,788
Yes, and led her bloody
assassins to the manor.

180
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,556
Thank you very much.

181
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,959
Anyway, you need no longer
concern yourself with the case.

182
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,729
Bruce, this isn't the time to give up.

183
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,097
I'm not giving up.

184
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,266
I don't understand.

185
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:17,534
Months ago, you promised you'd find

186
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,469
who killed my parents,
and in all that time,

187
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,737
you've managed to find one witness,

188
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,640
who turned out to be a liar.

189
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,276
An investigation like this takes time.

190
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:29,179
I understand, but I don't
want you to feel bound

191
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:32,081
by an oath you can't fulfill.

192
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:35,618
I'm releasing you from your promise.

193
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:39,589
I'll pursue the matter on my own.

194
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,124
Bruce.

195
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,560
Yeah, no, I really wouldn't
bother, actually, mate.

196
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,096
Once Master Bruce makes up his mind,

197
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:47,897
there's no arguing with him.

198
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,767
He can't pursue this case on his own.

199
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,001
It's too dangerous.

200
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,971
Then I'll have to look after him.

201
00:09:55,161 --> 00:10:02,145
Can I show you the door?

202
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,147
Hey, sleepy head.

203
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,448
We're here.

204
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,251
You smell that air?

205
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:14,023
That's country air.

206
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:15,625
Let's get some chow.

207
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,865
Chow.

208
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:28,805
Excellent.

209
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,344
So where's the guy?

210
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:36,012
Which guy?

211
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,847
The guy with the thing.

212
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,282
Oh, he'll be along.

213
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,384
You don't like the coffee?

214
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:42,786
I like the coffee.

215
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,288
How about the oatmeal?

216
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,689
Also delicious.

217
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,191
It's good to get out of the city, huh?

218
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:51,194
Away from the fumes, the noise.

219
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,229
I can finally hear myself think.

220
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,065
It's all so...

221
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:58,134
simple and clean and honest out here.

222
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,304
Fresh air, oatmeal,

223
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,572
good friends.

224
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,240
How true. In Gotham,

225
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,242
we never have any time to connect,

226
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:07,711
to reflect.

227
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:09,646
- You feel that?
- Absolutely.

228
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,215
Mm.

229
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:15,585
This guy with the thing...

230
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,554
What is the thing?

231
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:18,922
Stop worrying about that guy.

232
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:20,724
You know what I was thinking about?

233
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,125
This is crazy.

234
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,127
Indian Hill.

235
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:27,831
You know, that dump in Arkham
that I traded to Falcone

236
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,232
for your neck.

237
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,967
How could I forget?

238
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,902
I'm eternally grateful.

239
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,772
You suggested it, whispered it in my ear.

240
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:38,541
It's worthless land.

241
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,410
But was it so worthless?

242
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,680
I mean, Falcone snapped it up pretty quick.

243
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,048
It was a token.

244
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:48,051
He simply needed to save
face. After Nikolai died...

245
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,686
Ah, see, you wouldn't believe it.

246
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,721
That's the other thing
I was thinking about.

247
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,591
The fight with Nikolai
when Frankie was killed.

248
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:57,594
What was he stabbed, like, ten times?

249
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,929
I don't recall the exact number.

250
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,898
Only, it was a gunfight.

251
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:06,102
How'd Frankie get killed with a knife?

252
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,038
That always kind of bugged me.

253
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,305
Honestly,

254
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,841
I'm not much use when things get physical.

255
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,910
I'm sorry I couldn't save him.

256
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,445
I was just reminiscing.

257
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,947
Don't beat yourself up about it.

258
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,383
We all got our talents, right?

259
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,452
Yes, we do.

260
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:25,422
Me...

261
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,124
I'm deceptively quick for a big guy.

262
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,794
Yes, you are.

263
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,232
I'm gonna go get some air.

264
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,269
Wait for the guy with the thing, hmm?

265
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:48,411
The guy. Right.

266
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,521
How about getting
it right the first time

267
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,490
so we don't have to keep doing this?

268
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,958
Detective Bullock?

269
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,194
It's my name. Don't wear it out.

270
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:05,261
I'm Scottie Mullens.

271
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,997
You called me about Adam Jodowsky.

272
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:09,532
Oh... Oh, Miss Mullens, yes.

273
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,167
Thank you for stopping by.

274
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,603
- Uh, Miss? Mrs.?
- Miss.

275
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,705
Good. Good. Please.

276
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,540
So...

277
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,710
how did you know Mr. Jodowsky?

278
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,279
I was his sponsor, sort of.

279
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,683
We're... we're in a support group together.

280
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:28,151
He's dead, isn't he?

281
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,153
Why would you say that?

282
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:33,723
This is a homicide division.
You're a homicide detective.

283
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:36,860
We found his body this morning.

284
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,296
Your number was in his pocket.

285
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,298
I'd just given it to him.

286
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,466
I recently started being his sponsor.

287
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,868
Mm-hmm.

288
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:46,870
So, uh, what kind of group is this?

289
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,872
Uh, for booze, pills?

290
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:50,807
It's for people suffering from phobias.

291
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,676
You're joking. Fear can be debilitating.

292
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:55,211
It helps to talk to someone about it.

293
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,680
Don't be an ass.

294
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,882
- Excuse me?
- You were about to make fun.

295
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,383
Don't be an ass.

296
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,585
You're right. I'm sorry. I was.

297
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,220
No fun-making. Please.

298
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,756
Um...

299
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,592
what was Mr. Jodowsky's phobia?

300
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,861
Heights.

301
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,531
Hmm. So if he was found dangling

302
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,533
from the top of a tall building...

303
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,835
Oh, my God. Is that how he... ?

304
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,871
I'm gonna need the names of all
the people in the support group.

305
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,273
It's completely anonymous.

306
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,041
Adam was the only one I knew personally.

307
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:28,244
You don't think someone
from the group did this?

308
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:32,382
Could be. Killer certainly
seemed to know of his phobia.

309
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:35,485
Are you Irish?

310
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:37,387
Y-You seem like you could be Irish.

311
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:40,190
- What's it to you?
- I'm just curious.

312
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,926
- When's the next meeting?
- Tonight, 6:00.

313
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,094
And these things...

314
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:45,695
They usually run, what, an hour?

315
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,098
- Mm-hmm.
- So,

316
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:52,902
you could maybe go to dinner afterwards.

317
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,604
Hypothetically.

318
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:56,873
Hypothetically.

319
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,742
Okay, well, I'm gonna
keep working the case,

320
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:05,048
and I'm gonna call you if I feel
the need to go to this meeting.

321
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,851
We're gonna find who did this.

322
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,753
I promise, Miss Mullens.

323
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:15,659
Okay.

324
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:18,228
So I went through the
materials from the scene.

325
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,398
Ropes and pulleys can be bought anywhere.

326
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,633
For what it's worth,
I, uh, traced the chair

327
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:25,468
the victim was tied to.

328
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,270
Yeah. I'm listening.

329
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,473
Banker's chair, wooden, made
by some company in the Narrows

330
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,075
that's been closed down for years.

331
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,276
Great. Let's go.

332
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,312
You sure? That's a pretty thin lead, Harv.

333
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:45,055
Since when have you been
scared of a little work, huh?

334
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:16,720
What was he after?

335
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,632
Well, now.

336
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,204
There! See? I told you!

337
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:35,238
Oh.

338
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:36,339
Oh, dear.

339
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:40,043
Get your hand out of that corpse.

340
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,511
Now.

341
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:44,047
I was just passing by, and I, um,

342
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,182
uh... I was... I was just curious.

343
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,184
What was I thinking?

344
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,087
I... Sorry. Won't happen again. Promise.

345
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:52,922
Do something about this or
I'm going over your head.

346
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,158
I'm the medical examiner!

347
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,361
Not this gibbering loon!

348
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:01,364
I'm sorry, Ed.

349
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,433
Till further notice, you're suspended.

350
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:10,507
Finally.

351
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:16,913
But I found something.

352
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:19,282
So, word around the house is that

353
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:21,451
you and Doc Caliente have a thing.

354
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,019
Thompkins?

355
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,788
Yeah, kind of. I guess.

356
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:27,023
So you and Barbara are finally finito?

357
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,558
Yeah.

358
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:31,261
Dropped the keys off
at her apartment today.

359
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:34,030
Get any of that righteous breakup sex?

360
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,398
She wasn't there.

361
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,767
You notice I don't ask
you about your love life?

362
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:40,437
My love life is an open book
and a short and nasty one.

363
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:41,805
But I'm working on the vic's friend

364
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:44,140
in the phobia support group,
and unless she's the killer,

365
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,810
- I think I'm in there.
- You see why I don't ask?

366
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,145
Don't screw it up with the doctor.

367
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:50,313
I'll try not to.

368
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,616
Seriously, been willing
to forgive you on account

369
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:54,417
of you're not getting laid,
but you mean to tell me

370
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:55,952
this whole time you've
been making speeches,

371
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:57,988
raising hell, you've had a woman?

372
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:00,457
The thought of what you would do if alone

373
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:02,058
is truly terrifying.

374
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:10,734
GCPD!

375
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:16,706
Drop the knife!

376
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:19,743
What the hell?

377
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:36,831
Thin lead, huh?

378
00:18:43,462 --> 00:18:46,309
Come in.

379
00:18:46,499 --> 00:18:49,646
I hope everything is to
your satisfaction, ma'am.

380
00:18:49,836 --> 00:18:52,015
It is. Thank you, Captain.

381
00:18:52,205 --> 00:18:53,683
You can see

382
00:18:53,873 --> 00:18:56,452
Gotham on the horizon if
you want to say good-bye.

383
00:18:56,642 --> 00:18:59,222
No need. I'll be back soon enough.

384
00:18:59,412 --> 00:19:00,423
Well...

385
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:03,026
if you need anything, just let me know.

386
00:19:03,216 --> 00:19:12,302
I will.

387
00:19:12,492 --> 00:19:14,304
This lucky fellow and the previous victim

388
00:19:14,494 --> 00:19:16,506
are both part of the
same phobia support group.

389
00:19:16,696 --> 00:19:18,341
Pigs. Go figure.

390
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:19,642
How is he?

391
00:19:19,832 --> 00:19:21,411
He's at Gotham General,
scared half to death.

392
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:22,645
The medics had to sedate him.

393
00:19:22,835 --> 00:19:24,647
The man you shot... Was
he in this group, too?

394
00:19:24,837 --> 00:19:27,283
Nope. No I.D. as yet.
We're running his prints.

395
00:19:27,473 --> 00:19:29,285
So is he our man or are we
still looking for someone else?

396
00:19:29,475 --> 00:19:31,054
- Hard to say.
- He's our man.

397
00:19:31,244 --> 00:19:32,455
These sort of wackos work alone.

398
00:19:32,645 --> 00:19:34,857
I'm gonna run by the support group,

399
00:19:35,047 --> 00:19:35,892
tell them it's been settled.

400
00:19:36,082 --> 00:19:36,893
Hey, we don't know that yet.

401
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:40,663
You need to be more optimistic.

402
00:19:40,853 --> 00:19:42,398
You do. You need to be more optimistic.

403
00:19:42,588 --> 00:19:44,838
We have a perp.

404
00:19:45,028 --> 00:19:48,308
The postmortem incision on
the first victim is weird.

405
00:19:48,498 --> 00:19:50,577
The killer was after
something. I want to know what.

406
00:19:50,767 --> 00:19:52,245
I'm gonna ask Nygma to take a look.

407
00:19:52,435 --> 00:19:56,249
No. He's been suspended.

408
00:19:56,439 --> 00:19:58,151
You got the report from the M.E.

409
00:19:58,341 --> 00:20:00,387
The same M.E. who said my
last witness stabbed himself

410
00:20:00,577 --> 00:20:02,155
to death in the back with an ice pick?

411
00:20:02,345 --> 00:20:03,890
No. No, thanks. Nygma...

412
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,894
Is not the medical examiner.

413
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:09,529
I like him, too.

414
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:12,566
But there's nothing I can do,
not with the way things are.

415
00:20:12,756 --> 00:20:14,601
What do you mean?

416
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,436
Look, I'm glad we took down Flass,

417
00:20:16,626 --> 00:20:19,673
but there are people you go
after and people you don't.

418
00:20:19,863 --> 00:20:22,075
So now everything we do is being watched.

419
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:25,445
You got the bad guy. Let it go.

420
00:20:25,635 --> 00:20:27,714
I'm sorry you got dragged into it.

421
00:20:27,904 --> 00:20:30,050
Don't be.

422
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,485
Felt good.

423
00:20:31,675 --> 00:20:36,656
Did, didn't it?

424
00:20:43,253 --> 00:20:45,899
Miss Kringle, I came to tell you that I...

425
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:48,235
Have you been crying?

426
00:20:48,425 --> 00:20:49,870
No, no. I'm-I'm fine.

427
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,872
But I can see tears on your face.

428
00:20:52,062 --> 00:20:54,808
Is it because your friend
Detective Flass was arrested?

429
00:20:54,998 --> 00:20:56,710
What do you need, Mr. Nygma?

430
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,512
Yes.

431
00:20:58,702 --> 00:21:02,082
I've been suspended and
won't be seeing you anymore.

432
00:21:02,272 --> 00:21:03,884
So I wanted to return this pencil.

433
00:21:04,074 --> 00:21:05,919
I took it from your office some time ago.

434
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:07,721
I kept meaning to return it.

435
00:21:07,911 --> 00:21:12,926
Used to be longer.

436
00:21:13,116 --> 00:21:17,230
You're an odd man, Mr. Nygma.

437
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,033
But I'm sorry that you've been suspended.

438
00:21:20,223 --> 00:22:02,042
I wish something could be done.

439
00:22:02,232 --> 00:22:11,351
Have a seat. We got to talk.

440
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,787
I feel that the time has
come in our relationship

441
00:22:13,977 --> 00:22:17,791
when we should have trust with each other.

442
00:22:17,981 --> 00:22:21,361
Real trust.

443
00:22:21,551 --> 00:22:24,798
Total honesty between us.

444
00:22:24,988 --> 00:22:26,366
No secrets.

445
00:22:26,556 --> 00:22:29,002
I 100% agree.

446
00:22:29,192 --> 00:22:32,372
So here's a secret to start off.

447
00:22:32,562 --> 00:22:35,175
There is no guy with a thing. I lied.

448
00:22:35,365 --> 00:22:37,544
I was beginning to wonder about him.

449
00:22:37,734 --> 00:22:39,079
Now you.

450
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:41,014
- Me?
- We're being honest.

451
00:22:41,204 --> 00:22:43,717
You have to tell me a secret in return.

452
00:22:43,907 --> 00:22:47,187
Secrets from you, Don Maroni?

453
00:22:47,377 --> 00:22:48,488
I have none.

454
00:22:48,678 --> 00:22:50,357
Please.

455
00:22:50,547 --> 00:22:52,592
Um...

456
00:22:52,782 --> 00:22:56,196
Honestly... I don't really like oatmeal.

457
00:22:56,386 --> 00:22:57,597
Good to know.

458
00:22:57,787 --> 00:22:59,032
See, I like this game.

459
00:22:59,222 --> 00:23:02,102
I'll tell you another secret.

460
00:23:02,292 --> 00:23:03,670
Fish Mooney's alive.

461
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,173
I spoke to her.

462
00:23:06,363 --> 00:23:08,875
Good secret, huh?

463
00:23:09,065 --> 00:23:11,745
- What did Fish say?
- Oh, no.

464
00:23:11,935 --> 00:23:13,513
You have to tell me a secret first.

465
00:23:13,703 --> 00:23:15,182
That's how it works.

466
00:23:15,372 --> 00:23:18,418
I don't much like coffee either.

467
00:23:18,608 --> 00:23:19,519
Fair enough.

468
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:21,855
What did Fish say?

469
00:23:22,045 --> 00:23:26,593
Said you and Falcone have been
working together all this time.

470
00:23:26,783 --> 00:23:28,929
She said you've been playing me

471
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:32,265
for a chump since the first day I met you.

472
00:23:32,455 --> 00:23:34,868
She would say that, wouldn't she?

473
00:23:35,058 --> 00:23:37,104
The bitch.

474
00:23:37,294 --> 00:23:38,905
You don't believe her, do you?

475
00:23:39,095 --> 00:23:40,974
Well, she did put some incidents

476
00:23:41,164 --> 00:23:44,211
in a different and
troubling light, I must say.

477
00:23:44,401 --> 00:23:46,213
Uh-huh.

478
00:23:46,403 --> 00:23:47,614
Well, that's too bad.

479
00:23:47,804 --> 00:23:48,982
Your turn.

480
00:23:49,172 --> 00:23:50,984
Tell me another secret.

481
00:23:51,174 --> 00:23:53,086
A good one this time.

482
00:23:53,276 --> 00:23:57,457
I took your gun.

483
00:23:57,647 --> 00:24:00,994
I have it right here.

484
00:24:01,184 --> 00:24:03,330
That's a good secret.

485
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,333
I took it because I figured
Mooney had called you somehow.

486
00:24:06,523 --> 00:24:08,969
I knew you might believe her.

487
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:10,904
Doesn't mean she's telling the truth.

488
00:24:11,094 --> 00:24:13,006
Is she?

489
00:24:13,196 --> 00:24:19,980
Have you been playing
me for a chump, Penguin?

490
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:23,016
I think it's your turn to tell a secret.

491
00:24:23,206 --> 00:24:25,018
You little dirtbag.

492
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:26,653
I treated you like a friend.

493
00:24:26,843 --> 00:24:28,655
Like a monkey friend.

494
00:24:28,845 --> 00:24:32,426
You're the zookeeper, remember?

495
00:24:32,616 --> 00:24:34,995
Tell me a secret now.

496
00:24:35,185 --> 00:24:36,997
Just one more then.

497
00:24:37,187 --> 00:24:39,633
I'm tired of this game.

498
00:24:39,823 --> 00:24:42,602
That gun is loaded with blanks.

499
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:51,111
Liar.

500
00:24:51,301 --> 00:24:52,446
- You...
- Yeah.

501
00:24:52,636 --> 00:24:57,451
Good secret, huh?

502
00:25:05,348 --> 00:25:07,160
Hi.

503
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,162
Hi.

504
00:25:09,352 --> 00:25:10,831
Thank you for coming.

505
00:25:11,021 --> 00:25:15,435
I was glad to get your call.

506
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:17,037
How are things at Arkham?

507
00:25:17,227 --> 00:25:19,406
Little less interesting since you've left.

508
00:25:19,596 --> 00:25:20,540
Oh.

509
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,242
How are things at the precinct?

510
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,244
Um, well, actually, that
was what I was hoping

511
00:25:24,434 --> 00:25:25,479
you could help me with.

512
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:27,681
Um, we've got this case,

513
00:25:27,871 --> 00:25:30,484
and I can't understand what
exactly our perp was doing.

514
00:25:30,674 --> 00:25:34,554
And our medical examiner
is kind of a clown.

515
00:25:34,744 --> 00:25:36,389
Uh, something wrong?

516
00:25:36,579 --> 00:25:40,894
No, not at all.

517
00:25:41,084 --> 00:25:44,364
Only, last time we met,
you were very passionate.

518
00:25:44,554 --> 00:25:47,934
So when you called me, I thought...

519
00:25:48,124 --> 00:25:49,936
Well, whatever.

520
00:25:50,126 --> 00:25:51,438
I put on lipstick.

521
00:25:51,628 --> 00:25:53,039
And you want forensic advice.

522
00:25:53,229 --> 00:25:55,709
You're very confusing.

523
00:25:55,899 --> 00:26:00,046
I don't mean to be. Uh...

524
00:26:00,236 --> 00:26:01,581
Case is a pretext.

525
00:26:01,771 --> 00:26:03,016
I wanted to see you.

526
00:26:03,206 --> 00:26:05,018
Why didn't you just say that?

527
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:07,220
I should have. I haven't
done this in a while.

528
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:08,255
I'm a little rusty.

529
00:26:09,145 --> 00:26:10,590
Sorry.

530
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,958
All right.

531
00:26:12,148 --> 00:26:13,193
Well, good.

532
00:26:13,383 --> 00:26:14,928
I don't like to put on lipstick by mistake.

533
00:26:15,118 --> 00:26:16,363
So what's the issue?

534
00:26:16,553 --> 00:26:17,798
Uh, no, no, no, forget the case.

535
00:26:17,988 --> 00:26:19,199
- Don't worry.
- Please.

536
00:26:19,389 --> 00:26:20,600
I'm interested.

537
00:26:22,325 --> 00:26:23,870
Uh...

538
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,973
Excuse me.

539
00:26:27,163 --> 00:26:31,211
Gordon.

540
00:26:31,401 --> 00:26:32,579
When?

541
00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:34,481
Uh, yeah, okay.

542
00:26:34,671 --> 00:26:38,485
Take his statement. I'll be right there.

543
00:26:38,675 --> 00:26:39,953
I'm sorry, I have to go.

544
00:26:40,143 --> 00:26:41,254
I'm fine.

545
00:26:41,444 --> 00:26:42,556
- You sure?
- Yes.

546
00:26:42,746 --> 00:26:49,629
I'll bring this back to you.

547
00:26:51,421 --> 00:26:52,466
It's Harvey.

548
00:26:52,656 --> 00:26:54,468
Harvey, second victim woke up.

549
00:26:54,658 --> 00:26:56,470
Says he was abducted by two men.

550
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:02,075
There's someone still out there.

551
00:27:02,265 --> 00:27:04,878
It's kind of you to come here
and tell us what happened.

552
00:27:05,068 --> 00:27:05,912
No problem.

553
00:27:06,102 --> 00:27:08,648
I just didn't want you worrying, so...

554
00:27:08,838 --> 00:27:11,651
To be honest, you don't strike
me as the fraidy cat type.

555
00:27:11,841 --> 00:27:13,587
Phobics are not fraidy cats.

556
00:27:13,777 --> 00:27:16,590
I know. It's just, you seem
like a strong lady is all.

557
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,091
I am strong.

558
00:27:18,281 --> 00:27:21,094
I just happen to be
terrified of swimming pools.

559
00:27:21,284 --> 00:27:22,496
You're kidding.

560
00:27:22,686 --> 00:27:25,499
Well, I can see how that might be a thing.

561
00:27:25,689 --> 00:27:27,667
Nearly everyone has a thing.

562
00:27:27,857 --> 00:27:30,670
I'm sure that you, if you dig deep enough,

563
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,672
would have issues that
you need to confront.

564
00:27:32,862 --> 00:27:35,542
I'm a cop; the only thing
I'm scared of is decaf coffee.

565
00:27:35,732 --> 00:27:37,978
Really? I've always found

566
00:27:38,168 --> 00:27:39,946
that the best and bravest
people are the ones

567
00:27:40,136 --> 00:27:42,282
that willingly acknowledge their fears.

568
00:27:42,472 --> 00:27:43,683
Maybe you've just been hanging out

569
00:27:43,873 --> 00:27:45,652
with too many timid and whiny people.

570
00:27:46,843 --> 00:27:48,321
You are so bad.

571
00:27:48,511 --> 00:27:50,690
I'm scared all the time.

572
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,659
And it's something I'd be

573
00:27:52,849 --> 00:27:54,594
willing to share with the group

574
00:27:54,784 --> 00:27:56,696
if you think it might be helpful.

575
00:27:56,886 --> 00:27:58,198
Yes.

576
00:27:58,388 --> 00:27:59,633
Yes, thank you.

577
00:27:59,823 --> 00:28:10,343
I think it would.

578
00:28:10,533 --> 00:28:12,179
First time?

579
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:13,380
Yeah. You?

580
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:23,921
No, I'm a regular.

581
00:28:24,111 --> 00:28:26,411
So here's the deal. You go in the car,

582
00:28:26,601 --> 00:28:27,913
the car's already in the crusher,

583
00:28:28,103 --> 00:28:29,248
you get squeezed to death,

584
00:28:29,438 --> 00:28:30,716
it takes a couple of minutes to die.

585
00:28:30,906 --> 00:28:32,718
Whatever comes out, I send to Falcone.

586
00:28:32,908 --> 00:28:34,753
Maybe he uses it as a coffee table.

587
00:28:34,943 --> 00:28:36,622
Don Maroni, please listen to me.

588
00:28:36,812 --> 00:28:38,123
Oh, this is the begging part?

589
00:28:38,313 --> 00:28:39,725
Oh, good, 'cause this is my favorite part.

590
00:28:39,915 --> 00:28:41,960
Go ahead and beg for your miserable life.

591
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,630
Just allow me to suggest some options here.

592
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,797
Mm-hmm.

593
00:28:45,987 --> 00:28:48,200
Dead, I'm worthless.

594
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,203
If you factor in Falcone's
inevitable retaliation,

595
00:28:51,393 --> 00:28:53,772
killing me will be a net loss for you.

596
00:28:53,962 --> 00:28:57,176
This is not a business issue.

597
00:28:57,366 --> 00:28:59,578
Me and Frankie Carbone go back 20 years.

598
00:28:59,768 --> 00:29:00,979
You hurt me, Penguin.

599
00:29:01,169 --> 00:29:03,215
You were right about Indian Hill.

600
00:29:03,405 --> 00:29:05,717
There's more to it.
Falcone knows something.

601
00:29:05,907 --> 00:29:07,953
I don't know what,
b-but I-I can find out...

602
00:29:08,143 --> 00:29:11,623
Stop it. You're making me sad.

603
00:29:11,813 --> 00:29:14,293
How did I ever fall for your crap?

604
00:29:14,483 --> 00:29:15,294
N-No.

605
00:29:15,484 --> 00:29:16,762
No. No. No.

606
00:29:16,952 --> 00:29:17,963
Please. Please.

607
00:29:18,153 --> 00:29:19,598
No. No.

608
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,572
Hey.

609
00:29:26,762 --> 00:30:03,776
Say hi to Frankie for me.

610
00:30:03,966 --> 00:30:06,378
I'm afraid every day.

611
00:30:06,568 --> 00:30:10,650
I'm afraid I'm gonna die in an alley.

612
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,220
Bleeding out while some
scumbag goes through my pockets

613
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,489
and laughs at me.

614
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:19,426
And I try to speak, but nothing comes out.

615
00:30:19,616 --> 00:30:21,261
And I just lie there,

616
00:30:21,451 --> 00:30:25,198
staring at a small space of
sky between the buildings.

617
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:28,034
And then I die.

618
00:30:28,224 --> 00:30:30,503
Alone.

619
00:30:30,693 --> 00:30:34,174
I don't want to die alone in some gutter.

620
00:30:34,364 --> 00:30:38,011
I want to die in a warm cozy bed

621
00:30:38,201 --> 00:30:41,948
in the arms of a beautiful woman.

622
00:30:42,138 --> 00:30:49,222
Thank you for sharing, Harvey.

623
00:30:49,412 --> 00:30:53,560
Would anyone else like to share?

624
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,488
Tod, go ahead.

625
00:30:56,678 --> 00:30:58,765
My name is Tod, and...

626
00:30:58,955 --> 00:31:02,135
I've never spoken here before, but...

627
00:31:02,325 --> 00:31:05,572
I have a horrible terror of failure.

628
00:31:05,762 --> 00:31:08,575
I torment myself and those around me.

629
00:31:08,765 --> 00:31:12,379
I'd crawl on broken glass to avoid failing.

630
00:31:12,569 --> 00:31:14,381
About anything.

631
00:31:14,571 --> 00:31:17,817
I inherited this illness from my father,

632
00:31:18,007 --> 00:31:27,594
but I'm afraid I'm passing it on to my son.

633
00:31:27,784 --> 00:31:29,729
We're here for you, Tod.

634
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,400
When I came home from work yesterday,

635
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:36,069
my precious son was crying,

636
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:40,907
and he said to me that he...

637
00:31:41,097 --> 00:31:42,108
I'm sorry.

638
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:43,143
I can't speak.

639
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:44,778
- I'm so sorry.
- Tod?

640
00:31:44,968 --> 00:31:46,980
Tod.

641
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:51,351
Tod?

642
00:32:04,487 --> 00:32:06,499
Oh, you got to be kidding me. What?

643
00:32:06,689 --> 00:32:07,934
Don Maroni, you have to listen to me.

644
00:32:08,124 --> 00:32:08,935
Uh, see, no.

645
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:11,171
This is how this all
began, me listening to you.

646
00:32:11,361 --> 00:32:13,006
I was telling the truth.

647
00:32:13,196 --> 00:32:14,274
About Indian Hill.

648
00:32:14,464 --> 00:32:15,508
And Arkham.

649
00:32:15,698 --> 00:32:18,878
Whoever controls Arkham
will control Gotham! I can...

650
00:32:19,068 --> 00:32:22,115
Would you shut up and take it like a man?

651
00:32:39,355 --> 00:32:40,367
Yuh-huh.

652
00:32:40,557 --> 00:32:41,801
Hello, is this Mr. Duffy?

653
00:32:41,991 --> 00:32:42,802
Yuh-huh.

654
00:32:42,992 --> 00:32:43,870
Listen to me very carefully.

655
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,872
I'm the man in the car

656
00:32:46,062 --> 00:32:47,574
in this ferocious machine of yours.

657
00:32:47,764 --> 00:32:49,509
My name is Oswald Cobblepot.

658
00:32:49,699 --> 00:32:52,479
And I work for Don Carmine
Falcone of Gotham City.

659
00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:54,714
- Do you know who Don Falcone is?
- Yuh-huh.

660
00:32:54,904 --> 00:32:55,715
Good.

661
00:32:55,905 --> 00:32:58,385
I just called Don Falcone, and I told him

662
00:32:58,575 --> 00:33:00,754
exactly where I am and what's happening.

663
00:33:00,944 --> 00:33:04,224
So, Duffy, you better stop
this machine right now,

664
00:33:04,414 --> 00:33:05,892
because if I die,

665
00:33:06,082 --> 00:33:07,994
Don Falcone is gonna send a team up here

666
00:33:08,184 --> 00:33:11,331
to skin you alive and
slaughter your family.

667
00:33:11,521 --> 00:33:12,365
But Don Maroni said...

668
00:33:12,555 --> 00:33:14,868
Don Falcone runs Gotham,

669
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:19,739
and you're about to
murder his right-hand man.

670
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:34,120
What the hell?

671
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,889
Hey!

672
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:57,877
Get back here!

673
00:33:58,067 --> 00:34:00,380
Son of a bitch.

674
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:02,782
Is it just me, or have those two

675
00:34:02,972 --> 00:34:09,956
been gone a while?

676
00:34:10,146 --> 00:34:20,467
This has been real and
fun, but I got to go.

677
00:34:52,154 --> 00:34:53,465
Oh, my God.

678
00:35:00,513 --> 00:35:02,425
This isn't what it looks like.

679
00:35:02,615 --> 00:35:05,095
Other members say our abductor's
been coming the last month.

680
00:35:05,285 --> 00:35:07,297
Said his name was Tod, but group protocol

681
00:35:07,487 --> 00:35:08,771
requires they remain anonymous.

682
00:35:08,961 --> 00:35:10,206
So no real I.D.

683
00:35:10,396 --> 00:35:12,208
And the guy you shot,
the one with the pigs?

684
00:35:12,398 --> 00:35:13,709
Prints came back: career criminal.

685
00:35:13,899 --> 00:35:16,078
Probably just the muscle.
The other guy was in charge.

686
00:35:16,268 --> 00:35:18,514
He knew there was a cop
there at the meeting.

687
00:35:18,704 --> 00:35:20,049
He still took her.

688
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:21,750
That's cold or crazy.

689
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,320
Either way, he's almost
sure to follow the same M.O.

690
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,522
He'll confront Miss Mullens
with her greatest fear.

691
00:35:26,712 --> 00:35:28,891
- Which is drowning.
- Specifically in a pool.

692
00:35:29,081 --> 00:35:30,092
There's hundreds of pools in Gotham.

693
00:35:30,282 --> 00:35:31,093
We can't possibly get

694
00:35:31,283 --> 00:35:32,895
- to every...
- That was her mother.

695
00:35:33,085 --> 00:35:34,196
When she was seven, Scottie almost drowned

696
00:35:34,386 --> 00:35:35,993
in Lemmars Park pool uptown.

697
00:35:36,183 --> 00:35:37,600
It's a start, I guess.

698
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:41,704
That's where he took her, I can feel it.

699
00:35:41,894 --> 00:35:43,706
- Boss?
- Uh, not now, Joe.

700
00:35:43,896 --> 00:35:47,109
Wait.

701
00:35:47,299 --> 00:35:52,014
Tell me that's not what it looks like.

702
00:35:52,204 --> 00:35:54,016
You're brave.

703
00:35:54,206 --> 00:35:59,388
I'd say you're an eight on the Crane Scale.

704
00:35:59,578 --> 00:36:01,290
Profound fear.

705
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,359
12 is top.

706
00:36:03,549 --> 00:36:05,761
Abject heart-stopping terror.

707
00:36:05,951 --> 00:36:08,431
I'm surprised you're only an eight.

708
00:36:08,621 --> 00:36:12,401
You do understand that
this is really happening?

709
00:36:12,591 --> 00:36:13,936
I'm going to drown you.

710
00:36:16,061 --> 00:36:17,973
Right now.

711
00:36:18,163 --> 00:36:21,710
There! That's a ten.

712
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,447
Dad.

713
00:36:26,105 --> 00:36:27,817
Jonathan, I said to wait in the van.

714
00:36:28,007 --> 00:36:31,387
The parking meter ran out.

715
00:36:35,247 --> 00:36:37,226
Look, son, I know this hard,

716
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:38,961
but we talked about it.

717
00:36:39,151 --> 00:36:43,599
It's for the common good, for humanity.

718
00:36:43,789 --> 00:36:45,568
I know. I just... I think...

719
00:36:45,758 --> 00:36:47,903
This will be over soon. Here.

720
00:36:48,093 --> 00:36:50,106
Go and feed the meter.

721
00:36:50,296 --> 00:36:52,942
Go on, go.

722
00:37:01,674 --> 00:37:03,085
Now, my dear,

723
00:37:03,275 --> 00:37:04,920
don't think badly of me.

724
00:37:31,036 --> 00:37:32,014
GCPD!

725
00:37:32,204 --> 00:37:39,655
Don't move!

726
00:37:39,845 --> 00:38:34,076
I'm on him! You get her!

727
00:39:11,371 --> 00:39:13,650
He's alive.

728
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,485
I told you he was alive.

729
00:39:15,675 --> 00:39:18,054
Praise the Lord.

730
00:39:18,244 --> 00:39:21,224
Glory be.

731
00:39:21,414 --> 00:39:23,493
What happened to you, boy?

732
00:39:23,683 --> 00:39:27,397
Like the prodigal son,
ma'am, I have fallen.

733
00:39:27,587 --> 00:39:28,565
Like Job,

734
00:39:28,755 --> 00:39:30,467
I've been tested in the deepest pits

735
00:39:30,657 --> 00:39:32,602
of the devil's perfidy
and survived.

736
00:39:32,792 --> 00:39:40,543
Lord have mercy.

737
00:39:40,733 --> 00:39:43,113
Are you headed to Gotham
City, by any chance?

738
00:39:43,303 --> 00:39:44,581
Sure.

739
00:39:44,771 --> 00:39:46,016
Come on.

740
00:40:19,105 --> 00:40:21,084
Case files you gave me about that man

741
00:40:21,274 --> 00:40:22,552
who was thrown from the roof.

742
00:40:22,742 --> 00:40:23,887
Did you catch his killer yet?

743
00:40:24,077 --> 00:40:25,589
Uh, no. He's still out there.

744
00:40:25,779 --> 00:40:26,923
- Hi.
- I followed up,

745
00:40:27,113 --> 00:40:28,458
and I had a quick look at his corpse.

746
00:40:28,648 --> 00:40:30,227
A quick look at his corpse?

747
00:40:30,417 --> 00:40:31,962
Yeah, its' just downstairs
at the morgue. No trouble.

748
00:40:32,152 --> 00:40:33,830
So the killer removed his adrenal glands.

749
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,298
Adrenal glands? That's strange.

750
00:40:35,488 --> 00:40:37,133
They have no value on
the black market, do they?

751
00:40:37,323 --> 00:40:38,935
No. Kidneys and livers, yes.

752
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:40,437
Adrenal glands, no.

753
00:40:40,627 --> 00:40:43,273
It produces cortisol,
the hormone that gives us

754
00:40:43,463 --> 00:40:45,475
that adrenalized
fight-or-flight reaction.

755
00:40:45,665 --> 00:40:47,644
Essentially, it's the fear gland.

756
00:40:47,834 --> 00:40:50,514
And our man wants to
take it from the victim

757
00:40:50,704 --> 00:40:52,649
when he's most fearful. Why do that?

758
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:55,151
All I can think of is that
at the moment of death,

759
00:40:55,341 --> 00:40:57,487
the victim's adrenals
would produce a massive,

760
00:40:57,677 --> 00:40:59,456
highly-elevated form of cortisol.

761
00:40:59,646 --> 00:41:01,124
Fascinating, huh?

762
00:41:01,314 --> 00:41:02,826
This is one weird dude.

763
00:41:03,016 --> 00:41:05,595
A doctor or a nurse, most likely.

764
00:41:05,785 --> 00:41:08,431
Takes some skill to remove
adrenals as cleanly as they did.

765
00:41:08,621 --> 00:41:10,333
You really like this kind of work, huh?

766
00:41:10,523 --> 00:41:11,601
I do.

767
00:41:11,791 --> 00:41:12,769
Good.

768
00:41:12,959 --> 00:41:14,137
Maybe there'll be more for you.

769
00:41:14,327 --> 00:41:16,873
A full-time job, even.

770
00:41:17,063 --> 00:41:19,009
Our M.E. has been fired
for stealing body parts.

771
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:21,778
- Can you believe that?
- Only in Gotham.

772
00:41:21,968 --> 00:41:26,149
So, what do you say we
discuss this potential job

773
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:28,785
over dinner?

774
00:41:28,975 --> 00:41:30,954
Nice segue, Mr. Smooth.

775
00:41:31,144 --> 00:41:32,189
Thank you.

776
00:41:32,379 --> 00:41:34,157
Dinner sounds good.

777
00:41:34,347 --> 00:41:36,726
Are you gonna bring your case files?

778
00:41:36,916 --> 00:41:38,829
Go ahead, mock my crude dating skills.

779
00:41:39,019 --> 00:41:40,564
I'm doing my best.

780
00:41:40,754 --> 00:41:45,702
You're doing fine.

781
00:41:45,892 --> 00:41:49,739
I have a powerful urge
to kiss you right now.

782
00:41:49,929 --> 00:41:56,646
Why don't you?

783
00:41:56,836 --> 00:41:58,248
Because I'm on duty,

784
00:41:58,438 --> 00:42:00,851
and, uh...

785
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:02,719
there's about 50 people watching us.

786
00:42:02,909 --> 00:42:04,187
Scaredy-cat.

787
00:42:04,377 --> 00:42:06,323
Damn straight. I have an image to keep up.

788
00:42:06,513 --> 00:42:09,559
The heartless, by-the-book, hard man.

789
00:42:09,749 --> 00:42:11,928
Kind of.

790
00:42:12,118 --> 00:42:14,197
On the count of three, I'm gonna lean in,

791
00:42:14,387 --> 00:42:15,365
so that it's subtle.

792
00:42:15,555 --> 00:42:16,399
Then you're gonna kiss me

793
00:42:16,589 --> 00:42:18,068
on the cheek or no dinner.

794
00:42:18,258 --> 00:42:22,739
Come on. I'm serious.

795
00:42:22,929 --> 00:42:25,242
One,

796
00:42:25,432 --> 00:42:28,044
two,

797
00:42:28,234 --> 00:42:48,398
three.

798
00:42:48,588 --> 00:42:50,434
I'm not leaving after all.

799
00:42:50,624 --> 00:42:52,436
What?

800
00:42:52,626 --> 00:42:54,404
It turns out that the
medical examiner is leaving,

801
00:42:54,594 --> 00:42:56,406
so Captain Essen decided to reinstate me.

802
00:42:56,596 --> 00:42:57,774
Oh.

803
00:42:57,964 --> 00:43:03,547
Okay, good.

804
00:43:03,737 --> 00:43:08,385
Mr. Nygma?

805
00:43:08,575 --> 00:43:14,558
You owe me a new pencil.

806
00:43:28,795 --> 00:43:29,806
What's going on? What's happening?

807
00:43:29,996 --> 00:43:30,807
I can hide you.

808
00:43:30,997 --> 00:43:32,642
Quickly.

809
00:43:44,377 --> 00:43:48,966
