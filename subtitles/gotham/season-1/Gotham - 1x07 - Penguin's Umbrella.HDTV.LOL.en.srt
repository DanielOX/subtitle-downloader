1
00:00:01,581 --> 00:00:04,116
There's a war coming, a terrible war.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,751
There will be chaos!

3
00:00:05,785 --> 00:00:07,332
Rivers of blood in the streets.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,681
I know it! I-I can see it coming!

5
00:00:09,716 --> 00:00:11,741
It's time.
Somebody has to take over.

6
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:13,530
It might as well be me.

7
00:00:15,622 --> 00:00:17,322
My name's James Gordon, a detective.

8
00:00:17,357 --> 00:00:19,091
- My name is Bruce Wayne.
- I promise I will find

9
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,359
the man who did this.

10
00:00:20,393 --> 00:00:21,527
Stop or I'll shoot!

11
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:24,196
Mario Pepper was framed

12
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,597
by Fish Mooney and the cops.

13
00:00:25,632 --> 00:00:27,499
Why snitch on your own boss?

14
00:00:27,534 --> 00:00:28,967
You want to push Fish out.

15
00:00:30,303 --> 00:00:33,005
I told you this is important.

16
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:34,306
I ain't looking for no girl.

17
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,974
I'm looking for a weapon.

18
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:37,543
The old man has to go.

19
00:00:37,577 --> 00:00:41,013
He figures out we're working
together, we're cooked.

20
00:00:41,047 --> 00:00:42,548
You're under arrest for the murder

21
00:00:42,582 --> 00:00:43,816
of Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot.

22
00:00:45,185 --> 00:00:46,185
Holy crap.

23
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:49,655
I... am Oswald Cobblepot.

24
00:00:53,993 --> 00:00:55,527
You son of a bitch!

25
00:01:07,237 --> 00:01:09,638
He's alive?!

26
00:01:09,673 --> 00:01:10,873
Alive?!

27
00:01:11,908 --> 00:01:13,809
No!

28
00:01:13,843 --> 00:01:15,577
Boss, what's wrong?

29
00:01:15,612 --> 00:01:18,080
Gordon didn't kill
Penguin like he was told.

30
00:01:18,114 --> 00:01:19,648
What?

31
00:01:19,683 --> 00:01:21,717
Penguin is still alive
and working for Maroni?

32
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:24,553
No.

33
00:01:24,587 --> 00:01:28,190
You go find Gordon,
and you bring him to me.

34
00:01:28,224 --> 00:01:30,326
Still breathing.

35
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,725
I want to talk to that son of a bitch.

36
00:01:32,763 --> 00:01:34,263
Hey,
guys. Leave a message.

37
00:01:34,298 --> 00:01:36,899
Barbara, if you're at home, listen to me.

38
00:01:36,934 --> 00:01:39,569
I need you to get out right now.

39
00:01:42,573 --> 00:01:44,774
- I thought we were friends.
- Harvey!

40
00:01:44,808 --> 00:01:46,842
Shut up! Game's over.

41
00:01:46,877 --> 00:01:49,378
Now I got to kill you and
take your body back to Falcone,

42
00:01:49,413 --> 00:01:51,714
and beg, beg him for mercy!

43
00:01:51,748 --> 00:01:53,382
Listen to me. I screwed up.

44
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:55,284
But I have a plan to make things right.

45
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:57,086
Don't kill me. Help me.

46
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,387
You think I'm an idiot?

47
00:01:59,256 --> 00:02:01,023
Walk away!

48
00:02:01,058 --> 00:02:02,225
Walk away.

49
00:02:06,597 --> 00:02:08,564
Help me.

50
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,233
We don't have to go out like this.

51
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:12,435
You better hope you never see me again.

52
00:02:22,179 --> 00:02:24,280
Wow.

53
00:02:24,314 --> 00:02:25,648
What a place, huh?

54
00:02:28,785 --> 00:02:32,955
A beautiful home for a beautiful lady.

55
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:36,459
Please tell me what you want.

56
00:02:36,493 --> 00:02:39,562
I guess there's no harm in the truth.

57
00:02:39,596 --> 00:02:42,131
See, your boyfriend was supposed to kill

58
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,466
a certain person for somebody.

59
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,735
Only, he didn't.

60
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:49,705
And now that somebody is real mad.

61
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,140
Cobblepot.

62
00:02:51,175 --> 00:02:52,575
What?

63
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:54,310
He didn't kill Cobblepot.

64
00:02:54,344 --> 00:02:56,646
There you go!

65
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,514
You're hip.

66
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:00,416
You are hip.

67
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,953
That Jim Gordon is one lucky son of a gun.

68
00:03:03,987 --> 00:03:07,857
What are you, like, a hundred pounds?

69
00:03:07,891 --> 00:03:10,660
110?

70
00:03:11,695 --> 00:03:13,463
Oh.

71
00:03:13,497 --> 00:03:17,300
I bet that's your real hair color, too.

72
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:20,436
What are you gonna... do to Jim?

73
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:23,306
You ever been with a criminal?

74
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,475
Some ladies find it a turn-on.

75
00:03:27,511 --> 00:03:29,479
- Jim.
- Hey!

76
00:03:29,513 --> 00:03:31,481
Speak of the devil.

77
00:03:31,515 --> 00:03:33,149
I was just getting to
know your lovely lady.

78
00:03:33,183 --> 00:03:34,183
You're trespassing. Get out.

79
00:03:34,218 --> 00:03:36,185
Whoa. Slow down, hoss.

80
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,155
You're misreading the situation.
I'm the shot caller here.

81
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:41,324
The situation is you've been
told to bring me in alive,

82
00:03:41,358 --> 00:03:42,859
or I'd be dead already.

83
00:03:42,893 --> 00:03:44,827
But I'm happy to kill
you right here and now.

84
00:03:44,862 --> 00:03:46,028
Don't be such a hard-ass.

85
00:03:46,063 --> 00:03:47,497
Come on, you know the rules.

86
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:51,067
You play nice, you take your lumps...

87
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:52,969
nobody else gets hurt.

88
00:03:53,003 --> 00:03:55,037
Tell your friend to drop his
gun or I'll blow his brains out.

89
00:03:55,072 --> 00:03:56,839
- Oh, my God, Jim.
- It's okay. It's under control.

90
00:03:56,874 --> 00:03:58,775
Drop your gun.

91
00:04:03,847 --> 00:04:05,948
Okay.

92
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:07,383
Have it your way.

93
00:04:07,418 --> 00:04:11,387
But now, after we kill you,
we're gonna kill blondie, too.

94
00:04:11,422 --> 00:04:13,956
Nice and slow.

95
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:22,351
We Right now.

96
00:04:22,385 --> 00:04:24,386
Barbara.

97
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,421
The
Westbound Interstate Express

98
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:28,624
departs in five minutes, Bay 12.

99
00:04:28,658 --> 00:04:30,058
Barbara.

100
00:04:30,093 --> 00:04:33,061
- What?
- Listen.

101
00:04:33,096 --> 00:04:35,397
No, no. No.

102
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:37,933
Just a couple of days and I'll join you.

103
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:39,401
There are things I need to do.

104
00:04:39,435 --> 00:04:41,403
Fine. Then if you stay, I stay.

105
00:04:41,437 --> 00:04:43,372
Okay? Because I love you, Jim.

106
00:04:43,406 --> 00:04:45,407
- I cannot leave you.
- I love you, too.

107
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:47,943
That's why you need to leave.

108
00:04:47,977 --> 00:04:51,246
If I know you're safe, there's
nothing they can do to me.

109
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:55,617
I'll make things right,
and then I'll come join you.

110
00:04:57,453 --> 00:04:58,987
And what if you don't?

111
00:05:01,457 --> 00:05:03,692
Don't come back.

112
00:05:05,562 --> 00:05:08,297
Don't come back to Gotham.

113
00:05:08,331 --> 00:05:10,165
No, Jim.

114
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,225
Gordon's here.

115
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:02,593
Is he nuts?

116
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:06,163
What's he doing here?

117
00:06:06,197 --> 00:06:08,198
You believe this guy?

118
00:06:12,191 --> 00:06:13,491
Hey, Alvarez.

119
00:06:13,526 --> 00:06:16,027
You got any of those blank warrants

120
00:06:16,062 --> 00:06:18,096
that Judge Bam Bam signed?

121
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,331
Uh... yeah.

122
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:40,892
This cannot stand.

123
00:06:40,926 --> 00:06:43,261
Gordon must die, Bullock must die,

124
00:06:43,295 --> 00:06:45,630
Penguin must die today!

125
00:06:45,664 --> 00:06:47,932
And Maroni, too, I suppose?

126
00:06:47,966 --> 00:06:50,335
If need be.

127
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,639
You're overreacting, my
dear. This Penguin's a nobody.

128
00:06:54,673 --> 00:06:56,074
You want to start a war

129
00:06:56,108 --> 00:06:57,775
over the guy that carried your umbrella?

130
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,111
He was on my hip everywhere with me.

131
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:01,579
He knows things.

132
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:02,580
Like what?

133
00:07:02,614 --> 00:07:06,017
Too much. He knows too much!

134
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,318
Go to Maroni

135
00:07:07,353 --> 00:07:09,954
and ask him politely to
hand over your little man.

136
00:07:09,989 --> 00:07:11,022
Politely.

137
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,657
If he refuses,

138
00:07:12,691 --> 00:07:14,993
we can talk about stronger measures.

139
00:07:15,027 --> 00:07:16,995
Boss, this is weak response.

140
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:20,798
I hate to agree with Fish, but
we need to show strength now.

141
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,101
We need to hit back hard. No talk.

142
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,336
Penguin dead, Gordon dead, done.

143
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:28,172
Relax, Niko. I know what I'm doing.

144
00:07:28,207 --> 00:07:29,607
Where is Gordon?

145
00:07:29,642 --> 00:07:30,975
I thought you were bringing him with you.

146
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,045
No. He wouldn't come without a struggle.

147
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,581
Now, I don't know if he's
playing tough or crazy,

148
00:07:36,615 --> 00:07:39,217
but he's at work like nothing's wrong.

149
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,152
I'll send Victor to fetch him.

150
00:07:41,186 --> 00:07:43,655
No need. My guys can handle him.

151
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:46,090
I'll send Victor.

152
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,795
That's a nice handsome bird, huh?

153
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:53,731
I don't know chickens.

154
00:08:02,374 --> 00:08:03,474
Fall back.

155
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:04,842
The old man is right there.

156
00:08:04,877 --> 00:08:06,544
Screw him. He's done.

157
00:08:06,578 --> 00:08:08,179
Now's the time to strike.

158
00:08:08,213 --> 00:08:10,081
- Not yet.
- Not yet, not yet.

159
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,050
If not now, when? Look at him.

160
00:08:12,084 --> 00:08:14,686
Maroni clan are laughing at
us, and he plays with chickens.

161
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,754
That's what has me worried.

162
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:18,923
The chickens. He's happy, relaxed,

163
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,059
as if he doesn't have a care in the world.

164
00:08:21,093 --> 00:08:23,728
- That girl of yours is doing her job then.
- No.

165
00:08:23,762 --> 00:08:25,730
She says he hasn't even touched her.

166
00:08:25,764 --> 00:08:27,665
She cooks and she cleans for him.

167
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,500
He likes to watch her do chores.

168
00:08:29,535 --> 00:08:31,035
Weird.

169
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,504
- But if that's his thing...
- No.

170
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,607
He's acting as if he
knows something important

171
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:37,875
that no one else knows.

172
00:08:46,051 --> 00:08:48,253
What the hell are you doing here?

173
00:08:48,287 --> 00:08:51,356
I work here. It's my shift.
Where else should I be?

174
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,725
How about Alaska?

175
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,694
Arrest warrants? For who?

176
00:08:56,729 --> 00:08:58,563
Mayor Aubrey James, Carmine Falcone

177
00:08:58,597 --> 00:09:00,031
and their close associates.

178
00:09:00,065 --> 00:09:02,233
On charges of conspiracy
and perversion of justice

179
00:09:02,268 --> 00:09:03,635
in the Wayne murder case.

180
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:06,971
- Are you insane?
- No.

181
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:08,640
Maybe a little.

182
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:10,275
Feels good.

183
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:12,377
They're gonna try and kill me anyway.

184
00:09:12,411 --> 00:09:14,112
Might as well make them pay a price for it.

185
00:09:14,146 --> 00:09:17,081
You're gonna arrest the
mayor and Don Falcone. How?

186
00:09:17,116 --> 00:09:19,484
My testimony is attached to the warrants.

187
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,953
That alone is enough to
indict them on a dozen counts.

188
00:09:21,987 --> 00:09:24,589
Sure, if you could execute
the warrants, which you can't.

189
00:09:24,623 --> 00:09:27,125
If the D.A. would
prosecute, which he won't.

190
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,393
There's not a single cop or lawyer

191
00:09:28,427 --> 00:09:30,094
in the city who will help you.

192
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:32,163
I think there are plenty
of people willing to help me

193
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,932
once they see it's possible to fight back.

194
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:36,801
You're dreaming. Nobody will help you.

195
00:09:36,835 --> 00:09:38,236
I won't help you.

196
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,773
You don't think I want
change just like you do?

197
00:09:41,807 --> 00:09:43,474
I have a family.

198
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:47,011
I understand.

199
00:09:47,046 --> 00:09:49,547
Gordon...

200
00:09:49,582 --> 00:09:51,783
get out of town.

201
00:09:51,817 --> 00:09:54,085
This is my home.

202
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:55,913
It was my father's home.

203
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:58,556
I'm not leaving.

204
00:10:31,357 --> 00:10:33,258
Hello, everyone.

205
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:37,128
My name is Victor Zsasz.

206
00:10:37,163 --> 00:10:41,466
I'm sent here personally by
Don Carmine Falcone himself

207
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,468
on a matter of deep concern to him,

208
00:10:43,502 --> 00:10:45,003
so please be respectful.

209
00:10:45,037 --> 00:10:46,804
I'm here

210
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:48,506
for Jim Gordon.

211
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,008
Only him.

212
00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:52,877
Everybody else, mind your
business and we're cool.

213
00:10:52,912 --> 00:10:54,579
So where's Jim at?

214
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:03,588
Thank you.

215
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:04,889
Hey, Jim!

216
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,460
Jim.

217
00:11:20,372 --> 00:11:22,607
Hi, Jim.

218
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:24,209
Relax.

219
00:11:24,243 --> 00:11:25,877
I'm supposed to take you in alive.

220
00:11:25,911 --> 00:11:28,913
Don Falcone wants to talk.

221
00:11:28,948 --> 00:11:30,782
Tell Falcone we'll talk.

222
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,250
But not today.

223
00:11:32,284 --> 00:11:35,920
Don't be that way.

224
00:11:35,955 --> 00:11:38,790
"Alive" is a very broad category.

225
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:42,627
A man with no hands can still be alive.

226
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,963
There are 50 cops in here.

227
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:46,698
Try something.

228
00:11:46,732 --> 00:11:47,932
Everybody out.

229
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:54,606
Please?!

230
00:12:09,522 --> 00:12:11,756
Go, boss.

231
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,324
Get out of here.

232
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:14,926
- Jim...
- Go.

233
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,961
I can handle this.

234
00:12:30,643 --> 00:12:32,510
Well, how now, Jim?

235
00:14:02,835 --> 00:14:04,302
Jim?

236
00:14:12,345 --> 00:14:13,945
Jim?

237
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:21,152
Why are you hiding from me, Jim?

238
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,303
Hey!

239
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:39,671
What the...?

240
00:14:47,313 --> 00:14:48,613
There!

241
00:15:06,465 --> 00:15:07,933
You need a ride?

242
00:15:13,272 --> 00:15:15,874
Go, go, go, go, go!

243
00:15:31,657 --> 00:15:33,358
No.

244
00:15:35,328 --> 00:15:36,862
No, please.

245
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,742
Twenty-eight.

246
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,427
Ah, you're back.

247
00:16:05,412 --> 00:16:06,728
How do you feel?

248
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:08,760
Terrible.

249
00:16:10,115 --> 00:16:11,623
Where am I? Who are you?

250
00:16:11,674 --> 00:16:13,540
I'm a friend of Montoya and Allen.

251
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:16,760
I just took two bullets
out of you and sewed you up.

252
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,481
Now I'm checking to see how you're doing.

253
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,973
So... Who are you?

254
00:16:21,011 --> 00:16:23,324
What city are we in and
what day of the week is it?

255
00:16:24,934 --> 00:16:27,464
I'm James Gordon. We're in Gotham.

256
00:16:28,026 --> 00:16:30,556
It's friday. Why are there rats?

257
00:16:30,581 --> 00:16:32,626
It's a dissection lab at the university.

258
00:16:34,956 --> 00:16:37,486
I gather you're a fugitive from the mob,

259
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,838
Can't go to the hospital, said Crispus.

260
00:16:40,081 --> 00:16:41,550
It's very exciting, I must say.

261
00:16:42,863 --> 00:16:45,751
- How long have I been out?
- Just a couple of hours or so.

262
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:49,214
You're very lucky. No vital organs
were... Whoa, whoa, lie back down.

263
00:16:49,253 --> 00:16:51,003
Okay? You are hurt.

264
00:16:51,054 --> 00:16:52,614
Just a week or so in bed...

265
00:16:52,631 --> 00:16:55,571
- I have to go.
- James, you have lost a lot of blood.

266
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:57,833
You have to do as I say and lie back down.

267
00:16:57,909 --> 00:16:59,076
If you don't, you could die.

268
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,878
I have to stand. Can you help me?

269
00:17:00,912 --> 00:17:02,145
Okay, okay.

270
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,413
Crispus?

271
00:17:03,448 --> 00:17:04,615
He said he's leaving already.

272
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,283
I have to go. Now.

273
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:07,751
Sure.

274
00:17:07,785 --> 00:17:10,087
Some clothes would be good though.

275
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:17,394
This is about tradition, values.

276
00:17:17,428 --> 00:17:19,062
Snitches get stitches...

277
00:17:19,097 --> 00:17:20,330
that's how it's always been.

278
00:17:20,365 --> 00:17:21,965
You need to hand him over, Sal.

279
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,233
I know.

280
00:17:23,268 --> 00:17:24,601
I should.

281
00:17:24,636 --> 00:17:26,303
But what can I say?

282
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:29,139
The little guy amuses me.

283
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,408
Don Falcone is going to be very unhappy.

284
00:17:31,442 --> 00:17:33,911
You want to start a war over this punk?

285
00:17:33,945 --> 00:17:36,847
War? Whoa.

286
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:38,782
He's that important to you, is he?

287
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:40,751
Oh, no.

288
00:17:40,785 --> 00:17:42,286
He means nothing to us.

289
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,255
Respect is what matters here.

290
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,991
Respect I understand.

291
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,259
Penguin!

292
00:17:49,294 --> 00:17:51,295
Come on out here.

293
00:17:53,002 --> 00:17:55,165
Don't be scared. She won't bite.

294
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,466
You won't bite him, will you?

295
00:18:03,508 --> 00:18:05,142
Hello, Penguin.

296
00:18:05,176 --> 00:18:07,744
Hello, Ms. Mooney.

297
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:10,814
Penguin, Ms. Mooney and her boss,

298
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:15,018
Mr. Falcone, feel disrespected by you.

299
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:16,386
Oh, dear.

300
00:18:16,421 --> 00:18:19,223
Well, that certainly has
never been my intention.

301
00:18:19,257 --> 00:18:21,992
Well, respect is
very important to them.

302
00:18:22,026 --> 00:18:24,995
Now, I want a sincere apology from you

303
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:26,597
for making them feel that way.

304
00:18:26,631 --> 00:18:29,399
Oh, gosh, of course.

305
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:31,468
If I've in any way

306
00:18:31,503 --> 00:18:33,770
caused anyone to feel a lack of respect,

307
00:18:33,805 --> 00:18:37,674
I apologize. Sincerely.

308
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:39,409
There you go.

309
00:18:39,444 --> 00:18:41,411
Can't say fairer than that.

310
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,918
Bloodshed, then.

311
00:18:47,952 --> 00:18:49,920
I'm glad.

312
00:18:49,954 --> 00:18:52,122
Jolly fat men are so tiresome.

313
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,959
And you...

314
00:18:55,994 --> 00:19:02,232
you little scaly-faced bitch.

315
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:07,371
Oh... what I'm gonna do to you.

316
00:19:09,374 --> 00:19:13,710
"Torture" is far too nice of a word.

317
00:19:13,745 --> 00:19:16,947
I'm sorry you feel that way, Fish...

318
00:19:24,489 --> 00:19:28,959
Only my friends... call me Fish.

319
00:19:58,056 --> 00:19:59,723
Hey, sisters!

320
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:02,493
How's it hanging?

321
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,673
Holy...!

322
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:32,700
Tell your boss Falcone won't let

323
00:20:32,735 --> 00:20:34,602
any of Maroni's trucks over the bridge.

324
00:20:34,636 --> 00:20:35,937
Not till he gives up Penguin.

325
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:38,139
So, listen, you got to get hurt a little.

326
00:20:38,173 --> 00:20:39,874
You want a beating or a bullet?

327
00:20:39,908 --> 00:20:41,209
Why we got to get hurt?

328
00:20:41,243 --> 00:20:44,011
Because we're sending a
message this is a serious issue.

329
00:20:44,046 --> 00:20:45,847
We'll tell him it's serious. No problem.

330
00:20:45,881 --> 00:20:47,448
Ah, you know what?

331
00:20:52,554 --> 00:20:55,523
How did they find out
about the gun truck, huh?!

332
00:20:55,557 --> 00:20:57,992
That's $3 mil per week right there!

333
00:20:58,027 --> 00:20:59,894
Son of a bitch!

334
00:20:59,928 --> 00:21:01,896
$4.5 mil per, gross. Cash.

335
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,464
Very aggressive move, isn't it?

336
00:21:03,499 --> 00:21:05,333
An overreaction.

337
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:06,701
They want to scare you.

338
00:21:06,735 --> 00:21:08,369
Oh, is that right? You
think that they think

339
00:21:08,404 --> 00:21:09,504
that Don Maroni can be scared?

340
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:11,706
Of course, you're right. No.

341
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,542
But why, then, would
they react so ferociously?

342
00:21:14,576 --> 00:21:16,044
Why do they want me back so badly?

343
00:21:16,078 --> 00:21:17,311
I know why.

344
00:21:17,346 --> 00:21:20,581
Because they know I got
a stone moneymaker here.

345
00:21:20,616 --> 00:21:22,183
A golden goose.

346
00:21:22,217 --> 00:21:24,519
They know it, and they
don't want us to have him.

347
00:21:24,553 --> 00:21:25,520
Right, Penguin?

348
00:21:25,554 --> 00:21:27,355
Honk, honk.

349
00:21:29,792 --> 00:21:31,059
What?

350
00:21:31,093 --> 00:21:32,660
Honk, honk.

351
00:21:32,695 --> 00:21:34,262
It's what geese say.

352
00:21:34,296 --> 00:21:35,430
Oh, right, right.

353
00:21:35,464 --> 00:21:36,664
Honk, honk.

354
00:21:36,699 --> 00:21:38,599
So, fine, he's a goose.

355
00:21:38,634 --> 00:21:40,601
Maybe we can negotiate a price,

356
00:21:40,636 --> 00:21:42,503
- pay them off.
- Yeah.

357
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:45,440
Yes. Caution is wise.

358
00:21:45,474 --> 00:21:48,309
The Falcone clan still
is number one, after all.

359
00:21:48,344 --> 00:21:50,411
Paying them off is the safe thing to do.

360
00:21:50,446 --> 00:21:51,946
Screw safe.

361
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,382
They want to push me?
They think I'm gonna fold?

362
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,950
I'll push right back, harder.

363
00:21:55,984 --> 00:21:58,953
Hit them where it hurts. Today.

364
00:21:58,987 --> 00:22:00,388
You know best.

365
00:22:00,422 --> 00:22:02,523
If that's how you want to play it,

366
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:05,626
I think I know just the spot to hit them.

367
00:22:17,405 --> 00:22:18,839
I owe you an apology.

368
00:22:18,873 --> 00:22:21,842
You were telling the truth,
and I wouldn't believe you.

369
00:22:21,876 --> 00:22:23,410
Maybe my personal feelings towards Barbara

370
00:22:23,444 --> 00:22:25,045
got tangled up in there.

371
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,147
- And that was wrong.
- Forget it.

372
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:28,915
Anyhow, I-I'm sorry for misjudging you,

373
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,585
and I'm very glad that
we're on the same side now.

374
00:22:35,456 --> 00:22:38,358
Yeah, me, too.

375
00:22:40,134 --> 00:22:41,768
So Barbara's safe though?

376
00:22:41,802 --> 00:22:43,403
You're sure she's safe?

377
00:22:43,437 --> 00:22:46,372
I'm sure.

378
00:22:50,444 --> 00:22:52,078
Gordon, is that you?!

379
00:22:54,115 --> 00:22:55,181
It's all right, Alfred.

380
00:22:55,216 --> 00:22:56,583
It's all right. He's a friend.

381
00:22:56,617 --> 00:22:57,851
We couldn't risk a direct approach;

382
00:22:57,885 --> 00:22:59,018
there's people looking for me.

383
00:22:59,053 --> 00:23:01,054
Ah, right.

384
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,289
Sorry about that, mate.

385
00:23:03,324 --> 00:23:05,058
Can't be too careful.

386
00:23:07,128 --> 00:23:09,429
In a spot of bother, are we, sir?

387
00:23:11,065 --> 00:23:14,033
Renee Montoya and Crispus Allen.

388
00:23:14,068 --> 00:23:17,303
Pleased to meet you.

389
00:23:17,338 --> 00:23:20,440
Bruce, I promised I would
find your parents' killer.

390
00:23:20,474 --> 00:23:23,209
I'm not sure I'm going to
be able to keep that promise.

391
00:23:23,244 --> 00:23:26,212
It's a long story, but I'm
kind of in a tight spot.

392
00:23:26,247 --> 00:23:28,148
I've upset some powerful people.

393
00:23:28,182 --> 00:23:30,116
Stop treating me like a child.

394
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:33,286
Explain.

395
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,655
Bruce, you are a child.
You don't need to know...

396
00:23:35,689 --> 00:23:36,790
You expect to die!

397
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,993
I'd like to know why.

398
00:23:41,762 --> 00:23:44,164
Is it connected to my parents' murder?

399
00:23:44,198 --> 00:23:46,866
Yes, it's all connected.

400
00:23:48,335 --> 00:23:50,303
Somehow.

401
00:23:50,337 --> 00:23:53,139
Bruce...

402
00:23:53,174 --> 00:23:55,608
I will do my best to work this thing out.

403
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:57,143
But if I don't,

404
00:23:57,178 --> 00:24:01,014
Montoya and Allen here will
take over your parents' case.

405
00:24:01,048 --> 00:24:02,349
I've told them everything I know.

406
00:24:02,383 --> 00:24:04,517
You can trust them, one hundred percent.

407
00:24:04,552 --> 00:24:05,885
One hundred percent.

408
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:13,093
Bruce, these are good detectives.

409
00:24:13,127 --> 00:24:16,229
If anyone can find the truth, it's them.

410
00:24:23,404 --> 00:24:25,171
Thank you.

411
00:24:26,627 --> 00:24:28,875
Sir, what can we do to help you now?

412
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:30,543
Nothing.

413
00:24:30,578 --> 00:24:32,646
From here on in, I have to go it alone.

414
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,481
I don't want anyone else caught up in this.

415
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:37,851
- I have to go.
- You can hardly walk.

416
00:24:37,885 --> 00:24:40,687
I'll be fine.

417
00:25:11,285 --> 00:25:13,720
This way.

418
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,257
Not much further.

419
00:25:24,465 --> 00:25:25,465
It's there.

420
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:02,269
Told you.

421
00:26:02,303 --> 00:26:04,104
Easy as pie.

422
00:26:04,138 --> 00:26:06,239
There must be a million
dollars' worth here.

423
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:08,232
Yeah, you told us, all right.

424
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,778
You're clever.

425
00:26:11,812 --> 00:26:14,481
You're very clever.

426
00:26:14,515 --> 00:26:17,384
I sense a sarcastic and
hostile edge to your tone.

427
00:26:17,418 --> 00:26:18,618
Hostile?

428
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,288
You got that right.

429
00:26:21,322 --> 00:26:24,658
You ain't no golden goose,
you're a yellow rat snitch,

430
00:26:24,692 --> 00:26:26,927
and you got Maroni all twisted.

431
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:29,963
I'm so glad we're finally
clearing the air at last.

432
00:26:29,997 --> 00:26:31,464
That's it.

433
00:26:31,499 --> 00:26:33,266
Act smart, okay?

434
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:35,468
'Cause all I got to do right now

435
00:26:35,503 --> 00:26:37,904
is put a bullet in your brain right here.

436
00:26:37,939 --> 00:26:39,406
Bang.

437
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,441
See, then I go back and I tell the boss

438
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:42,909
that one of Niko's men shot you.

439
00:26:42,944 --> 00:26:44,311
Gee, that's too bad.

440
00:26:44,345 --> 00:26:45,645
End of story.

441
00:26:48,216 --> 00:26:50,817
Yes, that's clever enough.

442
00:26:50,852 --> 00:26:54,120
I never doubted your intelligence.

443
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:55,589
That's not your problem.

444
00:26:55,623 --> 00:26:58,658
Oh, I got a problem, huh? I got a problem.

445
00:26:58,693 --> 00:27:00,460
No, you got a problem.

446
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:01,761
What's my problem, schmo?

447
00:27:01,796 --> 00:27:03,697
What drives you?

448
00:27:03,731 --> 00:27:06,099
What's your passion?

449
00:27:06,133 --> 00:27:09,669
When you know what a man loves,

450
00:27:09,704 --> 00:27:11,972
you know what can kill him.

451
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:14,674
Do you believe this guy?

452
00:27:14,709 --> 00:27:16,810
For you, it's money.

453
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,645
You love money.

454
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,982
More than power and respect.

455
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:24,818
You're a skinflint, Mr. Carbone.

456
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:28,688
A cheapskate.

457
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,792
What are you guys playing at? Let me go!

458
00:27:32,827 --> 00:27:34,461
Sorry, Frankie.

459
00:27:34,495 --> 00:27:37,197
- As I say, a cheapskate.
- Hey, come on!

460
00:27:37,231 --> 00:27:39,166
Hey... Consequently,

461
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,301
you don't pay your people enough.

462
00:27:41,335 --> 00:27:43,303
No, you know me. You don't wanna do this.

463
00:27:43,337 --> 00:27:46,473
- It is a sad fact...
- You don't want to do this.

464
00:27:46,507 --> 00:27:48,241
No. No. No, no!

465
00:27:48,276 --> 00:27:50,243
That there is no loyalty among thieves.

466
00:27:55,283 --> 00:27:58,084
The simple offer of a substantial pay raise

467
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:00,921
is all it took to sway these fine men.

468
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:06,726
So, you see, that's your problem!

469
00:28:06,761 --> 00:28:08,895
Your greatest passion

470
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,731
becomes your greatest weakness!

471
00:28:21,876 --> 00:28:25,212
Love, Mr. Carbone.

472
00:28:27,882 --> 00:28:29,883
Love conquers all.

473
00:28:32,453 --> 00:28:34,454
Shh.

474
00:28:56,941 --> 00:28:58,542
My friend.

475
00:28:58,576 --> 00:29:01,812
My good friend, today is a sad day.

476
00:29:01,846 --> 00:29:04,075
Nikolai was like a son to me,

477
00:29:04,366 --> 00:29:06,818
just as Frankie was a son to you.

478
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:09,415
We both lost precious family members.

479
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:13,048
- My condolences to you.
- And mine to you.

480
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:15,288
I want this violence to stop.

481
00:29:15,748 --> 00:29:17,561
Business is good.

482
00:29:17,595 --> 00:29:19,830
The Arkham Project is a gold mine.

483
00:29:19,864 --> 00:29:22,466
Wayne Enterprises is back in play.

484
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,034
Life is good for all of us.

485
00:29:24,068 --> 00:29:27,904
Why risk all of that and
go to war over trifles?

486
00:29:27,939 --> 00:29:32,509
Your little man there is
obviously very valuable to you.

487
00:29:32,543 --> 00:29:34,244
We'll let you have him.

488
00:29:34,278 --> 00:29:37,881
Unharmed. Our gift to you.

489
00:29:37,915 --> 00:29:39,549
And as a show of

490
00:29:39,584 --> 00:29:42,986
mutual respect, you give
us something in return.

491
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,856
Like such as what?

492
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:48,225
How about real estate?

493
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:51,094
One of your warehouses on the river maybe.

494
00:29:51,129 --> 00:29:52,996
That's not gonna work.

495
00:29:53,031 --> 00:29:54,398
I mean, I like this fella,

496
00:29:54,432 --> 00:29:58,201
but we're talking about
a warehouse on the river.

497
00:30:02,907 --> 00:30:04,508
Yeah.

498
00:30:04,542 --> 00:30:06,710
Indian Hill.

499
00:30:06,744 --> 00:30:09,112
I'll give you Indian Hill.

500
00:30:09,147 --> 00:30:11,615
I'm not familiar with the name.

501
00:30:11,649 --> 00:30:13,050
It's in Arkham.

502
00:30:13,084 --> 00:30:14,785
It's a toxic waste dump

503
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:16,753
on top of an Indian burial ground.

504
00:30:16,788 --> 00:30:18,288
It's worthless.

505
00:30:18,322 --> 00:30:19,756
No.

506
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:22,125
Nothing is worthless.

507
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,727
Even nothing is worth something.

508
00:30:23,761 --> 00:30:25,028
We'll take it.

509
00:30:25,063 --> 00:30:28,031
As a token of our mutual respect, yes?

510
00:30:28,066 --> 00:30:29,866
You got it, my friend.

511
00:30:29,901 --> 00:30:32,469
It's all love.

512
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:36,807
It's a pleasure seeing you all.

513
00:30:38,342 --> 00:30:41,545
Um, I heard Vic Zsasz tore up the GCPD,

514
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:43,146
tracking down Gordon.

515
00:30:43,181 --> 00:30:44,915
Did you catch him yet?

516
00:30:44,949 --> 00:30:46,917
We're working on it.

517
00:30:46,951 --> 00:30:48,552
Well, good luck with that.

518
00:30:48,586 --> 00:30:51,521
There's nothing more dangerous
than an honest man, huh?

519
00:31:16,647 --> 00:31:18,448
Jimbo, it's me. Open up.

520
00:31:21,185 --> 00:31:22,552
Hey.

521
00:31:22,587 --> 00:31:24,321
Don't worry, I'm not gonna kill you.

522
00:31:24,355 --> 00:31:26,323
I should, but I ain't.

523
00:31:26,357 --> 00:31:28,058
Glad to hear it.

524
00:31:28,092 --> 00:31:30,660
Obviously, you figured you'd go
to the last place they'd look,

525
00:31:30,695 --> 00:31:32,362
because it'd be the
first place they'd reject

526
00:31:32,396 --> 00:31:33,430
as being too obvious.

527
00:31:33,464 --> 00:31:36,032
I-I'm sorry, I'm being rude.

528
00:31:36,067 --> 00:31:38,068
This is the Duchess of Devonshire.

529
00:31:38,102 --> 00:31:40,337
Duchess, Jim Gordon, putz.

530
00:31:40,371 --> 00:31:41,471
Marsha. Hi.

531
00:31:41,506 --> 00:31:43,306
Right.

532
00:31:43,341 --> 00:31:44,875
Baby, why don't you explore a little bit.

533
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:46,910
Find the bedroom, put
on your birthday suit.

534
00:31:48,146 --> 00:31:51,948
And I'll find you in a jiffy, okay? Hmm?

535
00:31:51,983 --> 00:31:53,650
So I've been thinking.

536
00:31:53,684 --> 00:31:55,352
You're still a douche bag.

537
00:31:55,386 --> 00:31:56,853
But you have the moral high ground.

538
00:31:56,888 --> 00:31:58,155
So I'm gonna back your play,

539
00:31:58,189 --> 00:31:59,156
whatever it is.

540
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,724
I figure I'm doomed anyhow.

541
00:32:00,758 --> 00:32:02,893
I might as well join the good guys.

542
00:32:02,927 --> 00:32:04,661
Thank you.

543
00:32:04,695 --> 00:32:05,896
So what is your play?

544
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,631
I mean, you got one,
right? You said you did.

545
00:32:07,665 --> 00:32:10,233
Tomorrow morning, I'm
arresting Falcone and the mayor

546
00:32:10,268 --> 00:32:12,702
for the framing of Mario Pepper.

547
00:32:12,737 --> 00:32:15,372
Conspiracy, POJ, Rico, the works.

548
00:32:15,406 --> 00:32:17,741
Well, that's a... that's a hell of a plan.

549
00:32:17,775 --> 00:32:19,142
You sit down with a panel of chimpanzees

550
00:32:19,177 --> 00:32:21,645
and a bucket of crack
and come up with that one?

551
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,147
I figure whatever else
happens, we'll stir things up.

552
00:32:24,182 --> 00:32:25,549
We might even make the papers.

553
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:27,083
Oh, yeah, we're gonna
make the papers, all right.

554
00:32:27,118 --> 00:32:28,685
We're gonna be dead in the streets

555
00:32:28,719 --> 00:32:30,487
in time for the evening edition.

556
00:32:30,521 --> 00:32:32,255
Well, at least the people
will know the truth.

557
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,890
And we'll go out doing our jobs,

558
00:32:33,925 --> 00:32:35,192
enforcing the law.

559
00:32:35,226 --> 00:32:37,093
That's the best
inspirational speech you got?

560
00:32:37,128 --> 00:32:38,595
Doing our jobs?

561
00:32:38,629 --> 00:32:41,064
- You don't have to join me.
- No, I'm game.

562
00:32:41,098 --> 00:32:42,833
Like I said, I'm doomed anyhow.

563
00:32:42,867 --> 00:32:45,735
Now, if you'll excuse me for one minute,

564
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:48,405
just gonna take care of some business.

565
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:49,773
Duchess!

566
00:32:51,642 --> 00:32:53,543
Marco!

567
00:32:53,578 --> 00:32:55,445
Polo!

568
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,923
Jumping catfish.

569
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:14,625
Good morning, Mayor James.

570
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,959
Gordon, you scared...

571
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,494
scared the bejeebers out of me.

572
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:18,929
Almost spilled my coffee.

573
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:20,164
Sorry.

574
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:21,432
Sir, you're under arrest.

575
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:22,766
That's not funny.

576
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:25,169
Depends where you're sitting.

577
00:33:28,111 --> 00:33:29,861
Might want to take a look at this.

578
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:44,189
How you doing, guys?

579
00:33:44,223 --> 00:33:46,191
I'm here to have a chat with Mr. Falcone.

580
00:33:46,225 --> 00:33:48,160
Sure thing, Mr. Mayor.

581
00:34:10,283 --> 00:34:12,951
Carmine Falcone, you're under arrest.

582
00:34:12,986 --> 00:34:15,454
Move.

583
00:34:16,556 --> 00:34:19,091
Lie down right over there. Stay quiet.

584
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:21,393
What on earth are you thinking?

585
00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:22,961
We're thinking we'll take you both to jail

586
00:34:22,996 --> 00:34:24,930
and charge you with conspiracy

587
00:34:24,964 --> 00:34:27,132
- to pervert the course of justice.
- Try and take me in,

588
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:28,967
you won't make it to the end of the street.

589
00:34:29,002 --> 00:34:30,802
That's exactly what I said.

590
00:34:30,837 --> 00:34:33,105
This is a lawful arrest. If
you resist, you will be shot.

591
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:34,506
I see.

592
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:37,342
We all die together in a blaze of glory.

593
00:34:37,377 --> 00:34:38,977
If that's how it works
out, that's fine with me.

594
00:34:39,012 --> 00:34:40,245
How about you, Harvey?

595
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,580
Fine by me.

596
00:34:41,614 --> 00:34:43,749
- Oh, God.
- I envy you boys.

597
00:34:43,783 --> 00:34:46,485
Having nothing to lose must be liberating.

598
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,120
Must feel pretty good.

599
00:34:48,154 --> 00:34:49,588
Yes, it does.

600
00:34:49,622 --> 00:34:50,622
Suppose you did have something to lose.

601
00:34:50,657 --> 00:34:51,623
What would you do then?

602
00:34:51,658 --> 00:34:53,325
Suppose, for instance,

603
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,828
I had a knife to Barbara
Kean's throat right now.

604
00:34:56,863 --> 00:34:58,530
Would you still be so brave?

605
00:34:58,564 --> 00:34:59,598
You don't.

606
00:34:59,632 --> 00:35:01,099
I'm telling you I do.

607
00:35:01,134 --> 00:35:02,434
You're a liar.

608
00:35:02,468 --> 00:35:06,038
I have many faults, but I'm not a liar.

609
00:35:06,072 --> 00:35:08,340
Victor Zsasz has Barbara.

610
00:35:08,374 --> 00:35:10,042
You know Victor.

611
00:35:12,045 --> 00:35:13,545
You're lying. She's far away.

612
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,113
She came back.

613
00:35:15,148 --> 00:35:17,482
Came right to me to plead for your life.

614
00:35:17,517 --> 00:35:19,618
You have a good woman there.

615
00:35:19,652 --> 00:35:21,687
She loves you very much.

616
00:35:21,721 --> 00:35:23,522
Too much.

617
00:35:25,425 --> 00:35:27,559
Prove it.

618
00:35:27,594 --> 00:35:29,027
Prove you have her.

619
00:35:29,062 --> 00:35:30,829
I could.

620
00:35:30,863 --> 00:35:32,531
But I won't.

621
00:35:32,565 --> 00:35:35,067
I want you to believe me.

622
00:35:36,536 --> 00:35:37,736
It's obvious, Jim. He's lying.

623
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,471
Am I?

624
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:41,673
If you think so,

625
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:44,209
go ahead and try to bring me in.

626
00:35:44,244 --> 00:35:45,811
You'll be dead,

627
00:35:45,845 --> 00:35:48,513
so you won't know what happens to Barbara.

628
00:35:48,548 --> 00:35:50,382
But it won't be pretty.

629
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:51,583
Lying.

630
00:35:51,618 --> 00:35:54,019
On my mother's grave.

631
00:35:54,053 --> 00:35:56,321
Drop your gun,

632
00:35:56,356 --> 00:35:58,757
and Barbara won't be harmed in any way.

633
00:36:03,563 --> 00:36:05,530
Those muffins smell good.

634
00:36:05,565 --> 00:36:08,333
None for you, creep.

635
00:36:08,368 --> 00:36:11,136
She can have one if she wants.

636
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:14,339
No, thank you.

637
00:36:29,088 --> 00:36:30,556
Got it.

638
00:36:36,796 --> 00:36:38,397
What a shame.

639
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,801
Oh, this is embarrassing; he straight-up

640
00:36:42,835 --> 00:36:44,570
bluffed you into folding.

641
00:36:44,604 --> 00:36:46,738
We could've gone out like
heroes; now we're fish food.

642
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,611
Okay, so it wasn't a bluff.

643
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,080
I'm sorry if she was

644
00:36:55,114 --> 00:36:56,748
mistreated a little. We needed to be

645
00:36:56,783 --> 00:36:59,051
sure she had nothing useful to tell us.

646
00:36:59,085 --> 00:37:00,319
Untie her, Victor.

647
00:37:02,856 --> 00:37:04,089
I'm sorry.

648
00:37:04,123 --> 00:37:06,091
It's okay. It's okay.

649
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:07,826
What am I gonna do with you?

650
00:37:07,861 --> 00:37:10,729
By rights, you have to die.

651
00:37:10,763 --> 00:37:12,998
Whoa, hello. Uh, I'm late for work.

652
00:37:14,601 --> 00:37:16,468
Quite an adventure. I'll be on my way.

653
00:37:17,504 --> 00:37:19,137
Such a waste though.

654
00:37:19,172 --> 00:37:21,573
Gotham needs men like you, both of you.

655
00:37:21,608 --> 00:37:23,976
Strong men with principles.

656
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,310
I wish I could make you see

657
00:37:25,345 --> 00:37:26,945
I'm not the enemy.

658
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,780
The system is not the enemy.

659
00:37:28,815 --> 00:37:30,949
The enemy is anarchy.

660
00:37:30,984 --> 00:37:34,019
But I told you that before, didn't I, Jim?

661
00:37:34,053 --> 00:37:35,487
Yes, you did.

662
00:37:35,522 --> 00:37:37,756
You didn't listen though.

663
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:40,792
Do we get a last meal or a
smoke or anything, or just talk?

664
00:37:40,827 --> 00:37:43,162
But today, you believed me.

665
00:37:43,196 --> 00:37:45,097
You trusted my word.

666
00:37:45,131 --> 00:37:47,866
That's a good first step.

667
00:37:47,901 --> 00:37:49,735
Perhaps there's still hope for you.

668
00:37:56,476 --> 00:37:58,477
Yes.

669
00:37:58,511 --> 00:38:00,946
Go. Get out of here
before I change my mind.

670
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,748
- Wait a minute.
- Quiet.

671
00:38:06,986 --> 00:38:08,487
It's been a pleasure, Barbara.

672
00:38:08,521 --> 00:38:10,923
I do admire a brave woman.

673
00:38:12,892 --> 00:38:14,259
What's the catch?

674
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:16,028
Jim, he said we could
go. Let's not haggle here.

675
00:38:16,062 --> 00:38:18,864
What's the catch, Mr. Falcone?

676
00:38:18,898 --> 00:38:21,700
I want you to think about what I said.

677
00:38:21,734 --> 00:38:25,337
I want you to understand the truth.

678
00:38:25,371 --> 00:38:26,738
That's all I ask.

679
00:38:26,773 --> 00:38:29,274
The catch is...

680
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:31,877
someday soon, you'll see I'm right.

681
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,830
Barbara...

682
00:38:51,865 --> 00:38:53,832
I'm sorry.

683
00:38:53,867 --> 00:38:57,669
I was just trying to help, and...

684
00:38:57,704 --> 00:38:59,872
I don't know what...

685
00:39:05,745 --> 00:39:07,146
I love you so much.

686
00:39:24,164 --> 00:39:25,397
Mmm.

687
00:39:25,432 --> 00:39:26,699
Excellent.

688
00:39:26,733 --> 00:39:27,966
Delicious!

689
00:39:28,001 --> 00:39:29,234
Yes.

690
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:30,803
I followed the recipe.

691
00:39:30,837 --> 00:39:32,738
You're right, Mr. F., cooking is easy.

692
00:39:34,474 --> 00:39:37,142
I'm sorry you had to see all that earlier.

693
00:39:37,177 --> 00:39:39,311
Not pleasant.

694
00:39:39,345 --> 00:39:42,114
I understand. Business is business.

695
00:39:42,148 --> 00:39:43,348
Mm-hmm.

696
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:45,818
Yes, it is.

697
00:39:45,852 --> 00:39:48,520
I'll go see to the chickens.

698
00:39:55,528 --> 00:39:57,529
Any eggs, my dears?

699
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:09,608
Don Falcone.

700
00:40:14,948 --> 00:40:16,348
My friend.

701
00:40:16,383 --> 00:40:17,983
Good to see you.

702
00:40:18,018 --> 00:40:19,485
I was just thinking

703
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:21,487
about the night we met.

704
00:40:26,226 --> 00:40:29,028
Cut them down.

705
00:40:31,231 --> 00:40:32,364
Where's the snitch?

706
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:34,166
I want to speak to him.

707
00:40:38,371 --> 00:40:41,240
Cobblepot, is it?

708
00:40:44,344 --> 00:40:47,379
Condemned men are honest men, I find.

709
00:40:47,414 --> 00:40:50,149
What can you tell me before you go?

710
00:40:57,223 --> 00:40:58,524
Don Falcone.

711
00:40:58,558 --> 00:41:00,626
It is a great honor, sir.

712
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:05,331
Indeed, I can tell a secret
of great value to you...

713
00:41:05,365 --> 00:41:07,633
if you grant me one last request.

714
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:09,468
Which is what?

715
00:41:11,037 --> 00:41:13,339
Give the job of killing me to James Gordon.

716
00:41:13,373 --> 00:41:15,841
Why him?

717
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:17,876
He's the only man under your sway

718
00:41:17,911 --> 00:41:19,311
who has a conscience.

719
00:41:19,346 --> 00:41:21,180
The only one who might be persuaded

720
00:41:21,214 --> 00:41:22,381
to spare my life.

721
00:41:22,415 --> 00:41:24,850
Why would I agree to that?

722
00:41:24,884 --> 00:41:26,685
I want you dead. You're a snitch.

723
00:41:28,188 --> 00:41:31,990
If you agree and Gordon spares me,

724
00:41:32,025 --> 00:41:33,859
then I will become your snitch.

725
00:41:33,893 --> 00:41:36,261
For life.

726
00:41:36,296 --> 00:41:39,231
I will come back to Gotham
under a different name,

727
00:41:39,265 --> 00:41:41,500
and I will work my way
into the Moroni family,

728
00:41:41,534 --> 00:41:43,035
and I will snitch for you.

729
00:41:43,069 --> 00:41:45,738
I am excellent at this sort of work.

730
00:41:45,772 --> 00:41:47,373
I have a gift for it.

731
00:41:47,407 --> 00:41:49,708
I really do, sir.

732
00:42:02,555 --> 00:42:03,922
Deal.

733
00:42:03,957 --> 00:42:06,792
Gordon will get the job of killing you.

734
00:42:08,561 --> 00:42:10,696
Thank you, sir.

735
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:14,600
What is the valuable secret?

736
00:42:14,634 --> 00:42:17,736
Oh, yes.

737
00:42:17,771 --> 00:42:19,238
Fish Mooney and Nikolai the Russian

738
00:42:19,272 --> 00:42:21,940
only pretend to hate each other.

739
00:42:21,975 --> 00:42:23,409
They're lovers.

740
00:42:23,443 --> 00:42:25,778
And Fish is pushing Nikolai

741
00:42:25,812 --> 00:42:27,813
to take your place.

742
00:42:29,816 --> 00:42:31,216
Is that so?

743
00:42:31,251 --> 00:42:32,451
Yes, sir.

744
00:42:32,485 --> 00:42:35,754
But only so Fish can take over from him.

745
00:42:40,093 --> 00:42:42,094
That is a good secret.

746
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:46,265
It's almost uncanny.

747
00:42:46,299 --> 00:42:49,601
Everything played out
exactly as you said it would.

748
00:42:49,636 --> 00:42:52,237
We got rid of Nikolai painlessly,

749
00:42:52,272 --> 00:42:54,272
and Maroni thinks you're a wizard.

750
00:42:54,748 --> 00:42:56,269
You really do have a gift.

751
00:42:58,211 --> 00:43:00,997
But I think we're making a
mistake letting Gordon live.

752
00:43:01,872 --> 00:43:03,010
He's trouble.

753
00:43:03,713 --> 00:43:05,847
Thank you so much for sparing him.

754
00:43:06,627 --> 00:43:08,262
I appreciate the favor.

755
00:43:08,856 --> 00:43:11,041
Don't worry.

756
00:43:11,591 --> 00:43:12,894
He'll see the light.

757
00:43:13,686 --> 00:43:16,037
One way or another, I guarantee it.

758
00:43:21,303 --> 00:43:27,009
