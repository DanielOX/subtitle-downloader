1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,203
Previously, on Gotham:
I start a new job
in the morning.

2
00:00:04,205 --> 00:00:05,404
A new job?! Congratulations!

3
00:00:05,406 --> 00:00:07,539
I'm coming to work
at the GCPD.

4
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:09,375
I'm your new
medical examiner.

5
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:11,610
I have some questions I need to
ask the members of the board.

6
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:13,545
What kind of questions?
About Arkham.

7
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,347
It seems very likely
those gangsters

8
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:16,715
are actually given
their shares in Arkham

9
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:18,450
by Wayne Enterprises.

10
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:20,652
This nightclub makes
a lot of money.

11
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:23,088
That's why I want to
re-open it under your care.

12
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,656
I can have the club?

13
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:25,958
You're with me now.

14
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,993
What is this place?
Where are we?

15
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:30,295
Some people think it's a
prison, some think it's Hell.

16
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:32,965
They took my eyes.

17
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:34,366
People call him Mace.

18
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,734
He's the one in charge.

19
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:37,069

20
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,638
Ah!

21
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,273
My name is Fish Mooney.

22
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:43,542
I'm in charge now.

23
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,780

Jim?

48
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:31,783
Hi.

49
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,289
Where's Jim?

50
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,559
He dropped off his keys,
like, last week.

51
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,803
So screw him anyway, right?

52
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,479
So who are you guys?

53
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,650

54
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,725

Show them your appreciation!

Thank you from
the Flying Graysons!

Calm down, now.
Calm down! Stop that!

Come on!

68
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,756
Stop it! Calm down!

00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,460
Ladies, come on!
I hate you!

Get off, you old bag.

78
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:57,496
You...

79
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,006

81
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:21,453
Why did you attack
Mr. Grayson?

82
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:22,654
No reason.

83
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:24,956
I don't like him.

84
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,527
I have no idea why he did it.

85
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,064
Beats me.

86
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,673
Wow, you circus people
don't mess around, do you?

87
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,875
I swear, John Grayson,

88
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,410
if you give me
that look one more time,

89
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:46,545
I will slap you silly.

90
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:47,579
You wish.

91
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:48,580
Don't think I can't.

92
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:49,948
Whoa, kids.

93
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,817
What's the big problem,
anyhow?

94
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,518
The Graysons are a bunch
of arrogant buttheads

95
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,721
is the problem.
The Lloyds are feckless
drunkards,

96
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:57,356
is more like it.

97
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:58,990
So it's a family feud.

98
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,592
Graysons don't
get along with Lloyds.

99
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:02,561
Been that way for years.

100
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:03,862
It's sort of a tradition.

101
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,664
You guys fight like this
every night?

102
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,299
No.

103
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:09,601
That was just her idiot uncle
doing his thing.

104
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:11,536
You know damn well
it must be Lila's fault.

105
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,005
Mary...
What?

106
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,712
Hey.

107
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,681
Sorry the date went south.

108
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:23,749
Are you kidding?

109
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:24,750
Best date ever.

110
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:26,385
Who gets to see a circus brawl?

111
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:27,552
True.

112
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,388
None of them will talk,
of course.

113
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,656
so I've no idea what
those two were fighting over.

114
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:33,592
I think they're rival lovers.

115
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:35,861
Their families have been
fighting since way back,

116
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:37,529
but this particular fight was

117
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:39,498
apparently over
a woman named Lila.

118
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,334
She's a snake dancer
in the sideshow.

119
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:43,769
Wow.
I know.

120
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:45,470
How cool is that?
A snake dancer.

121
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,606
No, I mean, wow,
you're really good.

122
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:50,342
People talk to doctors.
I guess so.

123
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:52,043
I should find this woman
Lila, make sure she's okay.

124
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,578
Might take little awhile.

125
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,713
I'll have a patrolman
drive you home.

126
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:57,516
Oh... I could come with you.

127
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:59,751
Lee, this is police business.

128
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,887
Come on, Jim.

129
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:03,088
I'm dying to meet Lila.

130
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,589

131
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,592
Well, bringing along
medical personnel

132
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:08,794
is a justifiable precaution,

133
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,595
I guess.
There you go.

134
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:14,966
Sir... where's Lila?

135
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,368
Lila?

136
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,470
The Snake Dancer.

137
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,079

138
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,052
GCPD.

139
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,454
We need to speak with Lila.

140
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:37,622
She's not here.

141
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,024
Why? What's happened?

142
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:40,459
Where is she?

143
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:43,094
Uh, I don't know.

144
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:44,696
She was supposed to
be home ages ago.

145
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:45,730
You a relative?

146
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:48,033
Uh, I'm her son-- Jerome.

147
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:50,702
Jerome, when did you
last see her?

148
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:52,671
This morning.

149
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:54,573
She was here when I
left for the library.

150
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:56,875
Relax, Jerome,
this gentleman is just here

151
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:58,577
because Owen and Al
had a disagreement.

152
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:01,847
Your mother's fine,
gone on a spree, no doubt.

153
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:03,949
You know how she is.
A spree?

154
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:07,152
Without her hat,
her coat or her purse?

155
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,922
And look at Sheba.

156
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:12,424
She's distraught.

157
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:13,692
She knows
something's wrong.

158
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:15,961
The snake does seem
to be agitated.

159
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:18,129
Sir...

160
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,698
she's what you call
a party girl.

161
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,533
Back in the morning
with her knickers

162
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,568
in a handbag, sure as eggs.

163
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,904
But she didn't take
her handbag, did she?

164
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:30,108
How fast does an animal
like that move?

165
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,611
Oh, fast walking pace.

166
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,946
They rely on
surprise, mainly.

167
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,615
Let her out.

168
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:38,917
I'm sorry?

169
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,152
Let her out.

170
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,952
♪ ♪

171
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,936
Oh! Oh...

172
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,941
Oh, my God.

173
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:38,743

174
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,780

175
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,685
You knew.

176
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:48,687
You knew she was here.

177
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,021
No.

178
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:51,723
Look at me.

179
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,963
She was like that
when we found her.

180
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,940
Let's talk straight.

181
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,176
Those people out there

182
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:13,278
are using us
as transplant donors.

183
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,915
We are simply spare parts.

184
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,818
Unless...

185
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,520
unless we do something about it.

186
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:25,123
How?

187
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,524
I have a plan.

188
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:29,761
But you must do
exactly what I say.

189
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,263
You do as I say,
and I promise you,

190
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,399
I will get some of us
out of here alive.

191
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:35,500
That's right.

192
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:38,269
No, you heard me correctly.

193
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:42,007
I said,some...of us.

194
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:46,578
Because the truth of the
matter is some will die.

195
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,016
But we will die with dignity.

196
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,118
We will die for a reason,

197
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,353
and we will die next to family,

198
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:58,189
and I tell you what--
we are family.

199
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:01,192
We're all we got.

200
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:04,195
That's family!

201
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:07,165
We have one simple choice:

202
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,402
we die here alone on our knees

203
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:15,006
or we stand up and we fight
with our family!

204
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,641

205
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:27,986
A couple of riggers
found her right here.

206
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,854
We decided to hide her
on the truck.

207
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,289
We were going to give her

208
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,525
a proper burial as soon as
we got back on the road.

209
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,427
Decent of you.

210
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:37,095
Who's "we"?
Who else knew?

211
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:38,830
Just me and the head
of the families.

212
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:41,533
If an outsider killed her,
what can you do?

213
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:42,967
An act of God.

214
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,003
If it was one of us,

215
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:46,938
we always find out.

216
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,973
And we make sure
they're punished.

217
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,208
How?

218
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,243
We have our ways.

219
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:54,112
And we have ours.

220
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:55,380
Hook him up.

221
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,448

222
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,362
Morning, partner.

223
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,031
Gonna need a little help here.

224
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,299
No kidding.

225
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:15,867
I mean, you're kidding, right?

226
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:19,070
This isn't
an elaborate prank or...?

227
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,511
Tell me about
your mother, Jerome.

228
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,216
She's my mother.

229
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:33,051
What can I say? I love her.

230
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,487
She's perfect.

231
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,490
Not a very good cook.

232
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:41,493
Except for that...

233
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:43,428
Did she have any enemies?

234
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,896
Someone with a grudge?

235
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:47,966
No.

236
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:49,634
Boyfriends?

237
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:50,635
No.

238
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:52,971
No?

239
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:55,673
She had lovers.

240
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:59,444
They're sex partners
really, but not boyfriends.

241
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,079
She didn't want the commitment.

242
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,280
Alphonse Grayson?

243
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,581
Yes, he was one of them.

244
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,150
Owen Lloyd?

245
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:07,685
Yes.

246
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:08,686
Any others?

247
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:11,956
Not that I could put a name to.

248
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:16,561
How do you feel about
your mother's love life?

249
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:20,298
I feel fine about it.

250
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,133
If not for
my mother's love life,

251
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,535
I wouldn't be here, would I?

252
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,370
Sex is

253
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,105
a healthy human activity.

254
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:29,040
Yes, it is.

255
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,944
Do you have any other family?

256
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:36,681
The circus is my family.

257
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:41,019
One more time. Why did
you assault Mr. Grayson?

258
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,053
You know why.

259
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:43,721
Tell me.
He killed Lila.

260
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,957
Why would he do that?

261
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,258
She was gonna choose me
over him,

262
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,593
and he's an arrogant
son of a bitch.

263
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:50,028
Not gonna let a Lloyd

264
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,463
humiliate a Grayson that way.

265
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,032
How come your families
don't get along?

266
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:56,467
His great-grandfather
falsely accused

267
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:59,470
my mother's uncle Barry
of stealing a horse.

268
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:00,471
When was this?

269
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:01,739
Before the Great War.

270
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,341
World War One.

271
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,576
Yeah.

272
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:06,444
For three generations,

273
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,646
your families have been feuding
over a stolen horse?

274
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,448
Yes. And the Lloyds
are still trash.

275
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,549
Blood is blood.

276
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,051
Must be a hell
of a horse.

277
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,686
Why did Mr. Lloyd
assault you?

278
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,689
He killed Lila, and fears
I'm gonna kill him for it.

279
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,157
He says the opposite.

280
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,758
He says you killed her.

281
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,995
Yes, I suppose he would
have to say that, wouldn't he?

282
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:25,330
It wasn't Uncle Owen.

283
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:27,131
He could never do
such a terrible thing.

284
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,132
Holy crap, Mary!

285
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:29,667
How can you be so blind?

286
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,269
Quiet, you.

287
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,403
Yeah, quiet, you.

288
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:33,504
You're the blind one.

289
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:34,539
My brother is a man of honor.

290
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,241
Your uncle is
a violent drunk.

291
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:38,443
Do the math, little girl.
My uncle is an artist.

292
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:41,279
Your brother is a conceited
muscle-head, like the rest

293
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:42,413
of you flying douche bags.

294
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:43,681
I can't believe I ever thought

295
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:44,682
I loved you.

296
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,451
Enough. Huh?

297
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,029


298
00:14:58,031 --> 00:14:59,230
They're coming.

299
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,498
Are you ready?

300
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,066
Yes!

301
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,035
I said, are you ready?!

302
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:05,870
Yes!

303
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:12,243
Inmate 57A, raise your hand.

304
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,780
57A...

305
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:17,815
raise your hand.

306
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,855
Step forward.

307
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,828
One moment, please, sir.

308
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,400
We need to talk.

309
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,674
Back up, inmate.

310
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:44,342
You're in violation.

311
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:45,476
57A,

312
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:47,378
step forward!

313
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,380
Excuse me one moment, please.

314
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:51,382
I'm the new "shot caller" here.

315
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:52,984
My name is Fish Mooney,

316
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,987
and with all due
respect, for you and I

317
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:58,356
to have a good
working relationship,

318
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:00,458
there's some things
that need to change.

319
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,726
Is that right?

320
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:02,961
What's your name?

321
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,430
None of your damn business
what my name is.

322
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,932
Right. Okay, well...

323
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,834
I know you have a job to do.

324
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:12,737
And I am more than willing
to give you 57A,

325
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,739
in exchange for

326
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:18,710
60 crates of water, 30 blankets,
50 pounds of fresh fruit,

327
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:20,645
and a few magazines.

328
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:24,048
What if I refuse?

329
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,084
What will you do?

330
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:30,021
Well, I'd be willing
to give you 57A,

331
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,589
just not alive.

332
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,726
We need them alive.

333
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:36,394
Exactly.

334
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:39,030
I'm gonna count to three.

335
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:41,399
You'll disappear

336
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,167
or get a severe beating.

337
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,370
I'm gonna take that as a no.

338
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,405
One...

339
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,207
two...

340
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,086

341
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:14,065

342
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,642
It's simple economics.

343
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,711
Our lives are worth something.

344
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:33,184
60 crates of water,
30 blankets...

345
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,019
You...

346
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,521
you're coming with me.

347
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,456
The manager is gonna be

348
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,690
very unhappy with you.

349
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,626

350
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,067
I would think this manager

351
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,469
wouldn't be too happy
with you either.

352
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:54,005
So if he wants
to talk to me,

353
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:56,474
I'll be right here.

354
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:58,042
Manager doesn't come down here.

355
00:17:58,044 --> 00:18:02,480
Well, looks like
we have a standoff.

356
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:05,550
I'll tell you what.

357
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:07,185
I can be flexible.

358
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:10,188
So I'll go talk to this manager,

359
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,824
but while I'm gone,
you're going to stay right here,

360
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:14,692
as our guest.

361
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,094
How's that sound?

362
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,033
We'll be back.

363
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:32,810
Yeah!

364
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:34,812

365
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,786

366
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,913
Wait, back up a little.

367
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:11,282
So you set the snake loose?

368
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:12,917
Yes, ma'am.
To track down the body?

369
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,552
Yes, ma'am.

370
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:16,220
Snakes have an excellent
sense of smell.

371
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:17,755
Well, now I know.

372
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:19,757
And your prime suspects

373
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,893
are a clown and an acrobat?

374
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:23,794
Yeah.

375
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:25,763
Ain't this one a doozy?

376
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,565
Your victim, Lila Valeska,

377
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:29,700
was killed by
a large knife or hatchet.

378
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,836
Multiple blows to the
head and upper torso.

379
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,071
Around 3:00 yesterday afternoon.

380
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:36,307
From 2:30 to 4:15,
both Grayson and Lloyd

381
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:37,975
were in the ring
for the matinee.

382
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:39,644
Well, how precise
is that time of death?

383
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:41,679
Give or take
45 minutes.

384
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,582
Still possible then,
but cutting it close.

385
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:46,217
Hold and press your guys,

386
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:47,818
but keep looking.

387
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,587
Yeah, boss. Forensics is
working the crime scene now.

388
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:52,423
We're going through
her phone records.

389
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,195
All right!

390
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,697
We're gonna send
the rest of you home now,

391
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,300
but the investigation
is ongoing.

392
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:03,968
Nobody leaves town.

393
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,736
And listen up.

394
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,171
No more fighting!

395
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:09,040
Look where your friends are.

396
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,445
What good is this feud
doing you?

397
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:24,922
I like it when
you act all tough.

398
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,893
"Nobody leave town."

399
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,761
Sounds better when you say it.

400
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:32,129
(laughs)

401
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,798
I feel like we should

402
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,733
finish up our date.

403
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,335
Do you want
to come over tonight?

404
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:38,769
I can cook you dinner.

405
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,838
Sure. That sounds good.

406
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,640
Good.

407
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:43,774
Get some rest.

408
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,810
I will try. See you later.

409
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:50,982
I have to ask.

410
00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:53,684
If you were to guess, who
do you think killed Lila?

411
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:55,086
I try not to guess.

412
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,321
I work the suspects
and I wait on forensics.

413
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,490
Excuse me.

414
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,862
Am I speaking to
Detective James Gordon?

415
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:07,431
Yes.

416
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:12,203
Then this must be Dr. Thompkins,
the medical examiner.

417
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:14,972
I'm sorry, how did
you know who we were?

418
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:16,874
My name is Paul Cicero.

419
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,009
I'm a psychic

420
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:20,111
with the sideshow.

421
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,980
Lila Valeska was
an old friend of mine.

422
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:24,982
A psychic. I see.

423
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:26,917
How could I help you,
Mr. Cicero?

424
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:31,922
I sense that you don't think
Owen or Alphonse are guilty.

425
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,157
You must be psychic.

426
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:34,725
In which case,

427
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:36,694
perhaps you'd like to hear
the message

428
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:39,764
Lila sent me
from the other side.

429
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:41,999
Thanks, Mr. Cicero,
we're not quite looking at

430
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:43,734
the other side just yet.

431
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:46,370
As you wish.
I'm merely a messenger.

432
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:48,739
What's the message?

433
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:51,075
Thank you, Doctor.

434
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:54,111
Lila told me

435
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:55,913
that the servant

436
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:57,415
of the Devil

437
00:21:57,417 --> 00:22:01,085
lies in the garden
of the Iron Sisters.

438
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:03,054
The Iron Sisters?

439
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:04,255
What does that mean?

440
00:22:04,257 --> 00:22:05,723
I don't know.

441
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:06,824
We'll get right on it.

442
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,392
I don't think sarcasm

443
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:09,927
is your métier, James.

444
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:11,862
Make of the message
what you will.

445
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:13,130
Good day to you both.

446
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:15,433
(whistles a short tune)

447
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,808
Well, that wasn't
very open-minded of you.

448
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,143
Oh, come on, Lee.
He's a fraud.

449
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:27,511
He's gonna go straight
to the press

450
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,347
and say he's consulting
on the case.

451
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:30,748
He's looking for publicity.

452
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,116
Maybe.

453
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,919
If you were gonna send a message

454
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:36,287
from beyond the grave,

455
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:37,988
don't you think
priority number one

456
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,957
would be the killer's name
and not a riddle?

457
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,425
Who knows how it works?

458
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,428
All right.
I'm not gonna argue with you.

459
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,297
Good.

460
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:47,998
Later, then.

461
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:50,935
Later.

462
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,278
(footsteps approaching)

463
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,514
They called to confirm

464
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:07,017
your meeting with the board
of Wayne Enterprises tomorrow.

465
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:09,286
Excellent.

466
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:11,188
I was afraid
they'd postpone again.

467
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,390
Well, I'll say it one more time.

468
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:14,058
I think that, uh,

469
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,927
it's an incredibly bad idea,
Master Bruce.

470
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,129
I think it's reckless,

471
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:20,164
I think it's
premature,

472
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:21,966
and, quite frankly,
I think it's bloody dangerous.

473
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:24,101
And we've already been over this
100 times, Alfred.

474
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,071
My mind is made up.

475
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:31,175
Can you pass me
that file over there?

476
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:34,044
The file...

477
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:35,846
Well...

478
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:38,048
I've said my piece.

479
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,518
If we're both found

480
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,052
dead in a ditch,

481
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:44,422
don't blame me.

482
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:53,130

483
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,595
Ta-da.

484
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:27,932
Nah.

485
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:29,700
No?

486
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:32,203
Jim loves me in this color.

487
00:24:32,205 --> 00:24:34,004
It's too obvious.

488
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:35,940
You gotta dress like
you're not trying,

489
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:37,575
like you're on your way

490
00:24:37,577 --> 00:24:39,143
to go meet
some other guy.

491
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,679
To go... sailing,

492
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:43,681
or whatever.

493
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:45,883
Really? Sailing?

494
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,355
Okay.

495
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:54,625
♪ ♪

496
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,838
Oh, my God.

497
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,340
You like?

498
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:11,108
Oh, my God.

499
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,577

500
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:14,812
Oh, my God!

501
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:16,647
What's wrong?

502
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:17,848
No, it's good.

503
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,016
It's my sister's recipe;

504
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,217
she's a really,
brilliant cook.

505
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:21,685
I was thinking
of my sister,

506
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:22,987
and it came to me:

507
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:24,188
Mm-hmm?
I think I know

508
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,856
what the blind man's
message means.

509
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,224
The servant of the devil

00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:29,126
lies in the garden
of the Iron Sisters?
Oh?

511
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:31,095
It's Arkham Bridge.
Hmm?

512
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:33,197
The Iron Sisters.
Arkham Bridge.

513
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,598
The towers.

514
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,000
They're called, uh,
Mary and Betty?

515
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:37,968
Mmm. I remember,
as a kid,

516
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,370
we used to call
them that, but...

517
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:42,172
Right. And there's a park,
um, under the towers

518
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:44,041
on the Gotham side.

519
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,210
A garden? It all fits.

520
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,711
Lee...

521
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,380
it fits an
impossible story.

522
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:50,781
He didn't speak
with Lila Valeska;

523
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:52,883
she's dead.
So you say!

524
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,785
Come on, you're a doctor.
A scientist.

525
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:56,186
There are plenty of things
in this world

526
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:57,655
that can't be explained
by rational science.

527
00:25:57,657 --> 00:25:58,856
Yeah, people who enjoy

528
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:00,057
folk dancing, for instance.

529
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,625
Doesn't mean ghosts exist.

530
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:03,294
You're very arrogant
in your certainty.

531
00:26:03,296 --> 00:26:04,728
What if this is

532
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,897
a clue to a murder?

533
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,365
The poor woman!

534
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:11,635

535
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:13,304
Fine. I'll go myself.

536
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:15,339
Thank you.
Sure.

537
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:17,074
I'll come with you.
Okay.

538
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,909
We'll go together.
First thing in the morning.

539
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,077
Morning?

540
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,280
Now?

541
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:24,748
You want to go now?

542
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,151
It's only a half a mile away.

543
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:28,819
It's dark.

544
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:30,321
I have a flashlight.

545
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:32,256

546
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,958

547
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,193

548
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:38,829
So what are we looking for,
exactly, do you think?

549
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:40,197
I know, I know.

550
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,099
This is probably a
complete waste of time.

551
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,268
Thank you for doing this.
No problem.

552
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,771
But, uh, let's not make
a habit out of it, okay?

553
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,273
This is no place
for a lady.

554
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,141
Ha!

555
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:53,177
What do you
mean, "ha"?

556
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:54,912
You're a hypocrite.

557
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:56,814
You say you want
a strong woman

558
00:26:56,816 --> 00:26:59,016
to share this crazy life
you've chosen,

559
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:00,250
but when push
comes to shove,

560
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:02,820
you want me to stay home
and bake cookies.

561
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,724
Not cookies,
necessarily.

562
00:27:06,726 --> 00:27:08,859
Pie. Any kind of pie.

563
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:10,427
Ha, ha!

564
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:14,732
So if someone were
to throw something

565
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:16,133
from a car on the bridge,

566
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,401
this is where it would land.

567
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:18,802
(Gordon sighs)

568
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,305
Yeah, I guess you're right.

569
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,774
(sighs)

570
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:38,322
Lee...

571
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:40,791

572
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,330
THFC.

573
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:47,831
What does that mean?

574
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,833
The Hellfire Club.

575
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,136
It's a Satanist cult.

576
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:55,406
Committed a string
of ritual murders.

577
00:27:55,408 --> 00:27:58,442
But they haven't been active
for a decade or more.

578
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:00,444
I guess they're back.

579
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,947
No.

580
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:06,183
No, I don't think so.

581
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,421
Hey, Sarge, I'm gonna need

582
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:13,090
a couple of mobile units
to pick some people up.

583
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:15,826
But listen...
they need careful handling.

584
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:26,570
Sir, they're in
three and four.

585
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:27,771
Thanks, Zeke.
Neither of them knows

586
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:28,939
the other one's here, right?

587
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:30,340
Right, like you said.

588
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:31,809
Ah, good work.

589
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:33,777
Just bear in mind
that you could be wrong

590
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:35,412
about all of this.
I will bear
it in mind.

591
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:36,747
I will, but
I'm not wrong.

592
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:38,849
So go on home now, lady.

593
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:40,651
Hey.

594
00:28:40,653 --> 00:28:43,020
We were having
a perfectly lovely evening.

595
00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:44,988
I am not the
one who wanted

596
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,690
to go out searching
for Satanist hatchets.

597
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:48,759
You... know what I wanted to do.

598
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:50,861
You're right.

599
00:28:50,863 --> 00:28:51,895
Uh-huh. I'm sorry, what?

600
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,700
I tend to get
overly enthusiastic

601
00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:58,068
about things.
It's an issue for me.

602
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,603
My mom always said...

603
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,572
Oh, who gives a crap
what my mom said, right?

604
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:03,640

605
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:04,875
Have a good night, Jim.

606
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:06,076
Let me know
how it all turns out.

607
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,811
Good night, Lee.

608
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:10,414
Wait!

609
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:23,494
What you said earlier,

610
00:29:23,496 --> 00:29:25,429
about hypocrisy,
sharing lives...

611
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,833
You're right. Let's go.

612
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,402
I'm what?

613
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,808
Right.

614
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,743

615
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:51,488
Good evening,
Mr. Cicero.

616
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,557
Sorry to bring you
down here so late.

617
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,594
Good evening, Detective Gordon;

618
00:29:57,596 --> 00:29:59,062
Dr. Thompkins.

619
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:01,465
How did you...

620
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,667
He smells your
perfume.

621
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:05,369
We solved the message
Lila sent you.

622
00:30:05,371 --> 00:30:06,937
Oh?

623
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:09,373
Took us to Arkham
Bridge Park.

624
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:12,109
We found a hatchet there

625
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:13,644
with Satanist symbols

626
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:14,978
scratched
into it.

627
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,613
Dear lord.

628
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:18,115
You know what that hatchet
means, Mr. Cicero?

629
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:19,583
Tell me.

630
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:21,451
It means you're
an accessory to murder.

631
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:23,420
Such drama.

632
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:25,889
I merely passed along a message.

633
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:27,658
A message
from the dead.

634
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,792
Didn't happen.

635
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:30,160
Which means

636
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,062
you invented
the message...

637
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:34,565
which means you had someone
plant the hatchet

638
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:36,466
for us to find.

639
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:38,101
You wanted
us to think

640
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:40,470
Satanist were responsible
for Lila's death.

641
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:41,805

642
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:43,407
You're protecting somebody.

643
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:45,409
Lila spoke to me.

644
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:46,677
That's all.

645
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,548
You know,

646
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,784
a hatchet is
a clumsy ploy.

647
00:30:53,786 --> 00:30:56,186
You wouldn't try it
unless you were desperate.

648
00:30:57,722 --> 00:31:00,591
Which suggests
you're protecting someone close.

649
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:03,493
Someone you love.

650
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:05,162
This fantasia

651
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:09,066
was conjured
in your blinkered mind.

652
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:12,135
If you could only see
what I see...

653
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:14,471

654
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:16,440
Hi, Jerome.

655
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:17,741
Please.

656
00:31:17,743 --> 00:31:18,942
Take a seat.

657
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:21,178
You know Mr. Cicero,

658
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,746
from the show.

659
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:24,047
Yes, sir.

660
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,049
Hello, Mr. Cicero.

661
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,018
Good evening,
Jerome.

662
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:36,793
Do you know why you're here?

663
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:38,896
Did you find out
who killed my mother?

664
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:40,631
You killed your mother, Jerome.

665
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:43,667
Me?

666
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:45,535
You killed her up on that hill

667
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:47,604
and Mr. Cicero let you clean up
in his trailer.

668
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:48,939
He told you
to scratch

669
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:50,474
the Satanist stuff
on the hatchet

670
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:51,675
and throw it
off the bridge.

671
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:54,544
Sir, that's... absurd and...

672
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:55,879
and offensive.

673
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:57,848
But it's the truth.

674
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,182
What I don't know
is why this man

675
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:01,818
risked so much
to help you.

676
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,553
I think he's your father.

677
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,091
You don't know
what you're talking about.

678
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,260
My father was a sea captain.

679
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,063
GORDON:
Am I wrong,

680
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:14,131
Mr. Cicero?

681
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:15,766
Yes.

682
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:17,100
He was a sea captain.

683
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,969
His name was Sven Karlsen.
He died at sea.

684
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:22,139
What was the name of his ship?

685
00:32:22,141 --> 00:32:24,675
He worked on a lot
of different ships.

686
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:26,910
The one he went down in.

687
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,214
She never said.

688
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:34,151
We can do a blood test
to prove I'm right.

689
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:36,520
It takes only half an hour
to get a foolproof result.

690
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:37,988
Isn't that right, Dr. Thompkins?

691
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,923
Yes.

692
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:42,259
Save yourself a needle.

693
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:44,728
I do hate needles.

694
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,732
I'm sorry, Jerome.

695
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:51,568
What are you talking about?

696
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:54,204
He's right.

697
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:57,140
I am your father.

698
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,909
No, you're not.
Why would you say that?

699
00:32:58,911 --> 00:33:01,578
You must have suspected
the truth.

700
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,213
You're not my father.
My mother would never...

701
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:04,881
Your mother was

702
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:06,950
a cruel woman;
she was often unkind to me,

703
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:09,686
but she did once love me,

704
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:12,289
in her way.

705
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:15,659
And she loved you very much.

706
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:18,795
That's why she gave you
a better father.

707
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:23,867

708
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,407

709
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:36,646
My mother

710
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:37,814
was a cold-hearted whore

711
00:33:37,816 --> 00:33:39,349
who never loved anyone.

712
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:41,084
And she'd never touch

713
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:44,621
a pathetic old creep like you.

714
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:46,690
All these years,

715
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,692
do you think I was kind to you

716
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,093
because I'm such a good man?

717
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:52,963
If I wasn't your father,

718
00:33:52,965 --> 00:33:56,800
would I help you as I have,
after what you did?

719
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:03,607
My father... Hm.

720
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:05,242
I'll be damned.

721
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:10,013
Oh, that's very funny.

722
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:12,182

723
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:14,151

724
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:16,887
Ba-doom-shh!

725
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:20,323
Looks like the bitch got me
with a zinger in the end.

726
00:34:20,325 --> 00:34:23,160
Why did you kill
your mother, Jerome?

727
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:25,862
Oh, you know how mothers are.

728
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:29,800
She just kept pushing.

729
00:34:29,802 --> 00:34:31,701
And I'm like, fine, Mom.

730
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,170
Be a whore.

731
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:35,705
Be a drunken whore, even.

732
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,040
But don't be

733
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:40,077
a nagging drunken whore.

734
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,812
You know?

735
00:34:41,814 --> 00:34:43,680
Don't come yell at me

736
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:45,248
to do the dishes

737
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,117
if you've been banging

738
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,386
a clown in the next room!

739
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:53,657
You know?

740
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,926

741
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,946
Long night, huh?

742
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:19,683
Guess it got kind of ugly.

743
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:21,118
Yes, it did.

744
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,787
You okay?

745
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,889
I'm good.

746
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:27,290

747
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:29,292
Truly.

748
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:32,429
It was ugly, but it was also
kind of thrilling.

749
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:34,364
Thrilling?

750
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:37,200
Thrilling and scary.

751
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:41,004
Like-like looking
down a deep, dark tunnel.

752
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:42,239

753
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,979
Thanks for letting me be there.

754
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:54,117
You are an unusual woman.

755
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:57,454
You just don't know many women.

756
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:01,424

757
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,437
Can we go home now?

758
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,574
Mm-hmm.

759
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,371

760
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,218
Hello, Penguin.

761
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:06,356
Victor.

762
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:08,258
How nice.

763
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,327

764
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:15,265
Don Falcone thinks
you're messing up.

765
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:18,802
You don't know
how to run a club.

766
00:37:18,804 --> 00:37:20,437
Your numbers...

767
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:22,872
stink.

768
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,242
With all due respect...

769
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:27,477
I didn't come here to talk.

770
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:30,981
Good manners cost nothing,
you know?

771
00:37:30,983 --> 00:37:33,049

772
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:39,289

773
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:41,091

774
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,902

775
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:56,806
Relax.

776
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:58,642
He's harmless.

777
00:37:58,644 --> 00:38:00,343
Say hi, Butch.

778
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,012
Hi.

779
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,248
Falcone didn't want
to throw him away,

780
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,950
so I worked on him
in my basement

781
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:08,585
for a couple of weeks.

782
00:38:08,587 --> 00:38:10,854
He's a whole new man.

783
00:38:10,856 --> 00:38:12,522
Right, Butch?

784
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:13,990
Yes, sir, Mr. Zsasz.

785
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:17,494
Butch knows the club scene
up and down.

786
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:19,296
He'll help you out.

787
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:22,232
But he's...

788
00:38:22,234 --> 00:38:24,334
He's Butch Gilzean.

789
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:25,935
He's loyal to Fish Mooney.

790
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:28,004
And he'll do...

791
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:30,874
exactly what you say.

792
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,977
Really?

793
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:35,478
Really.

794
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,580

795
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:41,351
Hey, Butch,

796
00:38:41,353 --> 00:38:43,553
dance for me.

797
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:49,893
I do good work.

798
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:12,382

799
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:26,629
Good morning, everyone.

800
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:28,431
Good morning, Bruce.

801
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:29,699
Welcome to Wayne Enterprises.

802
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:30,934
So happy to see you.

803
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:33,470
Thank you for
meeting with me.

804
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:37,340
I have some questions

805
00:39:37,342 --> 00:39:38,708
regarding Wayne Enterprises
business affairs.

806
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,876
Of course.

807
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,444
It's your company, after all.

808
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:43,413
Fire away, young man.

809
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:45,882
I have two main areas
of concern.

810
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:48,017
Underworld involvement
in the Arkham Project.

811
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,520
And chemical weapons
manufacture

812
00:39:50,522 --> 00:39:52,956
at our Wellzyn affiliate.

813
00:39:58,596 --> 00:39:59,996
That's great.

814
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:01,598
Congratulations.

815
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,966
We wanted to thank you.

816
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:04,768
If you hadn't figure
out who killed Lila

817
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,803
and talked to sense
to us the way you did,

818
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:08,538
our families never
would have reconciled,

819
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,340
and we could've never
gotten together.

820
00:40:10,342 --> 00:40:13,109
Just doing my job.

821
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:14,677
Hey, if we have a son,
we'll name him Gordon.

822
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,646
Well...

823
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:17,981
we'll discuss that,

824
00:40:17,983 --> 00:40:19,048
but we're certainly

825
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,583
very grateful.

826
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,118
Sure.

827
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:32,429
Why so happy?

828
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:34,564
Happy customers.

829
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:35,665
That's not it.

830
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:36,866
It's something else.

831
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,969
You got laid, didn't you?

832
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:42,439
That's impressive.
You slept somewhere

833
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:45,141
without razors
and you smell like ladies' soap.

834
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:47,210
Easy catch.

835
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,751
I can only conclude

836
00:40:54,753 --> 00:40:57,487
that high-level individuals
or groups

837
00:40:57,489 --> 00:40:59,556
within Wayne Enterprises
have colluded

838
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:02,759
in corruption,
bribery, racketeering,

839
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:05,028
and unethical medical research.

840
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,130
Thank you for
that input, Bruce.

841
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:08,832
I'm so sorry if
you've been alarmed

842
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:11,401
or upset by these
shocking stories

843
00:41:11,403 --> 00:41:13,536
and rumors
you've been exposed to.

844
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:15,572
These are much
more than rumors.

845
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:17,407
We'll look into them thoroughly
and carefully, of course.

846
00:41:17,409 --> 00:41:19,742
Bruce, let's be fair.

847
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:23,046
You've told us nothing with any
substantive proof behind it.

848
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,017
I haven't told you all I know.

849
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:30,053
No?

850
00:41:30,055 --> 00:41:31,688
What else is there?

851
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,957
I hope you do look closely
into these issues.

852
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:36,559
Because I'll be raising them at
the next shareholders' meeting

853
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:38,895
with a view
to possible legal action.

854
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:40,964
Dear me.

855
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:43,199
Legal action?

856
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:44,901
These are all
very deep waters

857
00:41:44,903 --> 00:41:46,436
for such a young man.

858
00:41:46,438 --> 00:41:48,438
My youth is not relevant.

859
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,573
Except that if I were a man,

860
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:53,443
I would be chairing this board.

861
00:41:53,445 --> 00:41:55,678
And I would be sure
that Wayne Enterprises

862
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,913
was run honestly.

863
00:41:56,915 --> 00:41:58,748
Thank you for your time.

864
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:20,570
The manager says
you have a deal.

865
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:23,106
You go up and see him,

866
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:24,541
I stay here.

867
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:32,482
What's your name?

868
00:42:32,484 --> 00:42:34,017
Schmidt.

869
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,186
Your first name.

870
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:39,622
Thomas.

871
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:41,257
Thomas.

872
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:43,326
Welcome.

873
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:46,129
Why don't you

874
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:48,932
take off that heavy gear

875
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:51,000
and relax?

876
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:54,938
My family's gonna show you
a good time.

877
00:42:70,803 --> 00:43:54,938
