1
00:00:03,758 --> 00:00:05,192
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:08,856 --> 00:00:10,757
Fish Mooney's alive.

3
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:12,058
You've been playing me for a chump.

4
00:00:12,092 --> 00:00:14,293
No! No. No. No! No!

5
00:00:14,328 --> 00:00:18,564
You better stop this machine
right now, because if I die,

6
00:00:18,887 --> 00:00:20,888
Don Falcone is gonna send a team up here

7
00:00:20,922 --> 00:00:22,556
to skin you alive

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,091
and slaughter your family.

9
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:28,362
That man who was thrown from the roof...

10
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:29,730
The killer removed his adrenal glands.

11
00:00:29,764 --> 00:00:31,765
Essentially, it's the fear gland.

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,701
GCPD!

13
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:38,072
He's still out there.

14
00:00:50,285 --> 00:00:52,486
Oh!

15
00:01:10,338 --> 00:01:12,339
Hello?

16
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:23,017
Who are you?

17
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:30,858
Oh!

18
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:55,516
How you doing?

19
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,751
Jump! Get up!

20
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:02,489
Slug 'er!

21
00:02:02,524 --> 00:02:03,657
Come on!

22
00:02:03,692 --> 00:02:05,192
No, no.

23
00:02:05,227 --> 00:02:07,328
No! No!

24
00:02:07,362 --> 00:02:09,697
I'm dreaming, right?

25
00:02:09,731 --> 00:02:11,532
Oh, I hope so, lady.

26
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:13,801
I sure hope so.

27
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:16,403
All right...

28
00:02:16,438 --> 00:02:19,173
Oh, hell.

29
00:02:19,207 --> 00:02:21,035
What's up with them?

30
00:02:22,544 --> 00:02:24,812
What are they waiting for?

31
00:02:27,048 --> 00:02:28,849
- Ow!
- Keep doing it.

32
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:30,751
First man that comes at a new girl

33
00:02:30,785 --> 00:02:32,753
nearly always gets
jumped by the second man.

34
00:02:33,724 --> 00:02:34,788
Is that right?

35
00:02:48,403 --> 00:02:50,604
Here's a promise, boys.

36
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,874
The first of you to come
at me will die like...

37
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:55,743
that.

38
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,413
The second will die slow.

39
00:03:04,075 --> 00:03:06,053
So, boys...

40
00:03:09,368 --> 00:03:11,592
who's first?

41
00:03:20,802 --> 00:03:23,203
Thank you. That was wonderful.

42
00:03:23,238 --> 00:03:25,205
Yeah. Taxi!

43
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,009
And no case files. And we
didn't mention work once.

44
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:31,411
There's hope for us yet.

45
00:03:31,446 --> 00:03:33,413
Yeah.

46
00:03:33,448 --> 00:03:36,250
So, what is this, our third date?

47
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:38,886
I believe that's correct.

48
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,389
Three dates, and I still
haven't been to your apartment.

49
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:45,592
Well, what particular room in my
apartment are you interested in?

50
00:03:45,627 --> 00:03:48,028
- Oh, I don't know. How's the kitchen?
- Small.

51
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:49,563
- Living room?
- Dark.

52
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:51,532
- What about the bedroom?
- The bedroom I think you'd like.

53
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:53,433
Yeah? Taxi!

54
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:56,103
But not tonight.

55
00:03:56,137 --> 00:03:58,038
No?

56
00:03:58,072 --> 00:03:59,907
I have to get a good night's sleep.

57
00:03:59,941 --> 00:04:01,875
I start a new job in the morning.

58
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,645
A new job? Congratulations. Since when?

59
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:07,447
I heard this morning. I
didn't want to spoil dinner

60
00:04:07,482 --> 00:04:09,216
with a whole big discussion about it.

61
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,818
Why would it spoil dinner?

62
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:14,488
I'm coming to work at the GCPD.

63
00:04:14,522 --> 00:04:17,424
I'm you're new medical examiner.

64
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,725
You're kidding.

65
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:21,628
Wow. That's great.

66
00:04:22,525 --> 00:04:23,602
Is it?

67
00:04:23,777 --> 00:04:27,410
Of course. I mean, I was the one
that suggested you work there.

68
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,653
- Yes, but now it's real.
- So? Good.

69
00:04:30,653 --> 00:04:32,654
We'll see, won't we?

70
00:04:38,828 --> 00:04:40,829
Good night.

71
00:04:54,743 --> 00:04:56,311
Hey.

72
00:04:56,345 --> 00:04:58,446
Gennaro Marx, single, 63.

73
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:00,448
High school English teacher.

74
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:03,422
Same exact surgical
incisions as our last victim.

75
00:05:03,547 --> 00:05:05,687
What are the odds he's
got no adrenal glands?

76
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:07,555
So, what's he doing with them?

77
00:06:20,896 --> 00:06:25,133
Why?

78
00:06:29,103 --> 00:06:30,972
- What's the matter with you?
- Help me!

79
00:06:31,006 --> 00:06:32,907
Why won't you help me, Gerald?

80
00:06:34,376 --> 00:06:35,877
Help me...

81
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:41,057

00:06:48,623 --> 00:06:51,057
Do you have everything
you need, Master Bruce?

83
00:06:51,758 --> 00:06:53,093
Yes.

84
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,900
I can still come with
you, if you want me to.

85
00:07:01,747 --> 00:07:02,936
No.

86
00:07:05,688 --> 00:07:06,973
It wouldn't be right.

87
00:07:07,592 --> 00:07:09,009
No. Of course.

88
00:07:13,714 --> 00:07:15,682
I'll be fine, Alfred.

89
00:07:15,716 --> 00:07:17,984
- You don't have to worry.
- Who said I was worried?

90
00:07:18,455 --> 00:07:20,020
I'll be back before dark.

91
00:07:21,704 --> 00:07:23,356
I've been on this hike before, you know.

92
00:07:24,046 --> 00:07:25,392
Not without your father.

93
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,705
Come here.

94
00:07:33,183 --> 00:07:34,634
He would have approved, you know.

95
00:07:36,177 --> 00:07:38,043
Carrying on the tradition like this.

96
00:07:38,973 --> 00:07:40,223
My father and I stayed overnight.

97
00:07:40,812 --> 00:07:42,766
We woke up early to watch the sunrise.

98
00:07:44,045 --> 00:07:46,012
It's not the same.

99
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:48,048
Well, maybe next year, then.

100
00:07:52,587 --> 00:07:54,387
Well, off you go then.

101
00:08:01,172 --> 00:08:03,473
And then, the worst of it...

102
00:08:03,508 --> 00:08:05,375
Maroni had me locked me inside a sedan

103
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:06,943
and tried to crush me alive.

104
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:10,354
So, well, you can imagine my concern.

105
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,816
Maroni's not a man to let things go,

106
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,719
and I fear he will come
after me in retaliation.

107
00:08:15,753 --> 00:08:18,255
Were you planning to clean up the place?

108
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,357
What?

109
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:23,593
Oh, um, I... I can... if you like.

110
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,197
It needs it. Is that blood?

111
00:08:28,566 --> 00:08:30,600
Perhaps.

112
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:34,170
- But Don Falcone...
- While you're at it...

113
00:08:34,205 --> 00:08:37,374
maybe you could do
something about the design.

114
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:40,711
- The design?
- It reeks of Fish Mooney.

115
00:08:41,746 --> 00:08:43,813
What do you think about the lamps?

116
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,385
Don Falcone, maybe you didn't hear me.

117
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:50,887
I need your protection.

118
00:08:50,922 --> 00:08:52,856
Maroni will surely try and kill me.

119
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,190
Yes.

120
00:08:54,225 --> 00:08:56,593
The lamps should go.

121
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:59,122
Don Falcone, please!

122
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:02,832
Maroni wants my scalp, and
you'd have me redecorate.

123
00:09:05,584 --> 00:09:07,837
This nightclub makes a lot of money.

124
00:09:07,872 --> 00:09:10,206
Without money, we lose influence.

125
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:12,208
Without influence, we lose control.

126
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:15,278
And without control, Maroni killing you

127
00:09:15,313 --> 00:09:17,948
is no longer a hypothetical.
It's a foregone conclusion.

128
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,117
That's why I want to reopen it.

129
00:09:21,152 --> 00:09:22,919
Under your care.

130
00:09:22,954 --> 00:09:24,821
I can have the club?

131
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,325
- It's mine?
- You've earned it.

132
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,361
Your days of sneaking around,
spying on Maroni, are over.

133
00:09:31,395 --> 00:09:33,330
You're with me now.

134
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,098
Publicly.

135
00:09:35,132 --> 00:09:36,766
Things are gonna be much different.

136
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:39,569
So spruce up the place, get it open.

137
00:09:39,604 --> 00:09:42,906
As for Maroni, leave him to me.

138
00:09:44,175 --> 00:09:45,942
What do you got?

139
00:09:45,977 --> 00:09:47,911
Your book where
the victim taught English.

140
00:09:47,945 --> 00:09:49,779
Tell you one thing...

141
00:09:49,814 --> 00:09:51,881
Girls didn't look like this
when I was back in high school.

142
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,884
- Easy...
- I'm just sayin'.

143
00:09:55,786 --> 00:09:56,953
Hi, Jim.

144
00:09:56,988 --> 00:10:00,256
Lee. You remember Harvey, right?

145
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,158
- Hi, Lee.
- Hi.

146
00:10:02,193 --> 00:10:04,060
Lee's our new M.E.

147
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:06,596
You're joking.

148
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:08,331
- No.
- Oh, good.

149
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:09,599
You've met.

150
00:10:09,634 --> 00:10:11,701
Oh, Detective Gordon and
I already know each other.

151
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,837
Oh, right. From Arkham?

152
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:15,271
Right. Arkham.

153
00:10:15,306 --> 00:10:18,575
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

154
00:10:18,609 --> 00:10:20,510
You can fill her
in on your cases later.

155
00:10:20,544 --> 00:10:21,811
Dr. Thompkins, will you follow me?

156
00:10:21,846 --> 00:10:24,080
Lots to get you up to speed on.

157
00:10:24,115 --> 00:10:26,082
It was good to see you again, Detective.

158
00:10:26,117 --> 00:10:28,284
It was really good to see you, Doctor.

159
00:10:33,224 --> 00:10:35,358
You have no luck at all, do you, brother?

160
00:10:35,393 --> 00:10:38,094
- What do you mean?
- You find a fine lady like that,

161
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:40,730
and she comes to work with
you in the same building?

162
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,833
- It's a damn shame.
- Why?

163
00:10:43,868 --> 00:10:47,871
Office romance always
ends in tears... tears!

164
00:10:47,905 --> 00:10:51,875
- It's not gonna be like that.
- Trust me. I know.

165
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,947
There.

166
00:10:57,982 --> 00:10:59,549
Holy Mother Mary.

167
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,852
- You got him?
- Staring right back at me.

168
00:11:02,887 --> 00:11:05,188
That's him. That's him.
That's the guy from the pool.

169
00:11:05,222 --> 00:11:08,491
His name is Gerald Crane.
He's a biology teacher.

170
00:11:08,526 --> 00:11:10,827
School doesn't let out for hours.

171
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:13,163
Let's go.

172
00:11:15,332 --> 00:11:17,100
I'm Kelly.

173
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,568
Fish.

174
00:11:18,602 --> 00:11:19,903
Fish?

175
00:11:19,937 --> 00:11:22,405
That's what I said: Fish.

176
00:11:24,008 --> 00:11:26,209
So... where are we?

177
00:11:26,243 --> 00:11:28,044
What is this place?

178
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,547
Some people think it's a prison.

179
00:11:30,581 --> 00:11:32,849
Some think it's Hell.

180
00:11:32,883 --> 00:11:35,685
I just think it's cold, mostly.

181
00:11:40,391 --> 00:11:42,358
Breakfast.

182
00:11:42,393 --> 00:11:45,428
No. Uh-uh.

183
00:11:47,098 --> 00:11:50,600
You got to let the boss eat first.

184
00:11:50,634 --> 00:11:53,169
People call him Mace.

185
00:11:53,204 --> 00:11:55,605
He's the one in charge, hmm?

186
00:11:57,241 --> 00:11:58,875
Okay. Okay.

187
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:00,110
Get up there! Get up there!

188
00:12:00,144 --> 00:12:02,345
Go on! Move!

189
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:39,048
Gerald called in one day
and said he wasn't coming in.

190
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,251
- That's the last I heard of him.
- Let me guess, about three weeks ago?

191
00:12:41,285 --> 00:12:44,053
That's when neighbors
said he up and moved out.

192
00:12:44,088 --> 00:12:46,322
- Unis searched the place. Nothing.
- Hmm.

193
00:12:46,357 --> 00:12:48,391
So what can you tell us about Crane?

194
00:12:48,426 --> 00:12:49,993
He was a good teacher.

195
00:12:50,027 --> 00:12:51,928
Focused. And a good father.

196
00:12:51,962 --> 00:12:55,632
He was very protective of his son Jonathan.

197
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,635
But he could be quiet, too. Somber.

198
00:12:58,669 --> 00:13:00,970
Think it had to do with
his wife... she died six

199
00:13:01,005 --> 00:13:02,138
or seven years ago.

200
00:13:02,173 --> 00:13:04,174
- She died? How?
- Uh,

201
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,642
car accident.

202
00:13:05,676 --> 00:13:08,645
Did Crane ever talk about fear or phobias?

203
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:09,946
Why?

204
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,682
Is someone targeting phobics?

205
00:13:13,984 --> 00:13:14,584
Yeah.

206
00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:17,153
Killing them?

207
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:20,690
- Does this mean something to you?
- These victims,

208
00:13:20,724 --> 00:13:22,358
were they missing their adrenal glands?

209
00:13:22,393 --> 00:13:23,793
How'd you know that?

210
00:13:23,828 --> 00:13:25,695
Uh...

211
00:13:27,898 --> 00:13:30,667
This was an academic paper

212
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:31,868
that Gerald wrote a few months ago.

213
00:13:31,902 --> 00:13:33,203
He asked me to proof it for him.

214
00:13:33,237 --> 00:13:34,704
See, Gerald had a theory

215
00:13:34,738 --> 00:13:38,208
that fear was an
evolutionary flaw in humans.

216
00:13:38,242 --> 00:13:40,710
War, rape, theft, murder...

217
00:13:40,744 --> 00:13:42,512
It was all caused by fear.

218
00:13:42,546 --> 00:13:44,380
- He was obsessed with it.
- So Crane

219
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:47,183
killed these people and took
their glands to test a theory?

220
00:13:47,218 --> 00:13:50,954
No... Gerald wasn't trying to
prove he was right about fear.

221
00:13:50,988 --> 00:13:53,490
He was trying to cure himself of it.

222
00:13:53,524 --> 00:13:54,824
Crane's idea

223
00:13:54,859 --> 00:13:57,026
of curing fear was to
inoculate himself against it.

224
00:13:57,061 --> 00:13:59,195
- Like a disease?
- Exactly. But in order to do so,

225
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,898
he needed a condensed source
of the hormones that cause fear.

226
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:03,500
Phobics.

227
00:14:03,534 --> 00:14:05,435
Crane's preying on them?

228
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,737
Spiking their fear by scaring them

229
00:14:07,771 --> 00:14:10,206
and then killing them in
order to harvest the hormones?

230
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:11,541
Damn!

231
00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:13,076
How much of this stuff does he need?

232
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,277
What do you mean?

233
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,346
How many more people is he gonna kill?

234
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,314
Oh. Of course. Good question.

235
00:14:18,349 --> 00:14:20,316
Depends on how scared he is, I guess.

236
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:21,584
What's he scared of?

237
00:14:21,619 --> 00:14:23,253
In Scottie's phobia support group,

238
00:14:23,287 --> 00:14:25,054
he said he was afraid of failure.

239
00:14:26,357 --> 00:14:29,058
Who isn't? It's
gotta be something else.

240
00:14:29,093 --> 00:14:31,561
- Did you hear?
- Hear what?

241
00:14:31,595 --> 00:14:33,062
That we got a new medical examiner.

242
00:14:33,097 --> 00:14:34,998
Much better than the old one.

243
00:14:35,032 --> 00:14:36,866
And she smells nice.

244
00:14:38,035 --> 00:14:40,003
See, Jim? Competition already.

245
00:14:40,037 --> 00:14:42,005
Look at this.

246
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:45,341
Crane developed protocols
for two inoculations,

247
00:14:45,376 --> 00:14:48,077
himself and somebody else... Subject B.

248
00:14:48,112 --> 00:14:49,179
Ooh!

249
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:51,114
I wonder who that is.

250
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,481
Dad...

251
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,692
Dad?

252
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,427
You okay?

253
00:15:37,461 --> 00:15:39,462
I'm glorious.

254
00:15:41,432 --> 00:15:43,800
It's working, Jonathan.

255
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:46,108
I said it would.

256
00:15:47,438 --> 00:15:49,739
And it's almost your turn.

257
00:15:49,773 --> 00:15:53,910
You will be free of fear forever.

258
00:15:53,944 --> 00:15:55,745
You'll be cured.

259
00:15:58,048 --> 00:15:59,682
Are you ready, Jonathan?

260
00:15:59,717 --> 00:16:01,651
Are you ready, son?

261
00:16:10,932 --> 00:16:13,152
- Thank you for having me.
- My pleasure.

262
00:16:13,427 --> 00:16:15,061
We're friends, right?

263
00:16:15,095 --> 00:16:18,531
- Of course.
- Then let me talk to you as a friend.

264
00:16:18,566 --> 00:16:21,267
You want to have lunch, take a walk,

265
00:16:21,302 --> 00:16:23,603
I'm happy to.

266
00:16:23,637 --> 00:16:25,672
But a sandwich and a
stroll ain't gonna keep me

267
00:16:25,706 --> 00:16:26,839
from killing Penguin.

268
00:16:26,874 --> 00:16:29,142
That little rat is dead.

269
00:16:29,176 --> 00:16:31,177
So be it.

270
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:34,966
Mr. Cobblepot, will this do?

271
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,001
We will not be serving that.

272
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:42,974
No, no, no.

273
00:16:43,008 --> 00:16:45,543
I said lose the drapes, not tie them back!

274
00:16:45,577 --> 00:16:48,179
We're opening in ten hours!

275
00:16:48,213 --> 00:16:51,049
- Sorry.
- Hey, boss...

276
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,484
Ah. They're ready.

277
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,820
Still warm from the printer.

278
00:16:58,524 --> 00:17:01,426
Nothing can go wrong tonight, Gabe.

279
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,761
This is more than an opening.

280
00:17:03,796 --> 00:17:05,763
It's my moment.

281
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:07,498
They're perfect.

282
00:17:07,533 --> 00:17:11,002
Take these to everybody on the list.

283
00:17:12,037 --> 00:17:15,073
But not this one.

284
00:17:15,107 --> 00:17:18,743
This one I want to deliver in person.

285
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,718
I just want a word.

286
00:17:26,752 --> 00:17:28,620
I mean no harm.

287
00:17:34,426 --> 00:17:36,694
That's close enough.

288
00:17:36,729 --> 00:17:39,366
No harm, huh?

289
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:42,800
- So, you're the boss in here?
- I am.

290
00:17:42,835 --> 00:17:44,802
Why you?

291
00:17:44,837 --> 00:17:47,872
I see a lot of tough guys around here.

292
00:17:49,275 --> 00:17:51,910
This is the only blade in the place.

293
00:17:51,944 --> 00:17:54,879
And I'm holding it.

294
00:17:54,914 --> 00:17:56,915
Fair enough.

295
00:18:03,088 --> 00:18:04,689
I want to make a deal with you.

296
00:18:04,723 --> 00:18:07,859
- A deal?
- Yeah.

297
00:18:07,893 --> 00:18:11,663
I think I might have skills
that could be useful to you.

298
00:18:11,697 --> 00:18:13,331
Really?

299
00:18:13,365 --> 00:18:16,434
What skills, exactly?

300
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,841
All kinds.

301
00:18:23,876 --> 00:18:27,645
You protect me from these
animals, and I'll show you.

302
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:32,584
You think you're worth protecting?

303
00:18:32,618 --> 00:18:35,620
You have no idea.

304
00:18:36,655 --> 00:18:38,656
Huh.

305
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:36,414
Can I help you?

306
00:19:36,449 --> 00:19:38,650
I don't think so. Can you?

307
00:19:40,853 --> 00:19:42,720
What do you want?

308
00:19:42,755 --> 00:19:44,722
What I want, the poor have, the rich need,

309
00:19:44,757 --> 00:19:46,191
and if you eat it you'll die.

310
00:19:46,225 --> 00:19:47,926
Is this...

311
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,328
Are you asking me a riddle?

312
00:19:50,362 --> 00:19:52,397
- Do you like riddles?
- No.

313
00:19:52,431 --> 00:19:54,065
So do you give up?

314
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,868
- Friend, lookit...
- Nothing.

315
00:19:56,902 --> 00:19:59,270
The answer is nothing. The
poor have it, the rich need it,

316
00:19:59,305 --> 00:20:01,239
- and if you eat it...
- Who are you?

317
00:20:01,273 --> 00:20:03,108
Edward.

318
00:20:03,142 --> 00:20:04,442
Nygma.

319
00:20:04,477 --> 00:20:08,446
I know who you are.

320
00:20:08,481 --> 00:20:11,082
Then you know that
you're standing too close.

321
00:20:16,922 --> 00:20:19,557
Did you know that male emperor
penguins keep their eggs warm

322
00:20:19,592 --> 00:20:20,959
by balancing them on their feet?

323
00:20:23,062 --> 00:20:25,130
Isn't that neat?

324
00:20:29,135 --> 00:20:31,603
Nice to meet you, sir.

325
00:20:31,637 --> 00:20:33,705
Keep moving.

326
00:20:35,474 --> 00:20:37,809
Will do.

327
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,081
Cell phone records?

328
00:20:43,115 --> 00:20:44,749
And credit card statements.

329
00:20:44,784 --> 00:20:46,818
- Give me a hand.
- Yeah, sure.

330
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:55,794
- Uh, give me a minute.
- Take your time.

331
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:02,634
It's good to see you, old friend.

332
00:21:02,668 --> 00:21:04,169
What are you doing here?

333
00:21:04,203 --> 00:21:08,206
I wanted to invite you
to a party I'm hosting.

334
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:15,246
No, thanks.

335
00:21:15,281 --> 00:21:16,915
I hear you.

336
00:21:16,949 --> 00:21:19,384
Too busy, I suppose.

337
00:21:19,418 --> 00:21:22,587
Are you on a tricky case?
Anything I can help you with?

338
00:21:23,622 --> 00:21:25,924
It worked so well the last time.

339
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,927
I don't want your help.

340
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:32,197
It was a mistake to ask.

341
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:34,799
I don't want you coming here.

342
00:21:35,868 --> 00:21:38,636
You shouldn't treat me this way, Jim.

343
00:21:38,671 --> 00:21:41,206
One day soon, you'll need my help.

344
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,241
You'll come to me.

345
00:21:44,844 --> 00:21:46,678
And walking with a friend in the dark

346
00:21:46,712 --> 00:21:49,647
is better than walking alone in the light.

347
00:21:52,051 --> 00:21:54,953
Good luck with your police work.

348
00:21:54,987 --> 00:21:56,287
And...

349
00:21:56,322 --> 00:21:58,623
please...

350
00:21:58,657 --> 00:22:01,226
reconsider my invitation.

351
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,261
It won't be the same without you.

352
00:22:17,009 --> 00:22:19,077
Do you trust me?

353
00:22:19,111 --> 00:22:21,079
Of course.

354
00:22:21,113 --> 00:22:23,548
I love you, son.

355
00:22:23,582 --> 00:22:25,517
I wouldn't do anything to harm you.

356
00:22:25,551 --> 00:22:27,552
Just go. Go ahead.

357
00:22:41,701 --> 00:22:44,169
You're being a very good boy.

358
00:22:46,372 --> 00:22:48,373
Yes, don't struggle.

359
00:22:48,407 --> 00:22:50,675
Look at me, look in my eyes.

360
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,834
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

361
00:25:23,868 --> 00:25:25,335
How's your first day going?

362
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:27,137
Busy. Good.

363
00:25:27,172 --> 00:25:28,605
Good, well, I got to get back, so...

364
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,640
Yeah. Hey.

365
00:25:30,542 --> 00:25:32,409
Lee.

366
00:25:32,444 --> 00:25:33,777
We can't do that here.

367
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:36,580
Why? Last time, you kissed me
in the middle of the bullpen.

368
00:25:36,614 --> 00:25:38,515
You weren't working here then.

369
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,484
- That makes a difference to you?
- It's not professional.

370
00:25:40,518 --> 00:25:42,019
Well, I should hope not.

371
00:25:43,054 --> 00:25:44,421
Lee...

372
00:25:45,757 --> 00:25:47,257
Oops.

373
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:49,259
Hey, Bullock.

374
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:50,861
Sorry to interrupt.

375
00:25:50,895 --> 00:25:52,062
What's up?

376
00:25:52,096 --> 00:25:53,330
Nothing that can't wait on your love life.

377
00:25:53,364 --> 00:25:54,364
Just business.

378
00:25:58,803 --> 00:26:01,538
How does a
cigar sound? I've got some

379
00:26:01,573 --> 00:26:04,374
beautiful Castros I've been waiting to try.

380
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:06,577
Carmine, talk straight with me.

381
00:26:06,611 --> 00:26:08,278
Why are you doing this?

382
00:26:08,313 --> 00:26:10,747
Granted, Penguin is a money-maker.

383
00:26:10,782 --> 00:26:13,717
How come you're laying all this
grease on me to keep him alive?

384
00:26:13,751 --> 00:26:15,385
What's your angle?

385
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,922
He's clever. And I like to
have a clever man beside me

386
00:26:18,957 --> 00:26:21,291
who knows his place in
life. You know how that goes.

387
00:26:21,326 --> 00:26:23,460
Yeah. All day.

388
00:26:23,495 --> 00:26:24,595
He's clever enough to know

389
00:26:24,629 --> 00:26:26,296
that a freakish little man like him

390
00:26:26,331 --> 00:26:28,832
is never going to be the boss.

391
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:30,467
True enough.

392
00:26:30,502 --> 00:26:33,303
So I'm supposed to give
you a prime asset like that,

393
00:26:33,338 --> 00:26:36,206
and you're gonna bring
out some nice old cigars?

394
00:26:36,241 --> 00:26:38,709
Of course I'll
show my gratitude to you

395
00:26:38,743 --> 00:26:40,511
in a more formal way.

396
00:26:40,545 --> 00:26:42,312
This is not a money thing.

397
00:26:42,347 --> 00:26:45,849
- This is personal.
- I understand.

398
00:26:45,884 --> 00:26:48,152
Do you know Chief Judge Stanley Turnbull?

399
00:26:48,186 --> 00:26:50,254
Of course.

400
00:26:50,288 --> 00:26:52,556
He's the meanest son of a
mother bitch in the courthouse.

401
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,557
Yes.

402
00:26:53,591 --> 00:26:55,893
A hard and righteous man.

403
00:26:55,927 --> 00:26:57,227
Powerful, too.

404
00:26:57,262 --> 00:26:59,263
Put down some good friends of mine.

405
00:27:03,968 --> 00:27:06,436
You bring me his ugly head

406
00:27:06,471 --> 00:27:08,572
and, say, 200 grand,

407
00:27:08,606 --> 00:27:10,574
and you got a deal.

408
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,278
Oh, I'll give you a
better deal than his head.

409
00:27:31,129 --> 00:27:33,764
On my mother's life.

410
00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:36,767
Judge Turnbull.

411
00:27:36,801 --> 00:27:38,702
He was out with a young man.

412
00:27:38,736 --> 00:27:40,370
I had him drugged and brought here.

413
00:27:40,405 --> 00:27:42,606
- Ooh.
- Now he's all yours.

414
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,275
Mine?

415
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,144
I mean, we'll share him...

416
00:27:47,178 --> 00:27:50,214
of course, but, uh, in spirit,

417
00:27:50,248 --> 00:27:51,315
he's yours.

418
00:27:51,349 --> 00:27:52,983
Now smile for the camera.

419
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:57,020
It's beautiful.

420
00:27:58,323 --> 00:28:00,290
We must be missing something.

421
00:28:00,325 --> 00:28:02,793
What about your pal Penguin?

422
00:28:02,827 --> 00:28:04,795
What about him?

423
00:28:04,829 --> 00:28:06,163
He helped us with Flass.

424
00:28:06,197 --> 00:28:08,498
Maybe he'll help us with Crane.

425
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:09,800
No. I'm not going back to him.

426
00:28:09,834 --> 00:28:12,102
- It's worth a try.
- No, it's not.

427
00:28:12,136 --> 00:28:13,570
Then we wait for another body to drop,

428
00:28:13,605 --> 00:28:15,606
because we're not gonna find him here.

429
00:28:18,343 --> 00:28:19,810
Yeah, you're right.

430
00:28:19,844 --> 00:28:22,946
We're never gonna be able to track Crane.

431
00:28:22,981 --> 00:28:24,014
We gotta get ahead of him

432
00:28:24,048 --> 00:28:25,115
by finding out what's driving him.

433
00:28:25,149 --> 00:28:26,783
We know what's driving him.

434
00:28:26,818 --> 00:28:28,518
- He's obsessed with fear.
- Yeah.

435
00:28:28,553 --> 00:28:29,519
But why?

436
00:28:29,554 --> 00:28:31,388
What's he afraid of?

437
00:28:31,422 --> 00:28:34,157
What happened to him
that made him this way?

438
00:28:34,192 --> 00:28:36,693
His wife was killed in a car crash.

439
00:28:38,296 --> 00:28:39,730
Yeah.

440
00:28:39,764 --> 00:28:40,831
Check that out.

441
00:28:45,703 --> 00:28:47,571
Got it. Karen Crane.

442
00:28:47,605 --> 00:28:49,339
Yeah.

443
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:51,842
Says here she died in a house
fire, not a car accident.

444
00:28:51,876 --> 00:28:54,678
You think the coworker was lying?

445
00:28:54,712 --> 00:28:57,147
Three other people said the same thing.

446
00:28:57,181 --> 00:28:59,149
Crane must've lied
about it for some reason.

447
00:28:59,183 --> 00:29:00,484
What happened in the fire?

448
00:29:00,518 --> 00:29:01,818
Article says she was sleeping upstairs

449
00:29:01,853 --> 00:29:03,120
when the fire broke out.

450
00:29:03,154 --> 00:29:05,722
Husband Gerald and son Jonathan, eight,

451
00:29:05,757 --> 00:29:07,758
were downstairs.

452
00:29:09,327 --> 00:29:11,295
Crane was in the house when his wife died?

453
00:29:11,329 --> 00:29:13,363
And didn't save her. No wonder he lied.

454
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:15,098
He's ashamed.

455
00:29:15,133 --> 00:29:17,501
His fear is the reason his wife died.

456
00:29:17,535 --> 00:29:18,869
That's why he's doing this.

457
00:29:18,903 --> 00:29:20,837
Address for the old Crane house. Let's go.

458
00:29:20,872 --> 00:29:23,340
Okay.

459
00:29:42,593 --> 00:29:45,195
Jonathan!

460
00:29:52,036 --> 00:29:54,404
Jonathan!

461
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,474
Stop, Johnny, stop!

462
00:29:57,508 --> 00:29:58,608
Stop there!

463
00:29:58,643 --> 00:30:02,079
We've started the protocol.

464
00:30:02,113 --> 00:30:04,381
It must be completed, it will
be harmful for you otherwise.

465
00:30:04,415 --> 00:30:06,616
I can't... I can't do it again.

466
00:30:06,651 --> 00:30:08,752
Think of it Johnny... No more fear.

467
00:30:08,786 --> 00:30:11,088
I'm not-I'm not even afraid like you.

468
00:30:11,122 --> 00:30:12,456
We're all afraid.

469
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,291
Every man and woman on the planet.

470
00:30:14,325 --> 00:30:16,193
We're all standing at
the edge of the abyss,

471
00:30:16,227 --> 00:30:17,294
paralyzed by fear.

472
00:30:19,464 --> 00:30:20,697
Now, come on, son.

473
00:30:20,732 --> 00:30:22,132
Trust me.

474
00:30:22,166 --> 00:30:25,602
I just want to help you. And mankind.

475
00:30:25,636 --> 00:30:27,404
Mankind, Johnny.

476
00:30:27,438 --> 00:30:30,540
Now you must be brave, hmm?

477
00:30:30,575 --> 00:30:33,744
Come on, son. Are you with me?

478
00:30:33,778 --> 00:30:35,579
Then let's go back to the house.

479
00:30:35,613 --> 00:30:38,782
It'll all be over before
you know it, I promise.

480
00:31:58,737 --> 00:32:00,204
Ah, come on.

481
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:01,739
Come on.

482
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:10,014
What's up, Doc?

483
00:32:17,656 --> 00:32:20,157
The name's Mace.

484
00:32:20,192 --> 00:32:21,659
That's cute, but I like

485
00:32:21,693 --> 00:32:24,128
to give my friends nicknames.

486
00:32:24,162 --> 00:32:26,597
And yours is Doc...

487
00:32:26,632 --> 00:32:28,766
'cause you have such a
wise look in your eyes

488
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,835
for such a big man.

489
00:32:30,869 --> 00:32:33,304
A real little firecracker, huh?

490
00:32:33,338 --> 00:32:34,772
Mm.

491
00:32:34,806 --> 00:32:38,910
A firecracker goes off once
and then just lies there.

492
00:32:38,944 --> 00:32:42,280
What you're looking at
is the Fourth of July.

493
00:32:42,314 --> 00:32:44,615
Come sit by me.

494
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,484
- Does that mean we have a deal?
- Sure, baby.

495
00:32:46,518 --> 00:32:49,220
Well, I have a couple of riders
I would like to talk to you...

496
00:32:49,254 --> 00:32:51,222
Hush, now, baby.

497
00:32:51,256 --> 00:32:54,258
You talk too much and you'll make me mad.

498
00:32:54,293 --> 00:32:56,294
Huh, let's see...

499
00:32:56,328 --> 00:32:58,562
That's rider number one.

500
00:32:58,597 --> 00:33:00,865
Don't call me "baby."

501
00:33:04,002 --> 00:33:05,002
Ah!

502
00:33:07,573 --> 00:33:10,908
My name is Fish Mooney.

503
00:33:10,943 --> 00:33:13,444
I'm in charge now.

504
00:33:35,534 --> 00:33:37,034
GCPD!

505
00:33:37,069 --> 00:33:38,235
- No, no, no!
- Dad.

506
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,604
Come on, we have to go now.

507
00:33:40,872 --> 00:33:42,773
GCPD!

508
00:33:42,808 --> 00:33:44,408
Dad, they are going to arrest you

509
00:33:44,443 --> 00:33:46,077
once they come in here. We have to go now!

510
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:48,412
There's still time. We
can complete the protocol.

511
00:33:48,447 --> 00:33:50,081
Coming in.

512
00:34:00,259 --> 00:34:01,959
What are you doing?

513
00:34:01,994 --> 00:34:03,661
We have to finish the protocol.

514
00:34:03,695 --> 00:34:06,063
- It's the only way.
- Dad, that's too much.

515
00:34:06,098 --> 00:34:08,332
It's the only way.

516
00:34:10,636 --> 00:34:12,870
Look, Dad...

517
00:34:12,905 --> 00:34:14,805
there's not enough time.

518
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,008
It'll be fine.

519
00:34:18,844 --> 00:34:21,078
- I love you, son.
- Stop!

520
00:34:49,737 --> 00:34:51,409
Hands where we can see 'em!

521
00:34:52,844 --> 00:34:54,645
Hands in the air or we'll shoot!

522
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,581
You think I'm afraid of you?

523
00:34:56,615 --> 00:34:59,317
- Not another step!
- Afraid of your guns?

524
00:35:03,755 --> 00:35:05,656
I have no fear!

525
00:35:16,468 --> 00:35:18,803
You take him. I'll get the kid.

526
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,274
Call an ambulance.

527
00:35:24,643 --> 00:35:26,978
Call an ambulance!

528
00:35:27,012 --> 00:35:29,647
It's all right, son! It's all right!

529
00:35:58,464 --> 00:36:00,064
Hello, there, Master Bruce.

530
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:01,299
Well, you certainly took your time.

531
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,568
What, did you stop off for a pie and a pint

532
00:36:03,602 --> 00:36:04,836
on the way out, did you?

533
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:07,405
How long have you been there?

534
00:36:07,439 --> 00:36:09,908
Well, I don't know, about... about an hour.

535
00:36:09,942 --> 00:36:13,044
Just when you started climbing
up that very nasty hill.

536
00:36:13,078 --> 00:36:15,190
Thanks for your help.

537
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,082
Yeah, I never got you down there, you know.

538
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:27,091
You all right?

539
00:36:29,929 --> 00:36:31,262
Come here.

540
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,165
I'm cold,

541
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,301
I'm tired, and my ankle's sprained.

542
00:36:36,335 --> 00:36:38,069
Oh.

543
00:36:38,103 --> 00:36:39,504
Aah!

544
00:36:39,538 --> 00:36:42,974
- I just want to go home.
- You want to go home?

545
00:36:43,008 --> 00:36:45,598
Or do you want to wait
and watch the sunrise?

546
00:36:47,477 --> 00:36:49,447
Like you did with your dad.

547
00:36:52,618 --> 00:36:54,686
Well, Alfred...

548
00:36:55,615 --> 00:36:57,722
we can only stay if you
think you can handle it.

549
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:00,592
If I can handle it?

550
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:03,461
Mate, this place is positively cushy

551
00:37:03,496 --> 00:37:06,998
compared to some of the
places I've slept at.

552
00:37:07,032 --> 00:37:08,533
Cup of tea, you cheeky monkey?

553
00:37:38,364 --> 00:37:41,166
Penguin.

554
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:42,783
Where you going?

555
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,774
Don Maroni.

556
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,423
It's such a pleasure to see you.

557
00:37:52,212 --> 00:37:54,145
Look at you.

558
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,781
From the trunk of my car
to running your own club.

559
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:59,451
The place looks good, Penguin.

560
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,619
Hell of a turnout.

561
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,989
- Yeah.
- How 'bout a table?

562
00:38:05,024 --> 00:38:06,124
Drinks?

563
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,326
My compliments, of course.

564
00:38:10,511 --> 00:38:12,330
Expensive stuff.

565
00:38:12,365 --> 00:38:13,998
Let me see.

566
00:38:17,597 --> 00:38:19,513
I had a little chat with Falcone.

567
00:38:21,073 --> 00:38:24,242
I came here to let you know
that all is kosher between us.

568
00:38:24,276 --> 00:38:29,014
Long as you don't go giving
Falcone any more of my secrets.

569
00:38:29,048 --> 00:38:31,549
- Huh?
- No.

570
00:38:31,584 --> 00:38:34,653
- Nothing like that.
- Of course not.

571
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,054
Grab a glass.

572
00:38:38,457 --> 00:38:43,228
You better hope that old man,
Falcone, lives a long life.

573
00:38:43,262 --> 00:38:46,898
'Cause the second he's out the picture,

574
00:38:46,932 --> 00:38:48,366
so are you.

575
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,621
Master B.

576
00:39:20,132 --> 00:39:21,466
Sunrise.

577
00:39:35,881 --> 00:39:37,182
Oh, hey.

578
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:40,218
How are you? I heard
your suspect was killed.

579
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,020
Came after Harvey and me with a gun.

580
00:39:42,054 --> 00:39:44,356
- Didn't have a choice.
- I'm so sorry.

581
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:46,791
What about his son?

582
00:39:46,826 --> 00:39:49,628
Paramedics were able to stabilize him.

583
00:39:49,662 --> 00:39:52,097
I'm heading over to the
hospital now, to check in on him.

584
00:39:52,131 --> 00:39:53,698
Well, let me know how he is.

585
00:39:53,733 --> 00:39:55,734
I will.

586
00:39:56,734 --> 00:39:59,004
So, settled in here, huh?

587
00:39:59,038 --> 00:40:02,474
- Uh, almost.
- Think you're gonna like it here?

588
00:40:02,508 --> 00:40:05,110
I do. So far.

589
00:40:06,746 --> 00:40:08,647
Good.

590
00:40:08,681 --> 00:40:11,182
Um, I have tickets to the circus.

591
00:40:11,217 --> 00:40:12,651
Do you want to come with me?

592
00:40:12,685 --> 00:40:15,487
- The circus?
- Yeah. They're good.

593
00:40:15,521 --> 00:40:17,489
No, uh, sad elephants.

594
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:22,260
The circus. Sure. Why not?

595
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:24,629
Look, Lee...

596
00:40:24,664 --> 00:40:27,499
Um...

597
00:40:27,533 --> 00:40:30,869
no kissing, here, on the job.

598
00:40:30,903 --> 00:40:32,704
Okay? I'm serious.

599
00:40:32,738 --> 00:40:34,372
Okay.

600
00:40:34,407 --> 00:40:35,774
Okay?

601
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:38,295
If your hard-ass reputation
is worth that much to you.

602
00:40:38,358 --> 00:40:41,646
- This is a place of work.
- Cops have feelings, too.

603
00:40:41,681 --> 00:40:43,715
It's not unprofessional
to show your feelings.

604
00:40:43,749 --> 00:40:46,651
Yeah, it is. Those kinds of feelings, yeah.

605
00:40:46,686 --> 00:40:49,154
Fine. Be that way.

606
00:40:49,188 --> 00:40:51,122
Hey...

607
00:40:52,225 --> 00:40:53,959
I'm just joking.

608
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,060
I'll be discreet.

609
00:41:02,735 --> 00:41:05,308
All right, everyone gather round!

610
00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:13,511
Up until now, there's
been no order in here.

611
00:41:15,748 --> 00:41:18,283
No... structure.

612
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:26,942
Things are gonna change.

613
00:41:40,673 --> 00:41:42,574
She's back.

614
00:41:47,146 --> 00:41:49,147
My eyes.

615
00:41:50,316 --> 00:41:53,919
They took my eyes.

616
00:42:00,793 --> 00:42:02,194
The boy received a massive dose

617
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,362
of condensed hormones...

618
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:06,198
Cortisol, adrenaline...

619
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:10,402
And another compound we're
still trying to identify.

620
00:42:10,436 --> 00:42:13,371
The combination nearly killed him.

621
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:15,640
But he's gonna live?

622
00:42:15,675 --> 00:42:17,242
Yes.

623
00:42:17,276 --> 00:42:18,710
But we ran a CAT scan

624
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:21,413
in order to determine if he
suffered any brain damage.

625
00:42:21,447 --> 00:42:24,449
The results... we've never
seen anything like them before.

626
00:42:24,484 --> 00:42:27,118
The hormones themselves
have long since worn off,

627
00:42:27,153 --> 00:42:28,386
but the effects,

628
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:31,122
they seem to be lingering.

629
00:42:31,157 --> 00:42:34,059
What are you saying?
That he's still in fear?

630
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,961
Well, not just fear.

631
00:42:35,995 --> 00:42:37,095
Jonathan's brain activity shows

632
00:42:37,129 --> 00:42:40,298
he's in a constant state of intense terror.

633
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:42,601
- How long until this goes away?
- Well...

634
00:42:42,635 --> 00:42:45,270
that's just the thing, Detective.

635
00:42:45,304 --> 00:42:48,540
We can't be certain it ever will.

636
00:42:48,574 --> 00:42:52,344
Imagine the thing you
fear most in the world.

637
00:42:53,379 --> 00:42:56,515
Imagine that it's all you see.

638
00:42:56,549 --> 00:42:58,750
Every waking hour.

639
00:43:18,571 --> 00:43:20,390
No, no, no!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
